1,2,"I knew almost nothing about Greek and Roman mythologies prior to reading this book. So, while reading the first two chapters and when I had difficulty following what's going on, particularly who were those characters, I picked up and started reading Edith Hamilton’s Mythology. After finishing the first chapter of that book, I resumed my reading and then I could follow.

The reason for my ignorance was that my teachers in elementary, high school and college did not bother teaching about those gods and goddesses. When people say “god,” for me it should be one of the three persons of one God: the father, the son or the holy spirit. Although, of course, mostly it is the son or the father and rarely the holy spirit). Virgin Mary nor any of the female saints has never been referred to as a goddess. Growing up, when a woman is referred to as a goddess, she must be a fox and not something that can move mountains or create a storm.

Okay. Okay. I had some sketchy knowledge about Mercury, Mars, Venus (the Romans and not the planets, silly!) from the that I used to read as a kid but I did not think that those had Greek equivalents who were created or made popular by Homer (around 850 B.C.) who wrote the , an epic poem about the Trojan War and is among the oldest extant works in Western literature. So, here I am saying hello to: (one of the Titans) who had three children: (ruler of the heaven), (ruler of the sea) and (ruler of the underworld). The three children seem to be evil that they “killed” their father and pound them into pieces. However, Kronus as the father of Gods cannot be killed so he is just there somewhere beneath the earth and he is making himself felt and I think he is like Voldermort in Harry Potter who will be the ultimate villain in the end of this series ha ha.

With the looks of it, Texan guy Rick Rioldan (born June 5, 1964 – ) cleverly used this portion of the Greek mythology and make us believe that Mt. Olympus which is where the 12 Olympians (3 of those I mentioned) reside, is on the 600th floor of Empire State Building in New York and the underworld where Hades stays is in Hollywood in Los Angeles! Good thinking for a guy as old as I ha ha. Two target (captured) markets: the old ones who love reading books about Greek mythology and the young ones who love adventures set in American soil. Clever guy. He is a graduate of University of Texas at Austin in 1986 where in double-majored in English and thought English history including Greek mythology (that’s why he knows his stuff oh so thoroughly). He got his first Master Teacher Award in 2002. So, the guy is not just an ordinary mortal like us, he is a model teacher!

The story revolves around a 12-y/o boy who is a demigod (son of Poseidon) with ADHD and dyslexia. He helps in finding the missing master bolt of his uncle Zeus to prevent the war between the two gods. In his quest, he is helped by , a satyr and also a demigod as she is the daughter of , the daughter of Zeus. Sorry, for lovers of romance, there is no love angle to the story because Athena is Percy’s (or Perseus, his Christian err Greek name) first cousin. The plot is ordinary but teacher Rioldan made sure that he followed the formula for YA: interesting characters, build the climax, throw in the mystery of Oracle, unstoppable action, one conflict after another up to the point of almost losing the quest, then suddenly there goes the resolution and then explain, explain, make the readers believe that everything still makes sense, then as this is a series, hang some stuffs unresolved, and oh the second book oh, put the first chapter of the second book to tease them to read it too.

Everything is in order: Flawless in following the formula to the letter. Witty and funny lines. Brilliant boundless imagination. I just cannot find fault about this book.

And oh, for those who did not like this book because they felt too old for this kind of story? Why did you pick it up in the first place? Aren't the cover and the blurbs obvious?"
2,2,"This book was released when I was about 16 or 17 years old, and at that point I loved Harry Potter (still do) but had moved on to adult literature. Like Middlesex and Brave New World and such. I was not going to read children's books anymore (god I was a book snob). So basically I missed out on the whole Percy Jackson obsession.

Anyways, I won't rehash the plot. I was honestly bored while reading this, and the flow of the book didn't work for me. It was like it had ADD or something. Every time the characters would try to accomplish something, something bigger happened right away. And I know that's the point, but I found it really annoying that they got attacked every 2 hours or something. It was all over the place.

I can see the appeal this holds to younger children and tweens, but I guess as an adult, this book just didn't work for me.

Via the Goodreads rating system I am rating this a 2 because ""it was okay"". I did not enjoy this book but I did not hate it."
3,2,"*boards up windows and doors*
Sooooooooooooo.. I'mdnfingthisat45%. *hides*

It's just not my thing. I'm keeping this sweet because this book is close to my dear friend Francesca's heart (Dear Lord, please don't let her see this) but I really didn't like this. I really really wanted to and was excited about it, but I didn't. I tell myself that it's not the book, it's me. That I'm too old for it, that it's not my fandom (I gave my heart to the boy in the cupboard under the stairs a long time ago) but honestly.. I think it's the book a little bit too. I absolutely ADORE , it's one of my all time favorites, which is also a middle grade but it's written SO much better than this. The first Harry Potters are aimed at a younger audience as well, and the fact that I grew up with it probably plays a huge roll in my thinking, but it's also written so much better than this is. The writing was so simple that it was hard for me to read and a little laughable. I tried to keep in mind that it's for a younger audience, that the characters age but I just couldn't do it.

I liked the mythology, but I could care less about the camp (I can't even remember the name) and just kept comparing everything to HP. I couldn't stop. Maybe if I hadn't seen the movie and didn't already know the end I would have found the plot more interesting but.. I knew the end and didn't find the plot interesting SOOOO.

Percy and his friends were fine. There were nothing special about them that really stood out to me. I didn't dislike them and I didn't like them. They were just meh.

So. Yep. Not my fandom. Not the book for me."
4,2,"2.5 stars Porbably would've lied it more have I read it when I was a kid for the first time. Reading this one as a grown up doesn't do it for me. I liked the Greek mythology in ti of course and think that it's simplistic enough for the younger audince to understand it and be interested in it, but also intricate enough for the adults to nod at the references as well. But at the same time, I didn't like - at all - that every freaking Greek god wanted to be only in North America. The freaking Olymp was ste in America. Are you kidding me with this?! Greek god's would obviously reside in - guess where! - Greece. They could be traveling all over the world of course, including America, but why the heck would ALL of them live there of all places? They have NO history there. That kind of thing seemed way too americanized for my taste. I also feel like Riordan inspired A LOT in Harry Potter. And even readers who love this series should well see that.

**************************************





Amazing start to the beloved Percy Jackson series! First of all, I absolutely love Greek mythology and Rick Riordan did it very well, so that even if you don't know these myths, you won't be confused at all.
I'm sure that Percy is very relatable hero for younger audience, Annabeth is just the kind of heroine I adore and all the characters are really cute!
Riordan's writing is fast, simple and enjoyable. All his characters are interesting and relatable to young readers. And I absolutely love how he blended mythology with real world - Even though, I don't get why would be Olymp and Greek gods in America. Shouldn't they live in Greece?!
I would - of course - like The Lightning Thief more when I was younger and sometimes, it reminded me too much of Harry Potter (Yes, I compared these two. And I'm definitely biased, because Harry Potter is my ultimate favourite series of all time. Duh.)






For me, some things were really good and some not so much - repetitive plot twists, little bit boring toward the middle of the book.
Overall, it was fun, fast and addictive MG read. I enjoyed the mythology, characters and their witty dialogues. And can't wait to read the rest of the series soon!"
5,2,"This is a sheer rip-off of Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

While Rowling's work is impressive and detailed, Riordan's work is a pure copy of hers.

Half-blood boy destined to save the world. Sound familiar?"
6,2,"...well, that was...interesting.

I honestly feel slightly bad for rating this so low since so many people I know love it, but it just made me squirm while I was reading it.

I love the way some authors weave mythology into their stories, like N.D. Wilson and Kyle Robert Shultz. Mythology is cool! So many fascinating creatures and places sprung from the imaginative minds of those who created mythology and legends. But the themes of the original myths? Not so great. Greek mythology, to me, displays the depravity of humanity, and I hate reading those stories. It’s important to understand the baseness of humanity to understand the grace of God, but Greek stories are just depraved.

And yes, I knew that this series was full of mythology before I read it. But I held out hope that there would be some redeeming qualities to it. Unfortunately, I found that it was infused with the same humanism and childish cosmic fits as the original myths.

It’s not the “mythology,” exactly, that bothers me about this story; it’s the themes. It was interesting how at one point, Chiron hinted that God did exist in addition to the Greek gods. But the way the whole system was set up...there’s no way Yahweh could exist. Greek mythology is full of humanism and hopelessness, and it makes me feel sick to think of living in a world like that. How can people live with no hope? The gods are capricious, immoral, and manipulative; it’s quite obvious that they were created in humans’ own image. Since the gods set such a horrible example for humans, it’s no wonder that humans abandon true morality when they follow that system. These childish, glorified humans with superpowers whose temper tantrums cause world wars are not people who deserve homage.

The “good” in the story seems really pointless based on the arbitrary morals presented. If God doesn’t have an active role in the world, then what is good? What is evil? The fates of those in the underworld cast a hopeless, meaningless gloom over the story. Over life. Doing “good,” then, is...what? Something that will get you into Elysium? Which is doing stuff and desperately hoping that it’s enough? There’s no moral foundation to say what’s good and what’s evil.

Additionally, the whole thing with gods running around infatuated, having affairs and having kids all over the place, just...gives me a sick, yucky feeling. I know that’s a big part of the Greek myths, but of course that does not at all make it okay. *shudders* Ugh. I hate stories where people don’t truly value marriage/true love/relationships, just the cheap thrills they can get from casually playing around.

All that said, does have fun parts to it. The perspective is realistic for a twelve-year-old; Percy is a great narrator. Good foreshadowing and snarky/sarcastic humor compose a well-structured novel. I like the theme of friendship and teamwork as Percy, Annabeth, and Grover persevere on their mission. And the chapter titles are hilarious (they remind me a little of the chapter titles from the Afterverse books).

Now, I don’t think reading this series will cause kids to do anything so drastic as to start worshiping the Greek gods, but I personally do not recommend this book. I know I’m reading a lot into this; it is a MG series. But I just didn’t feel okay with it.

It’s possible that I may read the rest of the series at some point in the future since the story is interesting, but I didn’t enjoy this first book very much.

Content: mild violence, Greek mythology (obviously), many references to affairs/extramarital relationships between gods and between humans and gods"
7,2,"No.

Writing for children is not easy. It's not something you do if you can't write for adults. Children are not stupid, they are people in development. Because of that, every author that specialises in child literature has a responsibility, and I'm not talking about the story told, but how it is told. If they read half-sentences, they will think half-thoughts. If they are not challenged to think, their brains won't challenge themselves.

That said, this is not a book for children this is just a badly written book. Author is chewing on someone else's world and not bringing in much new. And being predictable predictable predictable.

P.S.
The only thing America is the center of is mass market production."
8,2,"The observation is hackneyed by this point, but the book just screams 'Harry Potter' knockoff from page one on and very rarely lets up.

The writing is pretty good. The story is adequate, although the big twists are pretty well obvious and the author does little to conceal them. The author is particularly good with action scenes and wisely decides to stick to what he does well. The attempts at witty, angsty teenage banter often seem forced and clichéd. One of the biggest virtues of the book is that it is short and doesn't drag.

Compared to the first book of the Harry Potter series, I was much less bored by 'The Lightning Thief'. But on the other hand, I was at the end a lot less satisfied. I found 'The Sorcerer's Stone' to be dull and drag and was on the verge of giving it up several times, but Rawling's excellent story telling skills made for an ending that was sufficiently dramatic and unexpected that I was willing to give the second book a go. Likewise, the Harry Potter stories are infused with a deeply thoughtful morality and occasional flashes of brilliance that made them more than simply good kid's fare. I rarely got the same feeling from 'The Lightning Thief' and was left with little to chew on or anticipate, so it seems unlikely that I'll follow Percy Jackson's story further any time soon.

I also got the feeling that this book simply couldn't have been written without Harry Potter as a template.

One concern about this book is that I can't figure out really what age of reader is appropriate for it. The book deals with a lot of tough mature themes which I'm not sure I'd consider appropriate reading for a 12 year old, but the language seems more geared to 6th graders. My guess is that by far the biggest audience for the book is adult readers of Harry Potter. While the substance of the book is perfectly appropriate given its genesis in the wildly amoral Greek myths, it stands in marked contrast to the sensitivity of the Harry Potter series which successfully matured its characterization of evil to match the maturity of a reader of roughly the same age as the main character.

Besides all that, my single biggest complaint though is a nerdy one. In the book, several characters are said to be the children of Athena. Athena however was a fiercely virginal goddess both by oath and inclination and it’s completely out of character of the chaste mythic goddess to be having casual affairs with either gods or mortals. Like Artemis, she is supposed to be unconquerable, even by Eros."
9,2,"This would be amazing if I was an child and never had seen the movie but this wasn't the case so I didn't realy enjoyed this one but I'm curious what happens further on in the serie so I will continue plus the bright side of this book serie is the greek mythology wich I love and the fast pacing, gave this book 2 ⭐⭐"
10,2,"I read the e-version and it had some glaring typo and grammar mistakes....but that isn't enough to put me off a book if it's fast paced and contains a balanced mix of realism and fantasy, and a refreshing lack of vampires, zombies and other blood-thirsty examples of the nether world.

Rick Riordan certainly scores with weaving Greek mythology into the present-day US, and as a means of introducing Greek gods to reluctant students, this is as good a means as any.

What I didn't like was the ADHD aspect to Percy's personality - the symptoms described didn't seem to match personal experiences of the condition and there was a tick-box mentality towards cataloguing the known or possibly attributable characteristics of ADHD from which Percy suffers. The flip-side to that is that Percy's ADHD 'weaknesses' are turned into positives in Riordan's take on the making of a god, and given all the uncomfortable press ADHD receives, this has to be a plus for any kid who has been labelled ADHD/Asperge's Syndrome/Autism Spectrum.

For an average 12 year old suffering with ADHD, Percy comes across as being far more perceptive than is possible, able to vanquish his foes without any basis other than being hyperactive and therefore possessing super-fast reflexes. Annabeth seems much older and is set up from their first meeting as a love interest, regardless of her crush on the older, more accomplished Luke. Luke is nicely foreshadowed at the beginning of the book, but Mr D is a little tedious by the end. The description of the Furies is a nice twist, as is the modernisation of Olympus and the reasoning behind its present location.

It's an easy, fast read for the age group at which it's aimed, and despite being an HP copycat, Percy Jackson brings a slew of different characters and adventures to fill some of the breach left with the vanquishing of Voldy. It won't provide the same emotional intensity as HP, but it's a fun-filled way to catch up on some ancient Greek in an American setting."

This is another one of those books that I had passed on, but then got prompted to read it by a mixture of high praise and the fact that all of my friends seemed to have read it - saving the one I read it with.

My verdict is very middle-ground - didn't love it, didn't have it, and ambivalent about continuing.

It was entertaining enough, but there were things that bugged me.

For one, I kind of got bored with the constant battles. It was like reading a game of Zelda or Final Fantasy where the random encounters just got ridiculous. Now, I know some of them made sense, since they were being chased and all, but some of them really were pretty random. Also, I didn't really feel any suspense or anything in the battles. They all seemed too easy, really.

There's a part of me that wants to give it some credit for sticking with the sort of story arc of things like the Odyssey, but there's a bigger part of me that just started rolling my eyes when there was yet another battle.

Intro, battle, travel, battle, intro, battle, travel, battle, travel, battle, intro, battle, ad nauseum.


My second issue was with the characters. Two things: 1) they're not really all that developed and 2) they're all really stupid.

And I don't mean ""learning disability"" - I mean just stupid.

Like how when everyone was ""Hey, I wonder who Percy's dad is"", and completely ignored the very ample evidence that, at the very least, it's got something to do with water.

Like how people thought that Percy stole shit with no evidence that dude was even there. Do they have no security at all on Olympus? Can no god figure out anything?

I mean, sure, the Greek gods are kinda flighty, but damn.

And, lumping this in, little inconsistencies like why does Chiron stuff himself into the magical wheelchair when he's in the camp?


And, speaking of learning disabilities, I can't say I really liked how they were handled in this book. The whole ""your dyslexic 'cause your brain is hardwired for ancient Greek"" makes zero sense. I mean, even assuming that a demigods brain works differently, which I guess it must, it still makes no sense.

Also, the ADHD thing. I wasn't as bothered by it being a built-in battle system (though, actually, yeah, I am, 'cause not all the gods or Greeks are warriors, ya know?) - but I was more bothered, at the time, by things like when Percy is listening to some guy talk and has a random thought about what he's wearing, or something, and this is an example of ADHD.

'Cause, kid, then *everyone* has ADHD. Seriously.

I know the whole thing where Riordan wanted that in there 'cause of his kid , but you'd think someone who has a kid with ADHD would describe it better than having a random side thought when someone is talking to you.


So, yeah - this is why, when rating it, I bumped it down to 2. Entertaining enough, but there were a lot of things that just bugged me.

I can see why people like it, especially those who are less analytically prone than I am, but it just didn't work for me.

I might read the next in the series and see if it gets better, 'cause, like I said, I didn't hate it and it had its charm... and I already have the book... so...

It's not likely to be in the near future, though."
12,2,
13,2,"After teaching the first two chapters of this book to a class (the director of the school had selected it) I was intrigued. I borrowed the book from the school so I could finish it.
But it was all downhill from there.

Here's what I liked about the book:

1. The first two chapters were mysterious and intriguing.
2. The language was rich and interesting, at least in the beginning.
3. The story combined a contemporary setting with Greek mythology.
4. The author portrays disabilities as having special powers behind them. (Not only Percy's dyslexia and ADHD, but also Grover's strange legs and Mr. Brunner's wheelchair.)

Here's what I didn't like about the book:

1. The writing got sloppier and sloppier as the story progressed.
2. The author tried too hard to be humorous too often, so that the story couldn't make up its mind between being a serious fantasy hero's quest and a slapstick comedy. In many places, reading it felt like watching a TV sitcom.
3. Once Percy was given a quest, the plot didn't make much sense from there on out. For one thing, we all knew he wasn't the one who stole the lightning bolt in the first place. The more we learned about who did, the less sense it all made. After finishing the whole book, I'm left with the feeling of ""WHAT??""
4. The monsters were all too easily defeated, making it feel like they were not really threatening at all.
5. Most of the problems that happened on the way from New York to L.A. were overcome before the next problem was encountered, making it feel episodic rather than thickening the plot.
6. The part in the Lotus Casino was an interesting idea, but it would have been better if the reader had more hints before Percy figured out what was happening.
7. The main characters were annoying. I had to follow three annoying young teens all the way from NY to LA and back again.
8. Percy and his buddies were able to complete a task for a god that the god himself dared not even try to do. Yeah, they ran into problems, but it was still a little too easy.
9. It was too predictable. Despite the obstacles, we all knew that Percy was going to get to where he was going in time and do the thing he was supposed to do. No real twists or surprises there (except that the explanation for it was very long and complicated.)
10. The monsters and gods and traitors that tried to fight Percy would tell their life story to him before fighting or tricking him. This was the author's way of explaining their motives to the reader and revealing some facts we need to know. But I don't think monsters would usually tell you everything they know before they try to kill you.
11. There were too many info dumps. In the beginning, they were integrated into the story better. Toward the middle and end, they just seemed so artificial.
12. Percy's dyslexia wasn't realistic. The explanation is that his eyes are hard-wired to read Greek, not English. That doesn't make any sense. Our brains and eyes are hard-wired to learn to make sense of the squiggles of any writing system. Furthermore, I don't think that dyslexics see words in the same way that Percy misread the signs on buildings, with letters jumbled at random.
13. There were many times when Percy went where the author wanted him to go. Like in L.A. when there is only one store that looks open, and it just happens to be the kind of store they are looking for. Or the time when Percy willingly gets in an elevator with a woman and her dog that he senses are monsters because he thinks that waiting for the next elevator will take too much time. Obviously, Percy wouldn't have really done that. The author just wanted Percy to battle that one alone.
14. Percy's dream descriptions were long and didn't make any sense. Maybe someone with more patience would have picked up some clues from them. But I just found them confusing.

Rick Riordon has a lot of talent and potential to write something great. I hope that his writing has improved with later books. However, because this one was a sorely disappointing waste of time, it will be the last of his books that I read."
14,2,"The writing style is accessible to kids and teens, so I give the author a star for that, but god damn if I don't find the premise absolute bunk.

If gods can't even be part of their demigod children's lives, then why are they fucking mortal women in the first place? Seems to be a lot more grief than it's worth, or the gods just don't give a shit about the suffering their mortal lovers had/have to go through.

That makes the gods pretty shitty, and the shittiest of them all being the one responsible for that rule in the first place.

Also, the whole learning disability thing being a touch of divinity. Ha! Look, I'm not making fun of people with learning disabilities. They have to work hard at what many people take for granted, but tying this in with the gods was just a fucking load of cockamamie.

I'm all for urban fantasies and retellings/twists of old mythology and fairy tales, but the premise for this series just doesn't cut it. And to be really able to enjoy a book or series, the premise has to be at least somewhat believable if not perfect."
15,2,"Rick Riordan should learn from Jonathan Stroud and JK Rowling on how write characters and plots. Middlegrade story is not an excuse for juvenile writing with too many cliches, tropes and cringeworthy dialogues. One star.

The idea is cool though. I myself would love to be Poseidon's lovechild. I wouldn't have to worry about sharks and could be the greatest freediver in the whole seven seas. Bye bye expensive, heavy scuba gears, stinging hydroids, and decompression sickness! On that happy note, extra one star."
16,2,"Reading this book was like watching a Disney movie, entertaining but, in a way, somewhat predictable."
17,2,"“The real world is where the monsters are.”
I did it. I’ve finally read The Lightning Thief. This is one of the most well-known middle grade books ever, so I was very curious about it. Also, my friend Álex has been trying to make me read it for almost two years now. So here we are. I’ve read it, but unfortunately it wasn’t for me. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think it’s a bad book at all. Quite the opposite, actually. I think it’s a funny book full of adventures that the target audience for this series is going to enjoy. I’m sure I would have love it if I had read it 10 years ago, but now it was just a boring and predictable book for me.

This is the story of Percy Jackson, a twelve-year-old boy whose life is about to change when he discovers he’s a demigod, a half-blood. And with that premise, Rick Riordan presents us a story full of Greek mythology set in our modern world. I think it was a very cool idea to include such famous gods, goddesses and monsters in Riordan’ own version and, at the same time, doing references to the original myths. Also, I loved the fact that the dyslexia and ADHD are part of the half-blood powers.

My problem with this book and the reason why it was just for me was the plot. I found it way predictable, to the point that it bored me. The traitor was so ridiculously obvious from the beginning that I still can’t believe it took the characters until the end of the book to figure it out. Also, some things were very convenient for my liking.

I was also shocked by the fact that we get to know more about the Olympian gods and goddesses than Percy’s companions through his quest: Annabeth Chase (another half-blood at the Camp Half-Blood and Athena’s daughter) and Grover (a satyr and Percy’s classmate at Yancy Academy). I actually felt they were quite plain in , especially Annabeth. I was a bit intrigued by her, but we barely get to know her in this first book. The only information we have about her is who her parents are and a couple of aspects about her personality, but nothing more.

So I don’t think I’ll continue the series, I’m not invested in the characters or the story. The only reason why I would read the next books is because I like the way Riordan includes Greek myths in the story. But honestly, even that it’s not enough for me to continue reading about Percy and his friends. Nevertheless, I think is a funny and quick read, perfect for its target audience."
18,2,"I will try reading this book another time in my life, and hopefully i will like it more then."
19,2,"Apparently the Percy Jackson series has a cult following akin to that of Harry Potter, which was largely unbeknownst to me until my friend pointed it out. Though I can see why Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief may be appealing to young audiences, it's amazing to me how it is so popular when the books have such little merit.

The Lightning Thief is the first book of the Percy Jackson series written by Rick Riordan. It follows Percy Jackson, son of the Greek God Poseidon, as he journeys to the Underworld to recover Zeus's lightning bolt to prevent a war among the Olympian Gods.

I understand whyis appealing. I understand perfectly. Percy's characterization appeals to young teenagers who have felt, in one point or another in their life, out of place, isolated, alienated, awkward or on the fringe of teenage normality. Percy's poor performance at school is easily explained by the genetics on his father/Greek God's side, his inability to pay attention is because of his instinct to stay alive - essentially, every flaw that has plagued Percy's life is explained by the fact that he is a superior human being. And as a young teenager, or else as a person in a confusing stage in your life, I can certainly see why that is appealing.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying teenagers are petty for finding this sort of novel empowering; in fact, I get it. Even for me, it appeals for my want to become something greater than what I am now, or being part of something that is larger than life. But the problem is that beyond this - and the integration of Greek mythology into the novel - the merits of this book are sparse.

Bearing in mind that the target audience is for children to teenagers, the narrative is simplistic, and I am unsure if that is due to the limitations of the author or because Percy is a young adult with a teenage voice. But then again, even simple writing can be sophisticated, and lacks that sort of sophistication and refinery, or insight in the overarching ideas of the novel.

The primary failing of this novel, however, is the execution of the plot. If you detach the plot itself from how it was executed, then the story is decent. It's a children's book that has potential, especially because it is eventful and can be interesting. But the events of the novel felt disjointed and spliced together, like a compilation of 'mini adventures of the Lightning Thief' amalgamated into one book. Understandably the eventfulness of the book is to probably keep readers entertained, but when the events do not contribute to the story or are not completely meaningful in building towards the book's climax, then it feels very underwhelming and pointless in the end. For me, it felt like Riordan chose including an assortment of cool mythological creatures for the sake of 'coolness' over coherent storytelling. Essentially, is poorly written.

Furthermore - and many readers have already pointed this out - Percy may have 'challenges' but they aren't challenging, or else do not feel so. His successes are predictable and thus feel largely undeserved. The challenges that Percy faces are 'challenges' in terms of what a quest should have, but ultimately the quest taught him nothing about himself or did not challenge his development as a character - which is what a quest should ideally do for someone.

Also, a  gripe that I have with this book was that it had many eurocentric and Americentric undertones. The Western world is the greatest force in the world? The Olympian Gods are centred in America because it is the most powerful force? I won't even delve into the problems that sort of ideology has caused; these are the ideologies that uphold systems of oppression, justify imperialism and American supremacy. For that sort of ideology to seep into a children's book -- this sort of rhetoric has no place in children's books. Kids may not understand the impact that sort of thinking may impact the world, but it will impact how they perceive it. (Not to mention Chiron was extremely preachy about it too.)

To sum it up: is average. It's easy to read because of its simplistic narrative and characterization, but it makes no attempts to gauge or emotionally or mentally challenge its readers. It is escapism material with very little merits, though it has enough for it to be entertaining. Maybe is one of those books that you give to kids that don't like reading to ease them into the idea that reading Personally, had potential but it's lack of boldness, problematic undertones and poor plot execution left much to be desired.

20,2,"Hm... Maybe I need to stop seeing movies before I read the book. Here's another movie that I felt was better done than the book. The movie made some *major* plot changes that I felt filled in holes that were left in the book and streamlined a lot of overly long and complicated series of events.

There are a lot of events and explanations in this book that require a great deal of suspension of belief to swallow, even apart from the Greek god and monster parts. The author often relies on weak logic to tie it all together, and Percy is at times painfully slow and dim-witted. Perhaps this is an effort to make him seem like a typical 12-year-old boy, but he's also a demigod - so shouldn't he have a basic or even above-average level of intelligence?

Don't get me wrong - this is an easy, fun, entertaining read, and I liked being reminded of the Greek myths (since I haven't thought about that subject since high school). Mostly, though, the first book of this series left me nostalgic for the Harry Potter series. Same premise (young gifted black-haired 12-year-old boy goes to a special school for students with special powers, makes friends with a smart girl and a goofy, wisecracking male and goes on quests) - but J.K. Rowling is the far superior story teller. Still, I might read Book 2 in this series. We'll see."
21,2,"This was recommended to me by the 11 year old son of one of my best friends, so of course I had to read it! He's totally captivated by greek mythology, so I can see why he'd love this series so much.

The first book was a decent read, but truthfully, after reading Harry Potter, it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for another boy with special powers. Harry's hard to beat IMO.

That said, Riordan's done his homework, and has certainly made a good case for energizing greek mythology and injecting a modern twist to the old tales. I would imagine that young boys 9-13 would really like this series, and if it get's them to read, then I say bravo to Riordan."
22,2,I guess I will be writing a review once I watch the movie!
23,2,"2 Star's!!

This was okay, def for the younger audience. I don't have much else to say about it sooo....."
24,2,"Narration: The first person perspective brings unique challenges, especially for a children's book. Riordan fails entirely to surmount these challenges. The narrator goes from sounding way too smart and too interested in describing random crap one minute to being a complete dunce the next.

Plot: One of the things that makes a good children's book be an adult book as well is that you don't figure out too much in advance. If the author made the overarching plot any clearer he would have just put it on the first page, with all the excessive hints he gives to the main character (which, by the way, the main character ignores)

Character: Speaking of which, am I supposed to love these characters? Because I don't. They all come off as flat. Percy is an idiot who somehow lucks into pretty much everything. Is he not amazed by this world? Does he not want to explore his own powers when he starts to discover his control of water? I think the author forgot what it is like to be a kid. The girl is not memorable and has stereotypical female weakness forced upon her, and Grover is unsympathetic and boring.

Action: The action sequences are completely lacking. Why and how does Percy manage to just luck into win after win? Everything is simplistic, there is no depth and the escapes are all too easy. If Percy can do this, anyone can and its nothing special. And, how on earth do they manage to run into every ""monster"" known to man in one 10 day trip?

World Creation: Riordan goes out of his way to incorporate as much mythology as possible, but his world lacks a desirability that is needed in this type of book. The world he creates is so capricious and corrupt that I cannot see how any kid would want to enter it. I have to agree with the first few lines that, based on this book, its great I am not a half blood. Essentially, world, the magic, etc, lack fun, wonder, and whimsy. Also, there is distinctive moments where this seems to just rip imagery and ideas about how Gods would be on earth from Neil Gaiman's

Concept: This is a great concept. That is what makes the rest so sad. This could be such a GREAT world, and such interesting plotline and awesome action scenes, but its not. It just falls entirely flat."
25,2,"I am too old for this.

That, or it completely lacks the magic that other children's lit possesses. I just finished reading, for the first time, The City of Ember and I adored it. I completely went down the rabbit hole with that one. With Percy, I was just along for the ride and a little disenchanted by the whole thing. It didn't have the charm, the energy, the discovery or the wonder that books like Ember, Narnia, Alice in Wonderland, and The Indian in the Cupboard possess. These are my true, all-time favorite children's books that I can read again and again, as an 8-year-old or a 38-year-old (not quite there yet, but for argument's sake!) and probably again as a 68-year-old, and feel, once again, like a kid reading up in a treehouse, and not like an adult who's too old to be holding this book in her hands."
26,2,"Praticamente un rifacimento in salsa mitologica di Harry Potter e la pietra filosofale: le analogie tra le due saghe si sprecano e sono talmente evidenti da risultare irritanti.
Se almeno l'autore avesse affrontato l'erculea fatica della caratterizzazione dei protagonisti, anziché ricalcare per filo e per segno le personalità del trio di rowlingiana fattura, forse i suddetti non sembrerebbero delle macchiette piatte e incolori e questo libro sarebbe più digeribile.
Se gli dei dell'Olimpo mi concederanno l'ispirazione, leggerò il seguito: sia mai che faccia la sua entrata in scena l'originalità, questa sconosciuta."
27,2,"I had such high hopes, I heard about so much and expected to love it. I also love greek mythology, so that is double disappointment. But 2.5 stars, that's it. My daughter though, would not agree at all, she really liked it.

I didn't care about any of the characters, I wasn't excited about what happened to them, and found most of the book quite boring. I guess Rick Riordan really aimed to the juvenile readers, and seems that he succeeded with his goal.

The idea is creative and interesting. Sons of Greek gods in modern times. But, the situations they got into weren't interesting, and of course they overcame any obstacle too easily.

I would not continue reading this series. Completely unnecessary in my opinion. Almost 2.5 starts."
28,2,"Now, this was a fast read! I absolutely enjoyed this book. Fast-paced, lots of fun, great characters.. not to metion that it's a wonderful way to learn more about greek mythology (yes, I know, I should have studied all that stuff at school but you know.. it was school and not a Percy Jackson's book so..). I just can't wait for all the characters to grow up so that I can enjoy this books even more."
29,2,"America is now the heart of the flame. It is the great power of the West.
There's a tiny, easy-to-miss joke in the movie Team America: when cutting to an establishing shot outside the US, it will needlessly relate the foreign country's distance from America. That distance acts as a gauge for just how much Americans really need to care. Jokes about American egocentrism aren't a new, or terribly clever, observation, but when I read the above quote, I was reminded of it. ""Western civilisation"" is referenced too: the Greek-rebrand colonialists used to mythologise their own conquering of unknown territories. In terms of culture and history, America is barely out of its infancy. Since slaughtering the natives and their culture, only three centuries has elapsed. There are bridges and walls I walk past daily that are twice as old. ""The West,"" and ""Western civilisation"" are phrases that evoke societies rising and falling in isolation, as if the world hasn't always been interconnected. Besides that, its hilarious that the Greek gods operate under such a modern understanding of the West and its global geopolitics.

That WW2 is directly related to a 1v1 between gods is a choice, for instance.

The whole story could take place in America because Percy is American, but no, lets have a sermon about America's pre-eminence in a mythology literally named after a country that still exists.

I'm not sure how I feel about how disabilities are treated here. A wheelchair user turns out to be a not-fully-human mythological creature. And Percy's learning differences — ADHD and dyslexia — are othered too, as being a byproduct of his half-blood heritage. I've always been of the opinion that these kind of differences should be normalised rather than pedestaled in any particular way. Good or bad. That's not to discredit the value of these kinds of depictions exactly. I just think they're not as valuable in the long-term.

Other than that, Percy is a twelve-year-old that learns he's the offspring of Poseidon and is tasked with recovering Zeus's lightning bolt, presumably stashed away in the Underworld. The plot is a basic fetch quest, and I spent a lot of time noticing the unfortunate similarities to . To be clear: isn't terribly unique, at all, but with its cultural dominance, the similarities hurt . The age of the main characters, the friend group of a diligent girl and a somewhat luckless boy; both attending a school/camp to hone their extra-special-unique abilities; and the fact that the first instalment is heavy with thunderbolt imagery. Also, the titular item turns out to be in the main character's possessions at the end, unbeknownst to him. A fearsome enemy in Kronos, presumed dead, but lurking in the shadows. It's by no means plagiaristic — Riordan and Rowling draw from the same well, and by the time was published, was on its fifth instalment. It wouldn't have hurt to tweak it a bit more to stand out.

The description of Hades is something else:
Just in case the references to Hitler, Napoleon and, presumably, bin Laden didn't immediately convey Hades isn't a great guy.
Luke was an absolute treasure trove of observations like this. Poor guy just wants some half-decent quests. Sadly, it also does that thing where the end is expository monologuing to wrap up every conceivable loose end in the plot. It's just as bad here. I did enjoy the twist on Percy having to let his mother save herself, even if her character is an afterthought.

The world of is a roller-coaster of loosely connected action sequences and a lathering of Greek mythology. As it is, ticks all the right marketability boxes without distinguishing itself in an oversaturated genre of plucky chosen ones."

32,2,"I had heard of this fantasy series from a few people, saw it on bookshelves a few weeks ago and then caught a teaser trailer for the upcoming movie, so I decided to give it a whirl. The initial appeal was the juxtaposition of Greek myths with the real world, and the idea that the cosmos are actually being controlled by these colossal deities whose lives are defined by monsters, magic and mayhem. So I bought the first three books in a box-set and dove right in. Here is my verdict on the first book, The Lightning Thief:

As far as plot goes, it's impossible to avoid any comparisons to the Harry Potter franchise. A child has powers unknown to him and, when threatened by the forces of evil, is ushered to a far-away magical place for kids with similar powers only to find that he's destined for greatness. It's simple and familiar, but in author Rick Riordan's world it's not Midas' touch. For starters, Riordan doesn’t incorporate Greek myths into the modern world as much as he waters them down. : For example, Medusa owns a shop where she sells statues, Procrustes owns a bed emporium, Poseidon wears a Hawaiian beach shirt and Ares resembles a Hell’s Angel. : Greek myths are suppose to be larger than life; towering, often terrible creatures that rise above the lot of mortals, engraved forever in the pantheon of ancient human culture. Here, that status is turned into a series of gags, and not very good ones.

The book takes off instantaneously from page one, as if readers were to have the same ADHD that the protagonist has. The book moves at a breakneck speed and has very few moments of imaginative brilliance. With the amount of material for inspiration, I was expecting an abundance of visual experiences. The book, however, is shockingly short on eye candy. Furthermore, it is written in first-person and in the language of a snappy but dull 11-year old. The problem with this is that Riordan gives himself carte blanche on describing things as ""pretty cool"", “awesome” or “a surfer dude”, and describing every single object in terms of how tall or far away it is instead of giving us any sensory comparisons. But my biggest pet peeve is the chapters’ names: each one sounds like the title of a Bruce Coville novel, and though they aim to draw out some chuckles, they all fall painfully flat.

All of the above leads to one simple conclusion: the target audience for this series is a much younger demographic. I will, however, finish books two and three to see if this changes. Not only can you finish these books in an afternoon, but they do suggest that there might be a big payoff in the end. Here’s to hoping."
33,2,"2,5 en realidad

Bueno, en realidad pienso que este libro debería haberlo leído en otro momento, estuve en una reading slump que afectó todas mis lecturas y ésta no fue la excepción. La verdad me gustó (algo), es entretenido pero le encontré como muchas cosas que no me gustaron tanto.

Los personajes son tan irreales más allá de que la mayoría de ellos son criaturas mitológicas, dioses, etc etc... no tienen reacciones humanas en lo absoluto. Este libro es un Middle Grey, lo entiendo, pero creo que si el autor no sabe manejar una muerte en un libro middle grey no deberían haber muertes.

La realidad es que estoy como enojado con este libro porque no fue lo que pensé, no me hizo sentir lo que pensé mis expectativas no estuvieron cumplidas por la mitad.

Fue un libro lindo pero creo que tiene una bola de hype al rededor que te llenan de ganas de encontrarte con algo que la verdad en mi caso... no encontré.
Annabeth Chase mi personaje favorito.

Quiero agregar algo que no puedo dejar pasar. Todo el mundo compara con demasía la saga Magisterium con la saga Harry Potter... esas mismas personas ¿de verdad no encuentran semejanzas entre la saga de Percy Jackson y la de HP? Lo dejó ahí para no hacer muy largo todo el asunto.

Uno de los factores que me gustó mucho es la cantidad de contenido de la mitología griega que hay. Amo la mitología y en este libro ese asunto está muy bien logrado. I mean, el crossover de Mitología Griega con el siglo XXI está muuuuuy bien logrado.

En fin tengo un sabor agridulce con este libro, me gustó y al mismo tiempo no, por eso decidí darle la mitad de la calificación máxima.

Todavía no estoy seguro si planeo seguir con la saga."
34,2,"The witty Percy Jackson is a 13 year-old half-blood. A half blood is a demigod that has evil monsters trying to kill him. After being kicked out of his boarding school, Percy, his best friend Grover, a curly haired centaur, and Percy’s mother set out for Montauk, Long Island. Their friendly trip is soon interrupted though, when the three come face to face with The Minotaur. After a grueling fight with the Minotaur, Percy’s mother is dissolved into nothing and Percy and Grover are left to find their own way. Then, Grover, along with Annabeth and her father, take Percy to Camp Half Blood. This camp houses demigods on Long Island. Soon after Percy’s arrival, tragedy strikes Mount Olympus. The all-powerful and mighty Zeus’ master lightening bolt is stolen and the prime suspect is Percy Jackson. Percy has to find Zeus’ property and return it to him within ten days while Mt. Olympus is in a Civil War. Once Percy discovers the real robber, he has to meet his father who ran out on his mother, the father who wanted to send Percy to Camp Half Blood from the start. Later, he confronts the Oracle’s riddle, warning him of a fault in the loyalty of a friend, and he must prove to Zeus that he is not the culprit. The Lightening Thief is a phenomenal read for those who enjoy science fiction/fantasy novels. The book contains action, comedy, and suspense. Rick Riordan is a genius of suspense and thrill. The book seems to absorb the reader into Percy’s thoughts. The reader is beside the character in Riordan’s descriptive vocabulary and exhilarating events."
35,2,"I don't get why so many adults think these books are so great. I can maybe understand kids loving them, but discerning adult readers (like myself, ho ho)? I found many elements that had obviously been adapted from Harry Potter, but that wasn't what annoyed me, no, what did was the plot line. It was Percy and Co. blithely walking into one encounter with a Greek god after another, and each time, there would be an obvious air of menace about the diner/shop/theme park they're about to enter, and Percy would feel 'slightly uneasy' or that 'something wasn't right' and then EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. It was unbelievably frustrating to have the main character act so blindly.
So the story felt jerky and episodic, and I didn't appreciate the rather dumb sense of humour throughout. The next Harry Potter? I think not!"
36,2,"DNF. Things I liked: the empowerment of little boys who had been labeled ADD/dyslexic underachievers.

Things I didn't like: Pedantic, dumbed-down writing (even though it's a middle school boy book, that doesn't mean you have to put pages and pages of blatant, boring explication in the mouths of secondary characters)

The first two girls we meet are villains, and both are described as ""ugly,"" and one as fat.

""Most teachers are monsters""?! Great way to screw over your middle school boy readers.

2 stars."
37,2,"I'll have to try and review this later.

It just wasn't my cup of tea unfortunately. Didn't really connect to the characters and I found myself tuning it out, (audio version) I didn't even care enough to go back and listen to what I missed.

Do the characters get older through out the series like HP? Or do they stay this young forever. I think that might be part of the issue of not connecting is because of the age differences."
38,2,Ya sevmeyi çok istedim ama sevemedim... Muhtemelen ileride bir şans daha vereceğim ama şimdilik böyle oldu
39,2,This book is very disappointing
40,2,"Pues... un meh. No ha estado mal, se deja leer, pero tampoco ha tenido nada que me haya parecido diferente o especial.

**Alerta Spoiler!!

1.-La historia. Percy, un niño de 12 años, es atacado por los monstruos porque resulta que es el hijo de uno de los dioses Griegos. Para estar a salvo se refugia en el campamento mestizo, donde lo mandan a una misión, recuperar el rayo de Zeus que ha sido robado por alguien que desea desatar la tercera guerra mundial.

2.-Los personajes. Percy, no está mal, tiene unos puntos de humor bastante buenos, lo que pasa es que luego resulta que tiene 12 años y no te crees parte de su comportamiento. Mejor imaginar como que tiene de 15 para arriba.
Grover, el sátiro que siempre va perdiendo los pies, es el graciosillo de la panda y es un compañero agradable.
Annabeth, la hija de Atenea, la inteligente del grupo.
Luego están los dioses que son como niños grandes, caprichosos, irascibles, egoístas...
La madre, que es un amor, y el imbécil del padrastro.
Y poco más se pude decir porque no es que haya mucho desarrollo ni trasfondo en los personajes.

3.-La pluma, la trama y demás. Es un libro con una trama ágil en la que no dejan de pasar cosas, y que va desvelando poco a poco la información que le interesa. Los capítulos son cortos y es agradable la forma en la que la mitología se integra con el mundo actual, pero hay cosas que son un poco de poner los ojos en blanco. Lo malo es que los personajes son niños que no actúan como niños. Es difícil imaginárselos con 12 años y no con 15 o 16 y eso le resta.

4.-El final. Bien. Ata los cabos, cierra lo que tiene que cerrar, y te deja sabiendo que la historia no ha hecho más que comenzar.

En fin 2,5 estrellas sobre 5 que se quedan en 2 porque sé que es un libro que ni siquiera leyéndolo unos cuantos años antes, hubiera conseguido hacerme pensar que era ""genial"" o ""espectacular"".

**Popsugar 2021 categoría 39. Un libro que parece haber leído todo el mundo excepto tú."
41,2,"Want to sign up for the greek Mythology class? you have come to the right place. The book seemed illogical and inconsistent at various places. The narrator is a twelve-year kid, who saw his mother almost die in front of him, do you think he would go around sounding so brave and cracking miserable jokes? Sometimes that boy is dyslexic and sometimes not.

The book had been over-explained, and not sure why, but again and again it has been made clear that any ugly or fat, or masculine girl is evil. Listening to opera has been compared to walking naked on a cactus farm. What's with the idea that America is the center of Western Civilisation and George Washinton is the son of Athena. The book was very much with the use of and greek Mythology jammed into it whenever the author got a chance.

I had such high hopes for pjo series but it failed me terribly, maybe I was not the target audience. Halfway into the book, I was basically dragging myself just to complete it anyhow. For kids it might be good but definitely wouldn't recommend it to any adult or even not to teenagers, there are great books out there, reading it just for knowing a little bit of pjo series is fine but don't get your hopes high."
42,2,"La lectura es muy ligera, Percy se me hace uno de los personajes más insufribles que he leído.

No lo soporté, de no ser lectura conjunta creo que lo hubiese abandonado. Lo terminé en un 24 hrs leyendo porque ya no soportaba al personaje.

Espero que la saga mejore. Este primer libro, me gustó la mención que hace a los mitos griegos y los personajes de Annabeth y Grover, pero creo que es lo único rescatable."
43,2,"2.5 stars

I didn’t really care for the series. The characters were fine. The plot was fine. The world building was fine. I thought that the underworld was interesting but i didn’t care about the camps. Part of the story it started sticking to a certain formula. Find a monster, fight it and move on. It got kinda boring. I didn’t really care about the quest or the gods. Nothing really stuck with me.

I did like that the main character was dyslexic and had ADHD. You don’t see that many characters especially in middle grade that is dyslexic."
44,2,"There seemed to be two different camps of thought when I read other reviews of The Lightning Thief, and they have very little common ground:

“Percy Jackson and the Olympians has a modern, hip, even urban style that people weary of Harry's earnest heroism may actually PREFER.” – “Like a Hipper Harry Potter” Amazon Review by bensmomma

“Maybe if you're aged between eight and 12, or exceptionally dim-witted, you may not notice that this is a tenth-rate rip-off of Harry Potter, with Greek mythology taking the place of magic.” - Chris Tookey

I am not as militant about it as Mr. Tookey, but I definitely do dub it “Potter Light”. As I was reading, I kept thinking about ninth grade English, where we analyzed West Side Story and how it was really a modern retelling of Romeo & Juliet. (The Nurse and Anita give the same advice, i.e. “stay away from that boy”, in the exact same act, etc.) However, you don’t need a class or to comb through either series for minor details to make the connection. The similarities are pretty hard to miss:

Percy has grown up with strange things happening to him throughout his life that he doesn’t understand. In sixth grade, he learns he is special and charged with saving the world in a prophecy, where he’s even also called “the one.” While at Camp Half Blood (Hogwarts) students are placed into tents by gods (not unlike the houses via sorting hat) and there are competitions between these groups to capture their flag (Quidditch). He has two sidekicks, one of which is a girl who is the brains of the trio. Chiron the centaur provides the sage advice (Dumbledore) to the young boy. He has a horrible step-dad Gabe (who is much like the Dursley’s) and discovers more about his parentage throughout the story. To get to Mount Olympus, you take the elevator to a floor that doesn’t exist in the Empire State Building, much like the 9 ¾ train platform to Hogwarts. So, while there are Gods and Goddesses instead of witches and wizards, basically the plot reads much like Harry Potter as a Mad Libs exercise.

However, this was not the worst part for me.

Most frustrating for me was how the plot is peppered with incredibly fortunate coincidences...you know, JUST when the characters need them. In Harry Potter, these lucky breaks are rarer and, more importantly, explained. For example, Dobby is able to disapparate in and out of Hogwarts, as well as the death eater’s basement to save Harry and his crew in The Deathly Hallows, because he is an elf. Voldemort considers elves beneath him, and therefore wouldn’t have thought of powers they have that wizards don’t, which is why they are able to escape. In contrast, Percy and his group were hungry, and a mysterious five-star hotel appears. They are given a credit card with an infinity symbol on the limit. They get to eat, shower, play for a while, and then take a taxi the rest of the way. No explanations or reveal of the characterization behind it. Just...Ta Da.

Also, it’s less offensive to me, but I’ll also note how the casual slang does not read as refreshingly “urban” as some credit it to be. More like a Caucasian forty-six-year-old who is trying very hard to sound “urban”. (Oh, wait…)

All that said, it still is a fast-paced action novel with the same timeless themes of good versus evil, and there is a reason why they work so well in HP. Young adolescents can definitely identify with Percy, his A.D.H.D. and dyslexia diagnoses, and his frustration with constantly being blamed for things he didn’t do. The Lightning Thief is entertaining and an easy read. It certainly never taxes one with obscure symbolism or requiring pondering analysis. It’s fun for what it is.

Bottom line? Is Rick Riordan ground chuck to J.K. Rowling’s tenderloin steak? Absolutely. Still, there’s nothing wrong with enjoying an occasional cheeseburger. Just know that’s what you’re ordering."
45,2,well that was dumb. can't believe i had to read this for school...
46,2,"Mi sono avvicinato a questo libro senza pretese e senza aspettative.
Immaginavo fosse una mezza cavolata scritta cavalcando l’onda lunga di Harry Potter, allontanandosi dalla magia e tirando invece in ballo la mitologia greca (idea affatto malvagia, anzi!, e che offre innumerevoli spunti…) ma speravo di venire contraddetto.
L’aver trovato in offerta il libro a meno di due euro mi ha aiutato a decidere di dargli una possibilità.

Purtroppo però mi sono ritrovato a confermare le impressioni iniziali.
L’idea di fondo è buona, o almeno lo potrebbe essere (gli Dèi esistono, non sono mai scomparsi, solo che non sono più in Grecia ma si sono spostati con l’Olimpo in America, visto che restano dov’è la civiltà occidentale… solo che ora cercano di dare meno nell’occhio. E continuano a copulare come conigli con i mortali, da cui il fiorire di mezzidei che i mostri amano cacciare e uccidere prima che questi crescano abbastanza da venire riconosciuti, individuati, addestrati e usati per cacciare mostri leggendari). E il ritmo dell’avventura non è malaccio, c’è abbastanza azione da non fare addormentare il lettore e da condurlo rapidamente alle pagine finali.
Questo però, per quanto mi riguarda, è tutto quello che ho trovato di buono nel libro.

Perché posso sorvolare sulla banalità e sulla prevedibilità della storia, posso passare sopra al fatto che il giovane Percy che studia i più oscuri miti ed eroi dell’antica Grecia non riconosca le Norne al chioschetto lungo la strada… ma l’assenza di introspezione psicologica (arrivato in fondo al libro ancora non so che carattere abbia Percy, a parte che vuole bene alla mamma e odia il patrigno, ed è amico del satiro Grover) no, non la posso ignorare.
Come non posso trascurare il fatto che la storia, raccontata in prima persona da Percy fin dal titolo dei capitoli, non mi entusiasmi per niente, anzi tenda ad allontanarmi dal libro.



No, francamente penso che per quanto mi riguarda l’incontro con Percy Jackson finisce qui…"
47,2,"I did not enjoy this book! I thought it had a creative plot (half-blood greek god children living in today's world), but I just didn't think the writing was all that great. The thing that bugged me the most was that the character development was lacking. The characters weren't fleshed out very much so I didn't become attached to them. In fact, you don't even find out what the main character, Percy, looks like until like the last chapter. I also thought the dialogue was extremely cheesy and fake. It was appropriate for the characters to use teenager slang and such, but like I said, it was cheesy and fake. And finally, a small thing, but there was a TYPO in this book! I know most people would have read over this without even noticing, but I notice little things like this... on page 231 it says, ""She snatched an entire row of stuff of the racks and disappeared into the changing room."" (Should be stuff OFF the racks) Okay, sorry for slamming this book, I was just disappointed with it. It's obvious that there are going to be sequels to this book, but I'm not really interested in reading them. I did really like all of the references to greek gods and myths, though. It made me want to go read more about that! I loved learning about that in middle school."
48,2,"The one where Percy discovers that he has something a little more serious than ADHD and a bad school record: He actually has a destiny from his father, a Greek god.

I read this only semi-voluntarily; my mother had gotten it for my nine-year-old, and then begun to worry that it might have something inappropriate in it. If I hadn't been providing parental supervision, I wouldn't have finished it.

The chapter titles are marvelous (""In Which I Accidentally Vaporize My Pre-Algebra Teacher""), but that sense of humor isn't evident anywhere else. And -- look, I'm certainly not going to say that 's character-building and world-building are flawless, but they're There's more happening in the small corners of one chapter of Harry Potter than in this entire book.

The characters are flat collections of motivation+conflict with no eccentricities. The world is as thin as a stage set; there's nothing there that doesn't serve a purpose, nothing that's been tossed in just from the sheer joy of creation.

For the record, I didn't find anything I considered inappropriate for a nine-year-old. I just thought it was boring."
49,2,"Kids these days! They are obsessed with this series, but I mostly just found the opening volume flat and dull. The Harry Potter comparison is the obvious one to make, and as several other reviewers have pointed out: even at J.K. Rowling’s CAPSLOCKY worst, her books are bursting with more imagination and world-building on a single page than Riordan manages in his entire tale. The M.O. of this story seems to be “demigod preteens go somewhere, something mythological shows up.” These cameos aren’t particularly imaginative or revealing—Medusa has a fruit stand/roadside shop with a statue garden! Blah blah—nor are the main characters dynamic enough to make me really care. So it’s not bad—it’s just . Okay, fine—I can keep showing kids where we keep the series in the shop; I don’t have to read it."
50,2,"I could see that Rick Riordan had a bud of potential when he struggled to write this book. But as soon as I got into it, Riordan stomped on that bud and ripped those roots out of the ground in a flash. Don't get me wrong, this book has humor, suspense, adventure, etc. But the author laid everything out flat, thinking that kids wouldn't be smart enough to look over the hills. Some children are actually capable of inference and context clues. (I know! Shocker!)
Another thing, either I'm an old, blind, dumb man or there was no character development for Percy whatsoever. Maybe he grew without my mind comprehending it. But Percy seemed like the same loser who happened to gain some friends along the way. That bothers me. Character development is critical if you want the reader to relate with the character better. Humans learn from their mistakes. Learning=changing. I expected Percy to change in the next book, Sea of Monsters. As far as I could tell he hadn't changed one bit.
Overall this book wasn't too terrible. I did expect a little more from the author but it's okay."
51,2,"My siblings had been recommending this series for a while, so I decided to give the first book a chance. It was about this boy (Percy) who discovered that his life was pretty weird. After a couple of really weird things happened to him, he was sent off to a demigod boot camp! He gets sent off on a quest and the rest of the book is about that quest. I personally didn't really enjoy the book just because imaginary things aren't my favorite genre, and when I read books, I like to be able to imagine exactly what everything in the book looks like and this book made that pretty hard. I won't be reading the rest of the books, but at least I gave it a try. The author is really talented with these types of books, and I'm not saying the book is bad, it just doesn't interest me."
52,2,"A lot of people ask me why I don’t like this book, since kids love them, so I decided to leave a review.

First, I think the main qualification of being a high quality young adult or children’s work of literature, is the book needs to still be enjoyable and appealing to adults. If your main goal in reading is page-turning, adrenaline rushes, this book might appeal to you - for the first 3-4 chapters - until you realize that almost every chapter repeats itself in the same sequence and then becomes gruelingly predictable: main character encounters a weird person, weird person turns out to be a bad guy, bad guy tries to kill him, main character narrowly escapes death, and repeat ...

There is no depth here. Minimal character development. No real moral lesson. In short: it’s twaddle."
53,2,"While it steals from the Classics, this will never be a classic. This is a thoroughly mediocre book. The underlying idea is good enough - a modern day revisiting of Greek myths. The first person perspective could be an interesting choice. However, the incredibly unoriginal treatment steals significantly from the Harry Potter series then adds large chunks of silly pop culture references that will make this book seem dated in a couple of years. The juvenile sense of ""humor"" also drags this book down. This is a flavor of the month that will fade away just like the disposable Top 40 hits it mentions."
54,2,"Alright. So, I have read this before but I decided to give the series another try. Still not liking it. Don't like the characters, the action was so random and unimportant. Percy was stupid and uninteresting. Annabeth was unlovable. She didn't have a personality outside of rude and blah. Grover, however, was likable. I too eat when I am stressed. The action came at random spots and barely seemed to contribute to the story. All in all, this really wasn't a good book. I'm going to try and finish the series, but I don't know if I will be able to make it."
55,2,"While I genuinely like greek mythology and everything that surrounds it, this book was a bit hard for me to get through. Perhaps because I am not the exact target audience, but alas. I liked the book and I will certainly continue reading the series. Just hoping that i'll like the rest a little bit more."
56,2,"I had such a rough time with this book. It was too cheesy for me, I am blown away by how much kids love it- and that's really all that matters. It made a fabulous tween program and now I know enough to do a good recommendation to a kid."

62,2,"Look, I do my star ratings by how much I enjoyed the book, not as a measure of its objective worth, so don't come for me. This is obviously a your mileage may vary scenario. But I really, really didn't enjoy reading this book. I struggle with first person perspective at the best of times and I just didn't like being in Percy's head. Also, the whole ""old, ugly woman = evil monster"" trope got old really quickly. If this hadn't been a bookclub pick I would have DNFed quite early on. Ah well, can't enjoy them all."
63,2,"This was lost on me, it was just ok. Mostly, I was put off by the portrayal of disability and the awful language they used to describe it: weak, powerless, crippled, stupid, wheelchair bound, but wait, just kidding - they’re not disabled, the disability is fake to hide their magical skills. It’s so over played. This was flagged as notable to me because Percy has ADHD and a learning disability, but even that is just hidden magical whatever. Why couldn’t they be magical, powerful, and disabled? This doesn’t promote acceptance, it’s just ablest nonsense."

STORY BRIEF:
Percy is dyslexic with ADHD. His mother raised him alone. He doesn’t know who his biological father is. Odd things have happened to him but he never questioned them. At age eleven a minotaur attacks Percy and his mother causing the mother to disappear. Percy ends up at Camp Half Blood where he discovers that he is a godling (child of a Greek god father and a human mother). The other kids there are also godlings. Each child has talents and skills relating to their Greek god parent. As godlings age they have stronger vibes which draws monsters to attack them.

Someone has stolen Zeus’ master lightning bolt. Percy is selected to go on a quest to get it and return it to Zeus to avoid a war among the gods. Grover and Annabeth accompany Percy. They are given some magic objects to help them, for example a hat that makes one invisible, and a pen that turns into a magic sword. As they travel to get the bolt, monsters attack them on a regular basis.

REVIEWER’S OPINION:
This book is extremely similar to the Harry Potter stories - just change wizards to godlings. I loved the Harry Potter books, but when I read this book I was bored. But I could see reading it to a child under the age of eleven. The main character Percy is a little slow and doesn’t figure things out very quickly. So I could see a child guess things before Percy does and feel good about it. But I haven’t read it to a child, so I’m not sure about this.

It reminded me of children’s computer games where the character is on a quest. To solve the problem the character must travel to different locations and do tasks to get trinkets. When they get all the right trinkets the problem is solved and they get the main prize. But it was missing the character development, depth, and creativity that Harry Potter had. It was mostly kids on a journey and when fighting a monster they’d yell at each other “run.”

Throughout the journey Percy gets clues in the form of riddles. The oracle tells him where to go, and then tells him he won’t succeed with part of it but doesn’t explain. Later another fantasy creature tells Percy something that helps but also creates some unknown. These sources are supposed to be helping Percy, but they give him riddles to be solved. What kind of help is that? Why don’t they just tell him what they know? But that is me. To a young child it’s probably fine. I do not recommend it for teens and young adults. But it’s better than nothing, so if interested they might try the first book from the library and see how they feel.

Yes, there were riddles in the Harry Potter books, but they didn’t bother me the way the riddles here did. Riddles can be fine. I’m not against riddles. I think it had something to do with other things in the story not working for me.

It’s told in first person by Percy which did not appeal to me. He sounded like a typical contemporary eleven-year old using slang such as “that sucks” and “wwwwwhatever.” I didn’t care for the narrator, but that was personal preference. I kept wondering what his accent was. He said bit, ind, and ixactly (instead of but, and, and exactly – the generic TV speak which I’m used to).

76,2,"- Letture per il nipotame -
Il problema non è tanto il suo essere derivativo (Harry, Hermione & Ron go to the summer camp + American Gods for children + Saint Seiya).
Il problema è che fa veramente poco per nasconderlo, e che Riordan non ha lo stile piacevolissimo della Rowling (o i traduttori sono meno dotati, in questo caso non vedo nulla che possa spingermi a leggere l'originale).

Punto a suo favore, ed è un grosso punto, l'interesse che può facilmente generare verso la mitologia greca. Ma, a pensarci bene, sarebbe bastata Pollon..."
77,2,"Wanted to give this book another try after hearing repeatedly how much better the series and the author's works in general get when it comes to diversity later on. And I enjoyed myself enough this time around to give it a second star, mostly because the three main characters are so likeable and fun to read about (Percy himself took a while to grow on me, but he did).

In addition to my complaints mentioned in the original review below, what also bothered me this time were some rather... unfortunate... phrasing (""crippled"", ""wheelchair-bound"" (for a character who is also just
), describing darker skin as ""chocolate"" etc.) and the repetitiveness of the plot in the middle part of the book where the protagonists stumbled from one short encounter with a mythological beast to the next short encounter with a mythological beast with little to set them apart.

I did, however, really like one bit near the very end, namely that
, which is much more than I had expected from this book at this point.

Original review from March 2014 (1 star):

It's not a book I suppose, but even after 45% (or whatever the equivalent is in page numbers) there's just nothing there to keep me interested and more than a few things that annoy me to no end. From the little bits that I chalk up to personal preference (like me being driven up the wall by the ""America is so amazing, it's the True Heart of the West"" explanation for why this story about Greek gods in modern times takes place in the US instead of, oh, I dunno, Greece) to other bits such as there being a grand total of one sympathetic female character in the first half of the book who doesn't get fridged. Add to that that the narrative structure doesn't appeal to me and I have to wonder why I even read this far. (I blame the chapter titles. Those are kinda fun.)

Other things I didn't like:
- the narrative voice. Percy-the-narrator sounded less like a kid telling us his story and more like a middle-aged man desperately trying to sound like a kid telling us his story. I read Animorphs ffs and I still can't put up with this.

- the utter predictability of it all. And before someone says anything, yes of course I know this is a kids book. I read plenty of those that manage to pull what are essentially predictable plots off with more elegance.

I've heard that the series gets better later on, but the thing is, at this point I just don't care.
Oh well. Lots of other fish in this sea of books."

79,2,"Gostei das tramas envolvendo os deuses, bem novelão mexicano, mas acho que já tô velho pra acompanhar a jornada do Percy. Não consegui me envolver :("
80,2,"This was a thoroughly irritating reading experience for me. I was literally gritting my teeth at points, which is particularly disappointing because I came in expecting to enjoy myself.

The concept is so promising (I love me some modern twists on mythology) and I've been meaning to read it for quite some time. But within the first chapter I knew that me and this book were going to have problems. Most notably because of Percy's narrative voice.

First person narration can be used to great effect but it takes significant talent, particularly when the narrator is a child. But throughout this book Percy's voice never felt authentic let alone likeable. Every joke cracked and most every thought Percy has felt as if it had first been forced through a ""Kids are dumb right?"" meat grinder. Annabeth (poor man's Hermione) and Grover (even poorer man's Ron) each possess a single motivation and otherwise felt flat.

I know I sound like a curmudgeon, and this book did make me feel like a joyless old man at times. But many of my favourite books (and many of the books I read to this day) are classified as YA/childrens literature. Having an intended audience is no excuse to treat the reader like a moron. There is a line between writing for children and writing AT children (ie. catering) and this book crosses/pole-vaults over it.

What's worse is that because I was forced into Percy's head I became painfully aware of the fact that Percy NEVER REACTS APPROPRIATELY TO ANYTHING! Every single situation, from near death experiences to the apparent deaths of those close to him, feeds through Percy's demi-god brain with a levity that never stopped pissing me off. I will admit that I shouted at Percy several times.

None of this was helped by the fact that I listened to the book and the audiobook narrator made a number of performance choices that grated on my nerves. But I still place the majority of the blame for my woes on the writing of Mr.Rick Riordan.

If you're looking for an unfailingly pleasant romp of a read, or you're willing to overlook a lot for the sake of the cool premise, go ahead. But I went in with those thoughts in mind and was still repeatedly frustrated."
81,2,"★★☆☆☆ / 2

The first thing that came to my mind while reading this was: “I would have loved this so much if I was a kid”.

And that was my whole experience in a nutshell with this book.

Percy Jackson was entertaining, funny and easy to read, and that’s it. I’m an avid reader since I was very young but I managed to skip reading “classics” like , , etc… And that applies to Percy Jackson’s books.

Despite not being the biggest fan of Harry Potter, I liked them a lot more than this one.

But, I must say, my biggest problem was another. I didn’t really remember much about the movie,

I get it, they sell you the Gods move around the world, and it could make sense, but WHY everything is in the United States? Am I really the only one who was extremely irked about this?

In my mind I couldn’t stop picturing this scenario in which I would write about other country mythology, like Japan, Russia… and just say I feel like I would have been heavily criticized?

I just couldn’t shake the feeling and it bothered me all the book."
82,2,"2.5 stars - The writing was good and it's not a bad story, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. It's very clear that it's a book for middle grade boys. I couldn't find any character I could relate to, and it's definitely a very action-driven story rather than character-driven, which is what I like. It was just one event after the other, and I never got emotionally invested or cared. I listened to it as an audiobook and might have even DNF'ed it but didn't have anything better to listen to. The narrator, Jesse Bernstein, was amazing though and I wouldn't mind listening to other stuff by him (but looking on Audible, he hasn't narrated any other book that I'm interested in, sadly).

I do LOVE that we get a book with a main character who has ADHD.

I won't be continuing with the series, but I may watch the movie.

Just a few random notes:
- I didn't like the depiction of Ares. Just the way the narrator voiced him and the way he kept calling Percy ""punk,"" I felt like he was just a random biker dude... and that's exactly the way the author ended up describing him. I feel like Wonder Woman had a much better depiction of Ares (but of course, the Wonder Woman movie came out like 12 years after this book was published). I just couldn't take Ares seriously for most of it.
- Why would Dionysus, a ~god~, spend a year teaching at a middle school just to keep an eye on Percy? I don't get it. You'd think ~gods~ have better things to do, but then again, I guess that's one of my bigger problems with the entire book.
- Slightly unbelievable that three pre-teens could travel cross-country from NY to CA all by themselves. (Given, Grover is 25 but like a 12 year old? That's another problem. We have a 25 year old friends with a 12 year old.)
- And more I can't remember right now."
83,2,"I can't say that it's amazing nor lousy. So I think I'll have to settle into so-so

I tried hard not to think of Harry Potter while reading but I can't help it.. the similarity is just overwhelming. That I had to repeatedly remind and correct myself that the heroes name were Percy, Annabeth and Grover, not Harry, Hermoine and Ron respectively. And that they were divided according to their cabins and who's their parents are and not into houses or their ability. and most annoyingly that it is , not . It is a place not !

Even Percy's appearance, hello, black hair? Green eyes? I'm pretty certain I already met someone with the same descriptions but under a different name, in different pages of a different book penned by a different author. Sigh.

Percy Jackson and the Olympians and Harry Potter. Different books but the story is startlingly the same.

But what it failed to capture is the magic the boy wizard had cast to it's readers, or to me, for all I can remember from this book is it's just a great copy of a story I had grown to loved. i guess if i read this before HP i might have a different reaction/reception to this book, after all, it was a fun and quick read. HP was just better.

X'cess: while reading I had imagine Daniel, Emma and Rupert as the three leads. Lol. Even imagined Cerberus as Fluffy."
84,2,"SO . . . I would have given this book a 3 star BUT all the talk about marriage not being important brought my rating down to a 2 star. I know, I'm a total prude -- but seriously!! I was really bothered by this conversation:

Percy ""I thought she was married to somebody""
Grover ""What's your point?""
Percy ""So they have a thing going""
Annabeth ""That's old gossip Percy""
Percy ""What about Aphrodite's husband?""
Annabeth "". . . well he isn't exactly handsome. Clever with his hands, and all, but Aphrodite isn't into brains and talent, you know?""

This is just one of many examples that really bothered me as a Christian mother who believes in complete fidelity in marriage. Not to mention that ALL of the children are conceived in this book by one of the God's sleeping with Girl/Boyfriends and not committing to the relationship. And then there is Percy's mother who got married ONLY to protect her son, not because she cared for his step dad at all. I know that all of you are probably rolling our eyes at my review but I just couldn't get over this attack on marriage. I STONGLEY feel that there are soooooooooooo many other books that teach values that are worth reading about.

Aside from the attack on marriage in this book I felt this book was subpar. I was not impressed with the story line and there were only a few pages where I was draw in (mostly the high action parts of the story line)."
85,2,"I can't say that I had high hopes for The Lightning Thief, but I was expecting something mildly entertaining that I could hand a pre-teen without any qualms. I chose to listen to the audiobook, and ended up putting it aside about halfway through.

The Plot: Percy gets in trouble at school. A lot. Percy gets attacked by an evil school teacher and defeats her with a pen-sword. Percy gets attacked by a minotaur and defeats him with his own horn. Percy finds out he's the son of one of the Greek gods. Percy has some emotional issues with this. Percy finds out Zeus's thunderbolt has been stolen and it must be returned or VERY BAD THINGS will happen. Percy (who is twelve, btw) is sent to find the lighting bolt by a bunch of adults who think it's a great idea to send a kid to do something they can't. Danger, explosions, drama, etc, etc, win, YAY.

Pro: It was better than the movie.
Con: The movie was really, really terrible.
Pro: Percy's devotion to his mother is both admirable and touching.
Con: Percy is the most obnoxious young character I have read in a long time.
Pro: The Greek gods are cool!
Con: Well, they used to be. Riordan's version leaves them flat and utterly uncompelling.

While I can see why young readers would enjoy this novel, I can't say that I recommend it."
86,2,"Considering that I'll read anything that has anything to do with Greek mythology, it wasn't going to take me long to get around to reading this.

A fast-paced run through the pantheon of the gods and other mythic characters, dealing as it does with Percy - half-blood son of one of the big three (although it's staggeringly obvious who's son he is, I won't be mean and spoiler for any of those who haven't yet read it) as he discovers who he is and is sent on a quest to retrieve Zeus' stolen thunderbolt.

You can definitely tell that this is a book intended for young adults and the humour and writing style employed would be a good way of engaging with most young teenagers, but it all felt a little too superficial for me, and the way things were quickly encountered, despatched and then straight off to the next felt a little like the book itself had attention deficit disorder. That said, I did enjoy some of the incarnations of the gods, and trying to guess who was up next.

Great for teenagers, but I won't be concerning myself with reading any of the follow ups."
87,2,"Not very good.

This series is quite popular, but the first book was not very edifying. Positively, it gets you to hate evil, whether you find it in gods or mortals. The bad guys are really bad. You learn about the Greek gods in an entertaining way. It throws in lots of info about Greek mythology, actually bringing the whole story into modern day New York.

It brings the worldview, too. Gods are just stronger and bigger flawed humans. They fight each other so nothing is for sure in life, with their arbitrary plans always changing. Humans are pawns of the gods.

It's one thing to study this worldview, but another to assume its truth personally while identifying with the main character living it. Maybe helpful in an Ecclesiastes kind of way: experience how chaotic and uncertain life must feel for atheists or polytheistic pagans. No sure anchor.

Nah. Lots of better reading out there."

89,2,"I liked this book alot. The concept was fantastic, and it's probably one of the only fantasy books i like. However, i think it could have been executed better. The story was fun, fast paced, and exciting, but i thought some of the ideas were silly and/or offensive. It feels to my like it implys that dyslexics are dyslexic because they are semi-immortal people who are being hunted down by monsters. It insults people with dyslexia and ADHD. At least, it feels like that to me. The chapter titles are FANTASTIC, the speech is funny, and the ideas are great, but it's just not perfect. I would easly recommend this book to anybody.

EDIT: 5 years or so later I'm keeping this review up since its seemingly the only in-depth review I've ever written AND I love the fact that I was totally calling out casual ableism in 8th grade"
90,2,"Some young adult books appeal to both kids and adults, some should just be read by kids. I think this one falls into the latter category. It was definitely action packed, but I was bored by most of the action. I wanted character development and deeper moral questions. The jokes felt cheap and forced to me, but I could imagine my nieces reading them and cracking up. I was also annoyed by the way it seemed to copy the Harry Potter series and annoyed that Percy continually mentioned his dyslexia and ADHD even in the midst of battling monsters and gods. But at the same time I can see that its a good book to appeal to kids and teach them Greek mythology.

Thanks to my niece Sofie for lending me her copy of this book. Don't worry Sofie, I didn't lose your page!"
91,2,"My 9-yr-old nephew loved this series, and as I was reading it I could understand why. There's plenty of action and adventure, and the pacing jumps from action to action. As an adult, I did find it mildly entertaining, but I also found my mind drifting. For me, action on its own is too shallow. I need character development and relationships that evolve. I need characters who think a little bit. As a child, I enjoyed books that included those aspects as well, though, so I don't believe it's just that I've grown up. I never was a boy, so maybe that's it.

I did try starting the second book, but the action took right off again and I realized that I just wasn't interested enough. It made me tired."
92,2,"As much as I love Greek mythology themed books I didn't like this book as much as I thought. I had really high expectations because almost everyone loves these books and I've heard nothing but great things and well for me I didn't really like it. I did find it interesting and different & the storytelling was great but for some reason I didn't connect to the book. Maybe because the writing was just a little too simple for me and youngish. I don't think I will be continuing on with the series, I just don't see the point in continuing if I didn't love it. I just think this book was a little to young for me, I don't know, I am an old soul, so. And I am actually mad at myself that I didn't like it as much as I'd hoped. But I do see why people like this series, I guess it's just not for me."
93,2,"Hace bastante tiempo tenía ganas de leer éste libro porque siempre lo comparan con Harry Potter y soy muy fan de esa saga.
Ahora por fin lo terminé de leer y creo que esperaba más de este primer libro.
De todas formas me gustó porque se aprende bastante de mitología y además, me incentivó a buscar más información por mi cuenta. También es bastante gracioso, cosa que lo hacía menos denso por momentos porque me costaba muchísimo seguir con la lectura y no dejarlo.
Lo que sí, terminé antes ""Las pruebas de Apolo"" (aunque digan que no es recomendable por los spoilers, ya sé, ya sé..) me gustó mucho más que ""El ladrón del rayo"" y creo que es la única razón por la que voy a seguir leyendo estos libros..."
94,2,"I didn't really like this book, i think that the movie is better. The characters were good, but i think the real reason that i didn't like this book too much was because it was recommended for 12 year old boys, and for starters, i'm a girl, and i'm older than 12. So i think i might have enjoyed it better if i read them younger, but...
It was sooooo different from the movie, that i'm not even going to start. i think, like, two of the things were the same, but anyway. The directers from the movie had a different (And in my opinion, better.) idea for the story.


I recommend this book for people who liked the Harry Potter series, Teen Fantasy fiction and Greek gods."
95,2,"Note: I'd rather give this a 2.5 star rating, but that's not an option.

So, Percy Jackson. I made the mistake of reading this and expecting something, well, more mature and complex. Was it dramatic and surprising? No. Was it cute and funny? Yes.

I think, in order to fully grasp this book, one must approach it as it is, or read it while they are young. I was searching for epic plot-depth and mega character-development, but that's not this book. And that's okay.

The best part of the book? Percy and his mother's love of blue food. That stuck with me. I made blue chocolate-chip cookies, and they were fabulous.

Rating: PG"
96,2,"I can't say I read the book completely since I was reading a page and skipping the next 10, but oh well. I'm not a fantasy book fan therefore this was one of the most boring books I've read. I don't like the concept of unrealistic stuff such as dragons, and super powered gods. It has been recommended for me many times, so I thought I should give it another try. I tried reading as much as possible because it's not fair to give my review on it without reading the whole book, but I have failed. I should never attempt to read fantasy again."
97,2,"I was so disappointed by how little I felt for this book. I may have enjoyed it more if I read it first when I was younger, but when I read it I couldn't get past what felt like underdeveloped characters. They weren't even necessarily underdeveloped, but there was an emotional complexity I found very lacking. Now, I understand this book is for children, but I still found some of the writing felt too empty and was missing depth. A lot of the lines in the book struck me as unoriginal. The storyline was interesting, but the execution failed to captivate me."
98,2,"The first book in the Percy Jackson series is a fast moving, action packed YA novel that makes for some fun reading. I read it at the same time as my daughter (I like to read what she is reading), and it does have some great moments. Even though I know it's a fantasy novel, I had a hard time getting into a world in which the Greek gods are a reality and that there a large numbers of demigods running around because they keep having children. It was a fun, quick read though."
99,2,"A fun first installment in a series I'm only just getting around to! I don't really love urban fantasy/low fantasy, but this was innocent and charming enough that I'll read on in the series. I like the naive, earnest nature of the characters and enjoyed the way that mythology was woven into the story. Definitely rough on the writing and plotting aspects but I'm hoping it'll improve with the next book."
100,2,"Okej nej. Denna förstår jag inte. Två pojkar där den ena sägs vara ""den rätta"", den andra inte lika smart och en flicka som är super smart. Låter bekant. De ska föreställa att vara 12 år och det stämmer inte överens med hur de resonerar men samtidigt förstår jag inte hur de kan vara så långsamma på att addera två och två. Så tråkigt eftersom många tycker om den. Känner mig tvungen att läsa vidare på serien bara för att se om den går att räddas."
101,2,"This is a fine book for kids, and I think I would have enjoyed reading it out loud, but my kids are old enough to read their own books now. They both liked this series, and I appreciate the fact that it piqued my younger son's interest in Greek mythology.

As far as my personal reading experience, I didn't find here whatever magic makes the Harry Potter books transcend the YA category."

Gaaah, I am so disappointed and sad.



The ""Percy Jackson"" series has been on my to-read list for far too long, and honestly, I was expecting to love this.

I mean, a fantasy world based on Greek mythology?

Yes, please!

The gods running around being horn dogs and creating a whole bunch of confused demi-gods?

Yes, please!

A young main character who has to venture out on a dangerous quest to save the immortal world from civil war?

Yes, please and thank you.



Sadly, the book is sooo poorly written.



The plot moves at about a hundred miles an hour, leaving almost no space at all between the crazy action scenes, and no space for the characters to properly develop.

Additionally, the believability of the plot hinges on so many premises that are depressingly poorly worked out.

When creating a world that needs saving by an eleven year-old, you really need to create some rules and boundaries for that world that make a child's quest believable. Riordan, sadly, fails here. There is a whole cornucopia of plot holes that show Riordan simply hasn't spent enough time building his story.

Everything is also too easy for our heroes. Percy, particularly, who is entirely inexperienced (and spends less than a week training before his quest begins), should experience more difficulties in dealing with gods and supernatural beings who have, quite literally, been around for several millennia. If these beings are so easily tricked or beaten by eleven year-olds, they lose most of their ability to frighten and end up being comical rather than scary.

This is a problem that saps most of the tension out of the book, because you aren't actually worried that the heroes might fail.



The characters aren't too bad, but, as mentioned above, there isn't enough time to get to know them in between the constant action sequences.

Additionally, Riordan's trio of youngsters has a few too many similarities with another famous trio.

A troubled, black-haired hero thrown into a magical world of which he has previously been ignorant? A slightly comical best friend who, despite fears and misgivings, finds his courage and joins the hero in his adventures? A brainy girl without whose knowledge the quest cannot succeed?



The similarities to Harry Potter don't end here, and it's a little frustrating that Riordan didn't try just a liiittle bit harder at lending his characters some originality.

That being said, the dynamic between the three is entertaining, and I do think they work well as a literary trio.



The world is intriguing, but desperately needs more building up, and it also needs more clear-cut rules and limits.

There are, for instance, obviously limits to the gods' powers, but these limits are not made clear, and, as a result, their need for ""heroes"" to do their work for them becomes less than believable.

I the idea of bringing Greek mythology into the 21st century, but again, the whole concept simply isn't sufficiently built up. And the excuse for the gods' move to the US was flimsy.



Riordan's prose was probably my favourite part of this. It's not the most interesting thing in the world, but it's quippy and entertaining, and the writing flows really well.

To sum up, I feel like this first instalment in the ""Percy Jackson"" series would have benefited greatly from an editor who sat Riordan down and went, ""Look, I get that you like action sequences. But why don't we cut about five of them and make some room for proper world building and character development? Not to mention give your main character some time to get to know the ropes of the magical world he's about to be flung into, thus lending his quest a smidge of believability?""

All that being said, I do still think I'm going to continue to give this series a chance. Perhaps some of the problems that tripped me up in this instalment are dealt with in future books?

If you've read this entire series, please feel free to leave me a comment and let me know how this first book compares to the others in terms of the issues I've mentioned."

_____________________________

Don't ask me what my problem is, I don't know myself. In simplest words.. I don't like this book.

And I wanna cry about it myself because it was supposed to be my next favorite fantasy series after HP. I understand I didn't like the other series I tried to read (TOG), but this was Percy Jackson.. a bestseller. WTH!?

OK.. Let's get down to it.. Through the first 25-35% of the book.. I knew it was awesome! Amazing! Everything I was waiting for! The narrative!! Percy was hilarious! He caught my attention! A gem! The unexpected wierd stuff being thrown in, which looked like a building of a strong set of surprises, plot, twists!! I anticipated magic and a lot of adventure! His mother.. I sympathized with that woman. Sure she went through a lot.. for his son and suffered loads of hardships. But then she died. And I was like, 'Okay!'

When he was at the camp, I thought ""There it goes! Building friends and enemies! For a whole year and drama!"" But no... Apparently there's gonna be a quest, cuz the-

GODS ARE FIGHTING!!
(or wanna fight)

And two of the most powerful gods hate him already. His father doesn't gives a fuck about him. And on this quest there's only two people he can keep along (why again??) One of them is a satyr, so not much power.. and he really can't protect well (though I build a soft spot for him) and other girl whom you met uh... 2 weeks ago (very much like Hermione) and I couldn't trust her for the first half : the prophecy.

So.. the stakes are high. We want our dead mother back. Go on a adventure! Hurrah!!

But now... The things I couldn't understand begins.. 

First of them being, what exactly do we have to do? What's a bolt, how does it looks like? Where is it? Who's gonna help us, if any help at all? What about the humans if we have to tackle some monsters at earth? Can we, humans, in front of them? And like... kill the monsters if we have to? We have no addresses, where are we supposed to go?? Where?? When?? And just in 10 DAYS!??

And now begins the wait.. it's like a chain. You make a mistake. You got a monster. You fight. You make another mistake. ((AND THE LAMEST MISTAKES!!!)) And there, a monster! Fight, repeat. It was so confusing! I didn't know when to be shocked. When to think things are serious and risky and they might go wrong. One after other, series of events kept coming making no sense, leading to no plot. And BAM! We are underworld! I-

No... And in underworld.. ""Hey! Let's walk around! Have a look at hell and heaven and then say Hi to Hades and go back home"" That sounds easy? It was. Easy peasy. None of the expectations that I built of stakes, because 'UNDERWORLD' sounds scary, nothing kept up.

Then the fight with Ares. I thought.. finally.. action atleast? And it started. And I laughed.
And it ended.

Luke talked.

There's a spider!

“Oops.. I am leaving to bring back Kronos who would kick Greek Gods ass, and you get stung by a spider and die. And oh.. there's a God in that building few steps away but who cares. You will die by a spider if not all the monsters from underworld could kill you.”

Atleast Mom's back!"
117,2,"Originally, I gave The Lightning Thief one star. I hated the book. It made no sense, Percy was stupid, I hated the gods and the mythology, and overall, I didn't think it was a very good book. It was closer to a Harry Potter Alternate Universe fanfiction than an actual published story. It seemed like the title should have been Harry Potter and the Lightning Thief. Fast forward two years and I decided to give this book another crack, since my tastes had expanded and I've learned my viewpoint on books can change.

The Lightning Thief is about young Percy Jackson. For as long as he's known, strange things have happened to him. Things suddenly make much more sense after his math teacher turns into a screeching harpy and he kills her with a pen/sword. With a guiding hand from his satyr friend Grover, Percy makes his way to Half-Blood Hill, where he finds out he is a half-god. Percy and his father are framed for stealing the unthinkable; Zeus's lightning bolt. Along with Annabeth (daughter of Athena) and Grover, Percy must make fulfill a quest to return the lightning bolt to Zeus before the summer solstice, less World War III break out.

Since I am much older than the target audience for this book, I will review it with a grain of salt. But I will also keep in mind that I know my younger self would probably have the same opinions as myself.



My goodness, I could not stand a lot of the characters in this book. This book felt like a middle aged man in the body of a young teen. In other words, very unrealistic. Percy is an idiot. Honestly, he is. As the reader, if the author wants you to figure things out, they should put you one step ahead of the main character. In The Lightning Thief, the reader is leaps and bounds ahead of Percy. We figure things out way before he does, and that makes him seem much dumber.

Annabeth is alright, though she isn't as smart as she could be. Her plans aren't especially genius, and she spends a lot of the book not really doing anything. She's just the female character that sometimes says something smart. Although she was in most of the book, it didn't feel like it.

Grover was irritating. I couldn't stand him. He's obviously supposed to be the witty, funny sidekick, but he's just annoying most of the time. Like when he's sleeping and yells ""food"". That's not really funny. Not to mention he eats tin cans. Even though he's sort of a goat boy, goats don't eat garbage a lot. They actually never eat garbage like Grover does.

The gods were actually written alright. They were just as narcissistic, arrogant, rude, and hypocritical as in the original Greek myths. Although there was less rape and murder than I've come to expect from the Greek gods, it was still alright. I understand Riordan was trying to make this a child friendly version of our favorite raping, murdering gods from Greece.



Like I said before, this book just seems like a Harry Potter AU. Percy is obviously Harry, the main protagonist, Annabeth is Hermione, the brain in the trio, and Grover is Ron, the stomach, comic relief, and sometimes savior. Overall, I can understand why a lot of people like the book. Its a new idea in YA that hasn't really been done before. But there are very big things that made me side eye the plot. There were a lot of stupid things.

For one, there are things that just don't make sense. For example, things like Percy being kicked out of numerous schools. It's obvious that he's just an accident prone boy, not a juvenile. I feel like this is Riordan trying to give Percy a tragic backstory and failing miserably. Other things are simply illogical, like why would the Saratoga have cannons that are fully loaded available for the public to touch. Or, at the museum, where where all of the security guards? There were children stealing and harassing people, yet not a guard to be found.

There are a lot more examples that I don't feel like listing because there are so many. And they just don't make sense, even for a book about half-bloods and gods.

The biggest thing about plot that irked me was the fact that Riordan throws science out of the window. Things that are scientifically proven, are because of the gods. The sea and its waves? Not gravity from the moon, but Poseidon. The changing of the seasons? Not Earth being on an axis, nope, it's Persephone. With the magic in Harry Potter, I was fine with, because they didn't change the rules of science, magic was just an exception to the rules of science. With Percy Jackson there is no science! Just gods, and that is really irritating.



While I do think that Percy is an idiot, I have to admit that Riordan did a good job on the first person point of view. Many authors don't use it correctly. First person should give the main character a certain voice, which Riordan does very well. Nowadays, authors are writing in first POV in a sort of omnipresent way. In Percy Jackson Percy has his own voice, and anything he doesn't know, the reader doesn't know unless they come upon the information themselves.



Very rarely nowadays are there characters who have disabilities. It's nice that Riordan has and entire book full of characters who have disabilities. It's especially heartening to know that Riordan's son has ADHD/dyslexia and he made Percy for him. Though I do like the idea, there are some flaws with it in the book. For example, you completely forget Percy has ADHD/dyslexia until he mentions it. Honestly, I don't think he actually has these disorders, but something similar to them. That would have been a better explanation. And a lot of things Percy talks about points to the fact that he's doesn't really have ADHD, just that he had ""battle aptitude"". Percy is anything but impulsive, though he does have some attention problems.

That's the other thing. With ADHD, children are distractible. If you really had ADHD, that would be a really bad thing to have in the middle of a fight.

And with the Dyslexia, why can half-bloods hear English perfectly fine? They can obviously hear Greek well enough to know it and translate it instinctively, so why do they not have troubles hearing. Like I said, it would have been better if someone in the book said that half-bloods have something close to ADHD/dyslexia, but not quite.



Overall, there were a lot of things I did not like in this book. There were some things that were very nice that I actually liked a lot. Like the ADHD/dyslexia. I can see the appeal of the book, but it's just not for me. There were too many things that I couldn't ignore that made the book undesirable in my opinion. I'd recommend the book to someone who liked Harry Potter and doesn't mind book flaws."
118,2,"I don't get it. How is this book not considered pure Harry Potter fanfiction?

The mother protecting her child from evil. A trio: the unknowing hero; the goofy male best friend; the intellectually superior girl. One of the evil creatures in this book is a snake woman with the power to petrify people just by looking at them.

I'm not angry about it being so like Harry Potter, I already knew it was, and it's a perfectly good story, but I am confused as to why it's so popular. There is just so much more going on in the Harry Potter books. How are you not, like me, completely underwhelmed?

Also, Harry Potter wasn't born with the ability to defeat his enemies, he didn't pull out some superpower during fights, he survived by having a great support system and slowly becoming aware of his abilities and his purpose. In comparison, . Percy doesn't train hard to be a good swordsman, he doesn't spend that much time at camp, he just naturally pulls out his inner swordsman when he most needs to because of his birthright ADHD.

And look, no shade to an author that turns a dyslexic kid with ADHD into a hero, kudos for doing that, but please, , also encourage achievements reached through strength and effort and actual hard work, not just through some intrinsic value that was there from the start.

. That is my main takeaway from this book and it is also why I won't be continuing the series.

As a farewell gift I'll treat you to my favourite horrible line from this book. You're welcome."
119,2,"2.5 stars

I feel a little mixed on this book. I originally picked it up when I was around 12, read the first chapter, and then proceeded to put it down for 16 years... and honestly I think I stand by that decision. I probably would have enjoyed it more when I was 12 considering that was when it would have been an ""age appropriate"" book for me so I'm trying not to be too hard on it. Though, I'm not sure this first book would have piqued my interest enough to get me into the series at that time anyway.

The writing is technically fine. I was a bit bored by the narrative structure of ""we meet a new person and are continuously shocked that they're actually a Greek myth"". Like I get this was for kids but do we really think these characters wouldn't have started to be a little skeptical at some point? Or that kids reading this aren't smart enough to also get a little tired of this?

Maybe it's because I'm a 28 year old living in 2023, but I have less of a tolerance for this sort of interpterion of the Greek Myths than I would have at 12 in the early 2000s. I have too much sympathy for Medusa and Hades and too much dislike for the Greek Gods themselves to really be able to side with them. Like we're supposed to think Zeus and Poseidon are the good guys when the plot is literally that they have sex with a bunch of human women and abandon their children? ... maybe the future of the series is going in this direction but I'm not sure I'm actually willing to find out after the first book.

Ultimately, I can see why this series was so popular when it was popular but I'm not sure it's aged as well as it could have."
120,2,"I could not help noticing that there were similarities to Harry Potter, especially when it comes to the three main characters: Annabeth likes to read, she is the daughter of Athena (goddess of wisdom) and she is a know-it-all: she’s Hermione. Grover is a timid guy whose input in the action is basically nonexistent but he’s the main character’s best friend: He’s Ron. And the kid with no skills whatsoever but special by birth (because he is the son of the god Poseidon) is Harry or Percy, whatever.

I don’t mind if Rick Riordan took the Harry Potter books as inspiration, but I feel like his characters are devoid of the bonds of friendship, loyalty, and fellowship that make Harry, Hermione, and Ron so likable and so close.

I felt like this book was a series of pointless events unfolding one after the other that had no real impact on the personality or the actions of the characters: Percy’s mom dies and he doesn’t shed a tear, the guys are deceived and almost killed by Medusa and they keep trusting strangers. It doesn’t make any sense.

I gave it 2 stars (not only one) because I want to avoid bias. Firstly, because it is possible that the reading of this book was a little more boring because I had to look up a good number of words and phrases because English is not my native language. Secondly, it wasn't all bad: I learned a good amount of greek mythology because every time a new god, goddess, or mythological creature was named, I would google it and read the myth.

In conclusion, it seems unlikely that I’ll finish the series. I didn’t even finish this book, I only read 55% of it."
121,2,"I think I am the only person in the world that didn't completely geek out and fall in love with this book.
I was incredibly bored most of the time and the only reason I read the entire thing instead of stopping after my 100 page rule is because I was trying so hard to figure out why everyone loved it so much.

I can't figure it out.

Percy was a whiny little baby most of the time, walking around with a (what I picture to be a whiny little nasally voice) all ""why won't you tell me anything? even though you told me not to, I'm going to say every single mythological creature's name out loud to create thunder... just to disobey you because I don't want to believe it, etc. etc.""
And if it's not whiny little Percy, its the evasiveness of all the other characters in the book. Hi, yes, you're important but we don't know why and we don't want to tell you either so just do as we say and we'll all pretend to like you.

So why I kept reading an additional 200 pages after that? gods know.

it didn't get any better

I wish I could have my Friday back

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go yell ""STELLA"" outside and hope Marlon Brando falls from the sky, because that's how things seem to work in Percy Jackson's w0rld, right?"
122,2,"I loved this series as a teen. Coming back to it as an adult, nowhere near as good (not that it should be the same as when I had the imagination of my youth)! However, I have seen lots of comparisons between this series and Harry Potter, some even saying this is a rip off of that series. I strongly disagree that it’s a ripoff. I mean, what heroes journey isn’t some version of the heroes journey before?

That being said, comparing this start to a series to the start of Harry Potter, this book just lacks. The dialogue isn’t just childish, I can handle childish in a child’s book. It’s just plain boring and spoon fed. The story was rushed and didn’t seem very coherent or well thought out.

As a yearly reader of the Harry Potter series, each time I return to the Philosophers Stone, I’m immediately brought into a magical world that seems so well formed. The dialogue is intentional, the relationships seem genuine and real, and it stands the test of time (it’s ability to be read and reread never ruins the magic).

I am going to continue on my quest to read this series through once again, but I just can’t help but be nervous that the rest of the series will continue to have these same issues. Here’s to hoping!"
123,2,"Ahora puedo asegurar que el cliché del Elegido que no tiene ni la más minima idea de quien es y de la misma forma no tiene entrenamiento alguno no es lo mio.
Ahora bien , Tenia muchísimas ganas de leer a Percy Jackson he escuchado buenas reseñas pero este libro no fue lo mío . La mayor parte de la lectura se me hizo tediosa y un poco arrogante , siempre que iba a pasar algo interesante o se daria una información valiosa algo debía pasar y te dejaban con la voca seca.
Todo era muy obvio, Percy movía el agua y el campamento era tipo ummmmm creo que eres hijo de Apolo . Además la mayoria de los enemigos eran tan evidentes cómo la típica mujer con los ojos rojos y uñas largas quien se encontraba en un lugar nada confiable . El autor solo me estaba dando vueltas todo el libro y no me llevaba a lo que realmente me importaba. Debo aceptar que el final no me lo esperaba pero eso no cambio mi experiencia con el 87% de la lectura.

Aún asi no puedo negar que todo este mundo es maravilloso y el hilo con los dioses es toda una obra de arte , por esto le dare una oportunidad a los siguientes libros."
124,2,"Mi hijo de 10 años me dijo que leyéramos la saga de Percy Jackson y como en cuestión de lectura nada, absolutamente nada le niego, empezamos la lectura.
Disfruté Los Dioses del Olimpo porque me explicó cada dios, sus aventuras y desencuentros. Además fue chistoso escuchar a mi hijo identificar entre sus compañeros las personalidades de los dioses.
Sin embargo este libro me resultó confuso en redacción, aburrido por momentos, me extravié en la historia y no lo disfruté.
A veces me pasa así, las lecturas están hechas para una edad determinada."
125,2,"Me da la sensación de ser el Benjamin Button de las lecturas. Con 16-18 años leía como una posesa a Nora Roberts y Danielle Steel y ahora con casi 40 me pongo a leer Percy Jackson. Al revés del mundo xD

La verdad es que en su día perdí la oportunidad de leer historias como esta de Percy Jackson o Harry Potter y siempre he tenido esa espinita. He querido corregir eso pero me doy cuenta que ya es tarde. Seguro que si este libro lo hubiera leído años atrás lo habría disfrutado más. Fallo mío por no haberlo leído cuando tocaba.
Seguramente lo intente también con Harry Potter, a ver si con él tengo más suerte."
126,2,"This may be super unfair because there's not anything specifically bad about this book, it's just.....look....he's a 12 year old who with zero training, learns that gods exist and 2 minutes later believes it and starts killing monsters with very little trouble. Rips a horn off a goddamned minotaur for goodness sake. Like on page 30. Harry Potter had 6 books of education and 100% accidental success before he ever went in to really fight. Unfair comparison obviously but they were the same age. And both had a smart female side kick and a useless 3rd wheel. ( Ron and a goat )"
127,2,
128,2,"A weak replication of Harry Potter. Maybe if i've read Harry Potter in my current age i would have also thought it was too plain. The Greek world of Percy Jackson is not as logical as you would expects. Magical things just happen without explanation, Percy gets help and magical tools without explanation, he happens to know what to do and say while this is not obvious to the reader. And why Gods are so dull in this book?"
129,2,"honestly, i did not enjoy it at all. i hate the narrator, and i think that’s what killed it for me. this is one of the most beloved childrens’ series at this point, so i tried to give it another shot, but i know i won’t be reading the other ones unless i decide to try book #2 in a print format. i understand im not the target audience for this book and that’s okay, it just wasn’t even good compared to most MGs /:"
130,2,"2ish ⭐️

This was part of my “let’s read a popular series I’ve never read before” goal. I honestly wanted to love this series. I was so excited to read it, that I bought pretty much the whole series at a book festival…

I was so eh about this book. I don’t like the narrator at all. I know the MC is supposed to be a 12 y/o boy, but the narration sucks.

I just had this audiobook on as background sound while doing chores. I couldn’t make myself pay attention to everything.

I really think if I had read this as a kid I would have loved it."
131,2,"2.5 stars. I know I'm being harsh but I just couldn't connect with this book. We're not meant to be. I felt like reading something trying to be Harry Potter. The only thing I appreciated was the dyslexia and ADHD topic. I saw the final plot twist coming since page 1. Will not continue the series.
Ideal month for reading it: summer months, June to September."
132,2,"I wanted sooo badly to be a fan of this series, if only to be able to enjoy the infinite amount of books there is, but damn, it was such an average read for me – nothing stood out to me, not even the world building and the mythology of it all.
I’ve been in quite the reading slump though and perhaps that didn’t help, so maybe in the future I’ll give the second book a try."
133,2,This was very underwhelming 😭😭😭 why whyyy I feel like I’ll still read the series if I find out that it gets better. Maybe I should’ve read this in middle school but now I just don’t like it at all I had no emotion towards ANY of the characters it was just like oh this happened ok walk fight repeat like what
134,2,
135,2,"AUDIOBOOK. I read this to prepare to teach 8th graders about Greek mythology. It was my attempt to connect to their prior knowledge since many of them had mentioned reading or watching Percy Jackson. It was a good refresher of the mythology, but as an adult reading this by myself it was painful to get through the writing designed for children."
136,2,"I made it halfway through this book, but I couldn't go any further. The story was just too familiar and predictable (think Harry Potter, etc.), but without the cleverness, inventiveness, or storytelling panache of Harry Potter.

No me generó nada. Todo careció de profundidad, las cosas se sucedían ridículamente rápido, un montón de escenas prácticamente de lo mismo al re pedo. No lo odié, pero tampoco me gustó nada, sinceramente no me daban ganas de leerlo.

166,2,"There are definitely spoilers and some lost marbles in this review, so beware.

Look I get that it’s a book for children, but media being “for children” doesn’t make it exempt from criticism. That argument really doesn’t work for me, especially seeing as how easily influenced children are and how they learn parts of their values and mindsets through the media they consume. Something for children should be good no matter how little critical thinking you think they might have, those little information sponges deserve only the best.

Anyway.

I’ve been wanting to read this book FOREVER, but it is so insanely popular that you basically have to fight over it in the library. Sadly it wasn’t worth the trouble as I really didn’t enjoy it.

The writing and pacing are fine, but everything is so LOOSE and AIMLESS. There are so many things that either don’t get explained well – if at all – or the author brings up something that never comes up again. Was it ever explained why monsters hunt halfbloods? Did the Fates in the beginning matter, at all? Why did Annabeth take Aphrodite’s scarf, why was it there at all if it isn’t important to the plot? Now I’m aware that all of this could be revealed in the next books in the series, but … why bother at this point? None of those things are intriguing enough to keep me reading.

The characters are downright horrendous. Percy is an annoying brat, but with that he has the most personality of everyone else in the book. Speaking of them, I can’t believe how long it took everyone to realise he’s the son of Poseidon. Like his water powers aren’t enough of an indicator? But just to make sure really gets it, the trident symbol floats over Percy’s head once water touches him – once. Only that one time. Never before, never again.
I don’t know what the point of Annabeth and Grover was, at all. Especially Annabeth. She’s there to be a love interest, I suppose? And to tame Cerberus, who for some reason (plot convenience) listens to her. Grover actually does things, but would be utterly useless if it weren’t for the flying shoes. Great guardian, that one. Why does he eat cans again..? Is that a goat thing?

This might be a pet peeve, but I utterly hate the generalisation. All “bully” characters are ugly and dumb, and an entire group of them is also related to Ares because obviously the lust for fights is running in their blood, that is an inheritable trait after all. Annabeth is the daughter of Athena, that makes her smart, and nothing else. Underworld creatures are all evil, because Underworld, duh. The guy with the scar is a bad guy, who would have thunk. There is no nuance whatsoever.
I guess that is actually a very common theme in children’s media because it’s very easy to get, but I honestly don’t think children are incapable of understanding characters with a little more depth than that.

Another pet peeve is that all of this is taking place in the USA because it’s the new centre of culture or whatever. The Olymp being in the Empire State Building is one of the silliest things I have ever seen. You could have made it omnipresent like Heaven, with several entrances all over the world and half bloods coming from all kinds of cultures and countries, but nooo it has to be made US centric, because of course.

Also, last but not least I need to talk about how they just casually killed four people in the end – three of them completely innocent from what we know – and then . H o l y s h i t. Why yes children, if somebody is mean to you, it is okay to kill them, you completely have the moral high ground there. Remember that. Also how it was just done so nonchalantly. As if nobody would realise four people disappearing without a trace. Those guys had FAMILY. WTF.

Uh so, yeah, I did not like this book, I am not going to read any of the others. I understand that people like the concept and to think who could be there godly parent, and I am glad they find joy in this. But I really just … I can’t."
167,2,2.5/5
168,2,"Everyone seems to love this book, but it just wasn't for me. Maybe it's because I had already seen the horrible movie version, or maybe because it felt like a mediocre Harry Potter rip-off about illegitimate children (fun! explain that to your kids.). I think my daughter loved it because she read it when she was a middle-grader (is that a word?) and was really into Greek myths. I like the myths too, but I couldn't get past how dumb these kids were. Monsters are everywhere and they are after us, but let's go try out these free hamburgers from this strange woman... Guess I'm not the target audience for this book. I read it for my reading challenge ""over 1 million ratings on Goodreads"" so at least I can check that box and move on."
169,2,Insipid
170,2,"In my ongoing research of novels: both bestselling and good, I figured I should give this one a try. Sure it's for a young audience, but I'm also a big Greek history buff.

Hmmm. The voice is engaging, and it's certainly easy to read. The idea is great. The characters fine, not good but fine. The writing is stiff, and the plotting... oh the plotting is pretty awful. I really don't understand why it sold so well. Perhaps it's a vaguely educational angle?

himself is likable, although he is unrealistically brave in this just-go-for-it-because-I-know-as-protagonist-I'll-win way. The rest of the characters are pretty one dimensional, although they do fulfill the requisite positions.

The flip style is good, but not exactly ground breaking, and the sentences are clunky.

I'm a stickler for accuracy with regard to mythology. But mostly, that part isn't too bad. Sure he completely goofed , as they are hybridized horse people, not related to goats (although they are partial to the beasts). . And on a related note, was lamely portrayed, missing out on any of the interesting nuances and dichotomies of the god. That's the name of the game for this book -- shy on nuance. Sure he throws in all sorts of figures from , but very little of their subtle and interesting character is retained. But the modernized updates are sometimes fun. Even so, this wasn't my big problem with the book.

The plot. The premise of modern day child of the gods is great. The overall arc of the plot is fine, that a war of the gods is brewing. It's just they way the main quest is actually architected. The middle 50% of the book consists of a series of encounters with monsters literally concatenated with nary a thought as to connection or relevance to the overall story. In fact, you could delete quite a few of them and never notice. This is always bad writing. If a scene can be deleted without incident, well then, it probably should've been. The overall taste we're left with is one of ludicrous coincidence, where everything just happens to the hero.

Then we get to the end. Can we say cheesy melodrama. There's no real menace, or challenge. Things just kind of happen. Mostly the hero solves them by whipping out his sword disguised as a pen. It all works out. It didn't have to be this way. is much better plotted.

Now I have to see the movie and compare. This may be a chore. I wonder if the series gets better, but I don't have the interest to find out."
171,2,"So I finish my last final exam and instead of packing for Spring Break like a normal human being, I instead go and get drunk, toddle home, and crack open a box set of Percy Jackson books which I proceed to read while eating stale marshmallows. Because I'm a nerd. And because when I'm drunk, children's literature is one of the few things I can read and sort of remember. After restarting the next morning (this time nursing a hangover), I have come to the following conclusions:

1) I am going to see this movie.
2) What a terribly repetitive book.
3) Greek mythology is badass.

To elaborate: Percy Jackson (and the Olympians, #1--- how fun to get to something after they've written books 2-through-god-knows-what) was an excellent way to spend a hungover morning. The writing is subpar (to be expected as it's narrated by an eleven-year old boy), the characters aren't particularly complex (ideal for film-making), and the plot is horrifically repetitive (Percy goes on a quest; he encounters a dozen or so mythological creatures who are out to get him; he ignores a gut feeling that said disguised mythological creature is out to get him; he then fights his way out of it. lather, rinse, repeat). Yet the premise is pretty neat. I remember reading a Choose Your Own Adventure in 3rd grade that involved a scion of the Olympians running through a flip-to-this-page maze of challenges, and that's essentially what happens to Percy. Son of Poseidon, he discovers his heritage and traipses along with Greek myths-become-modern-day-characters to recover a stolen lightening bolt. Promises of sequels, movie deals, and a scary prophesy follow. Riordan ain't no Rowling, but he's not a total hack either. It's nice to see there is a generation rediscovering these myths through Riordan's shiny, action-packed lens.

Tips-o-the-Hat:
-Percy is kind of sweet. Throughout the book, he notices that evil characters need love too. Cerberus is just a lonely pup who wants to play ball and even Hades would just like some peace. It's a nice touch and lends some depth to ""good"" and ""evil"".
-Riordan pulls out some nifty details. Special points to the smell of a minotaur, the way a satyr would wear shoes, and a forcefully sobered (and appropriately pissy) Dionysus.
-Poignant and creepy imagery. The fates knit a giant sock at a roadside fruit stand in the Southwest. Styx is polluted with eons' worth of human detritus (dreams, hopes) cast off as the dead are ferried across. A hotel Lotus that traps kids of eternity with the lure of video games.
-Side story of Percy's single mother and her abusive husband.
-The entrance to hell is in LA.

Shakes-o-My-Fist:
-Daugther of Athena. Wasn't she a virgin? Jesus? Bueler?
-Percy's kind of a nard. How many times does he have to be duped? I'm no 10 year old reader, but come on-- even they must be bored.

I scoff, but books two and three are on my nightstand. And Clash of the Titans is about to hit theaters. Yesssss.


Megan Lebow: I keep thinking back to that summer at SUP when you taught the mythology curriculum and your super-nerd children would play Greek mythology at the pool. ""I am Poseidon, lord of the sea!!!"""
172,2,"This book reads at about the difficulty level and intensity of a Goosebumps selection with a higher page count. I would say it is written to cater to young readers because I have a hard time believing it fits into a young adult category. Whatever fun there is to be had by a more developed reader could be very well overshadowed by the large amount of muck which gets in the way.

The good: It is highly action oriented. Literally every chapter involves a battle with some monster or entity from the Greek pantheon's roster of baddies. The Greek pantheon alone is fun to deal with even in this sort of watered down and desanctified manner. It is easy to slide right through as the action never really lets up and there is nothing overly boring or tedious to wade through.

The bad: It isn't original in its base framework. Extremely predictable. The entire setup parallels Harry Potter so much that it is hard not to shake your head at the obvious template usage. The ancient epic monsters and gods all seem on the same level as the hero(a child). The writing is silly and often ridiculous. The hero doesn't make sense. He is 12(ish) and acts like he was plucked straight out of a teen angst movie from the 1980s. It is all entirely convenient and even suffers from an awful ""band-aid"" ending (here you go, all better).

If you are suitably young enough and/or your reading skills are relatively undeveloped this book would be excellent for you. If you can't seem to choke down enough Goosebumps or Harry Potter then this book will work for you. If you are into ancient mythologies you might dig this. If you are looking for something silly and relaxing that you could enjoy shaking your head at, this will do. If you were ever a fan of (the stupidly silly )Hercules: The Legendary Journeys or Xena, Warrior Princess you might just love this book.

My largest complaints about the book were directed more at choices by the author to portray real circumstances and conditions as laughable or admirable. His casual throwing around of ADHD and dyslexia as amusing or admirable conditions is a little concerning. His attempt to idolize an F student as a great hero to a young population of readers is also a little off-putting.
Aside from that a few things occur which really don't make sense at all, such as the disparity between Greek gods who adapt with the times and seem to flow with ""Western Civilization"", but seem to have some inherent ancient Greek to them which they seem to stick to for no apparent reason other than that is the culture which worshiped them.

Can't say that I found the experience more painful than it was enjoyable."
173,2,"What if the Greek gods were alive and well? What if Olympus moved from place to place and wherever it stopped became the new center of western civilization? What if they kept canoodling with mortals and produced flocks of demigods who were especial targets for attack by monsters and other gods? What if a nefarious someone tried to whip up war between the gods and used one of these demigods as a patsy? These are all questions that add up to a fascinating concept. However, the unimaginative, thoroughly derivative structure of this book makes it little more than a fairly forgettable Harry Potter clone. The plot was constructed from Rowling's formula with the same skill of a sixth grader plagiarizing a Wikipedia entry: trio of children (everyman boy hero, brainy girl, and goofy sidekick with a heart of gold) from a training ground for speshul snowflakes go on a quest and find a great artifact, with only the skimpiest number of changes to distinguish itself. This book came out during the ascension of Potter Mania, and it shows.

My biggest problem with Percy Jackson as a protagonist is also present in the Potter source material. In Rowling's world, the characters are almost entirely determined by accidents of birth, though she at least pays lip-service to self-determination. Removing a hero's ability to choose the heroic path makes him or her into an object that is thrust from setpiece to setpiece rather than a subject. Riordan gives Percy choices that aren't really choices at all (e.g., ""go on this quest, or I'll turn you into a dolphin,"" or ""go face monsters in the real world or stay here with no friends""), his path was determined at conception and shaped by a few convenient prophecies along the way, all of which makes him a hero so bland that no amount of wisecracking can make up for it.

All these shortfallings of originality could be forgiven if the writing had transcended the source, or if the author had taken the concepts popularized by Rowling and somehow made them better. But the clunky dialogue and sparse characterization, which aim for a balance between the contemporary (hip) and the allegorical (bad-ass), come across as pompous and silly.

I will emphasize again that the concept of these books is good, and if you're looking for literary Methadone to help ease you out of Harry Potter withdrawal or a quick, entertaining read, then you've found it. If you're looking for imaginative, well-written YA fantasy, I strongly suggest you pick up a book by Cornelia Funke, Ursula le Guin, or Kate Di Camillo instead of this one."
174,2,"Damn, this book is weird! I was looking for an alternative to the Harry Potter-series which I absolutely adore and thus found my way to the first Percy Jackson book, since nearly all reviews here on goodreads are raving. But I wanted to read an alternative to Harry Potter, not a copy!
It is really hard to read this book without thinking how strongly Riordan copies J.K. Rowling. But whereas she has a really, really interesting style of writing, tied in with magnificent plotting and great characters, this book just falls flat in all these regards. This can already be seen by looking at the first sentences - Harry Potter starts with „“ Isn’t this pure genius? If you would not know that this book is about magicians and about a guy named Harry Potter, you would just think „Duh?“, but weirdly enough it still creates a strong sense of excitement because it is all normal and thus, it is implicitly stated that these things are about to change.
Now here’s the first sentence of Percy Jackson: „“ It is just too plain, too straight-forward to ever create any suspension. The whole book possesses absolutely no sense of nuance.

Talking about nuancing: There are some really lunatic and cringe-worthy ideas in this book. Don’t believe me? How about these:
- WWII happened because the children of Zeus battled against the children of Hades. And Zeus’ children won.
- The Olympus is always above that place where the center of the occident resides at the moment. That’s why it is -of course- above the United States of America.
- The gods are having a lot to do - That’s why they chill out all day at the Olympus and need their children to do weird-ass quests for them.
- Percy’s best friend has legs and horns of a goat and bleats from time to time.
- Now, here comes the real kicker: Percy’s mother is living with a huge jackass who literally stinks. Later on, it is revealed that the bad guys can smell the half-bloods/demi-gods and that’s why Percy’s mother went for this stinking guy, so that his reek would cover up Percy’s smell. [WHAT THE ?!!?]


I still gave it two stars because I can see why some people like it: There are many action scenes, the plot -although clustered with plot-hoes- is very fast-paced and the book got a light chuckle out of me two or three times."
175,2,"The story behind Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief is probably more interesting than the novel itself: Rick Riordan made up stories for his dyslexic, attention-deficit son, transforming dyslexia and ADHD into veritible superpowers. Twisting the established practise of teaching young dyslexics Greek into a narrative where the protagonists can pick up Greek easily because they're the children of Greek Gods is a clever starting point for a book.

However, the novel feels flimsy, let down by an outrageously silly premise. Oh, sure, I read some books with outlandish premises when I was a kid, but it's difficult to suspend disbelief that the Olympians and their illegitimate children are wandering around in diners and water parks in the United States. It constantly feels like Riordan is desperately papering over the cracks of his unconvincing premise, filling in another (and another and another) plot hole with some narrative Polyfilla. It's made worse by the clumsy references to henotheism, positing that the existence of the Greek Gods does not preclude the existence of another all-powerful deity (obviously hoping to avoid hate mail from the Christian Right!).

Philip Pullman in made a similarly Homeric quest feel utterly real, despite its fantastical premise. That's my benchmark, and I'm afriad Riordan doesn't come close.

The novel's plotting is lumpy and episodic, relying on multiple characters carting around the to make it work. For instance, it takes an improbably long time for anyone to figure out that Percy might be the son of Poseidan, despite the fact that, on multiple occasions, he . For the reader, it's even more annoying, since the FRONT COVER shows Percy IN THE WATER.

I will give Riordan points for humour, since the book is funny in places (my favourite character is Grover, a satyr who can only play two tunes on his pipes: one by Mozart and one by Hilary Duff). Unfortunately, it's exactly Riordan's painstaking construction of comic situations that helps make the plot so riddled with diversions and distractions.

As I've said of children's books in the past: fifteen years ago, I might have given a pass, but the landscape of children's literature has changed, and if you're trying to compete with JK Rowling and Philip Pullman, you're gonna have to try a little bit harder."
176,2,"No. I did not enjoy this book.

I don't care about any of the characters. And it's funny how none of this kids act like kids at all. What is more they don't even feel like their own person. Its rather like they are the gods themselves not the offspring. I mean, just because your parents don't like each other does that mean the kids mustn't get along? WTF kind of a racist (familist?) camp is this.
Percy is completely devoid of personality or emotions. And the narrative is from his point of view. He is completely unfazed by any monster on strange and unnatural event around him. His mother ""dies"" in front of his eyes and there is no spec of sorrow or grief or anger in him after this fact. He learns who his father is (and that he is alive) and is just like 'OK, I have a father'. He meets him face to face for the first time in his life but has absolutely no emotional reaction to this. Not even curiosity. Why would there be any need for his approval. He is also a Gary Sue. In a span of 2 weeks he becomes this invincible hero with all the water-bending powers without even putting any effort to. It is also weird how we are told by him he got kicked out of school 6 times but never shown properly why. If it really wasn't his fault, there should be scenes to show us why we should root for him. Make us like him. I really don't understand why so many people praise this book series. It's just another chosen hero kid story trying to be a mystery novel (in a very broad sense). But the thing is Percy at the start of the book is the same as in the end. There was no character growth or development at all. He overcomes no real struggle. On the end when he is faced with the decision to stay just for the summer or whole year I genuinely didn't understand why that was even a question. Or why would it be a tough decision to make.

Also this ""wester civilisation"" that is praised to heavens in this book refers to the last 500 years since Europeans invaded the continent of what is now known as America with all the immigrants from every other part of the world. How exactly does this civilisation differ from the European in this last 500 years? How far east was Greece 2000 years ago? All the way to China?"
177,2,"I debated long and hard about whether to give this book 1 or 2 stars, but I decided on two because it was JUST good enough to force me to finish.

This book has a lot going against it: terrible writing, predictable plot, shallow characters, uneven pacing.

This book has only one thing going for it: an interesting idea that feels more and more, as I look back on it, like it was ripped off from Harry Potter.

Let's look at the similarities, shall we?

Boy discovers he is not normal and has extraordinary power, and that he is actually a demigod. He goes to a special summer camp where other people like him train to use their powers better, called Half-Blood Hill. Once at Half-Blood hill, the students are separated into separate cabins based on who their parents are. He has a special rivalry with another cabin called Ares. The houses play a game against each other called capture-the-flag, and the winner has their banners put up around the school. He goes on a mission to save the world with his two friends, Grover and Annabeth. They have an invisibility baseball cap. At the end of the story, the incarnation of evil is about to come back from hiding, named Kronos.

The main problem with this book, however, is the break-neck pace that allows for absolutely no character development, no moral development, and no depth for any emotion. It careens onward like the imaginations of a 10-year-old. The plot runs in excruciatingly predictable cycles, making what's about to happen so obvious that it makes you more impatient every moment.

But then again, I did finish the book. Why? Morbid curiosity. I had to see if I could predict every last detail from the very beginning, to see if I was right about the books biggest and final reveal. It turns out that I was, so that was a let-down."
178,2,"I picked up this book about two years ago, at age 12, because many of my friends were reading and recommending it. It seemed like a decently interesting concept for a novel, and the fact that it was so well recommended just made me more eager to read it.

When I borrowed this book from the library, I honestly tried to read it, but I could not get past the first few chapters. Maybe it's just because I'm an avid reader and usually read books for an older audience, but I found the writing to be nothing special, and the plot developments uninteresting and somewhat random. I usually stick to a book all the way through, no matter how much I dislike it, because most books get better later on. Maybe The Lightning Thief does - I just couldn't bear wasting my time to see.

For example, in the first chapter (SPOILER) his teacher randomly becomes a monster. What? This just didn't sit with me. There's this kid who seems pretty normal, and then out of the blue, his teacher becomes a monster and he manages to fight it off. Regardless, I stuck to the book for another few chapters, but nothing sucked me in. I just had a gut feeling as I read it that this was just kind of dumb.

I can see how this novel could possibly appeal to a younger audience (maybe around 4-5th grade), which is the only reason I gave this two stars rather than one. Perhaps had I read this at a younger age, I would have enjoyed it - I don't know. I may someday try to read this again, but so far I'm not inclined to.

Just to add, I can't fathom why this book, and the others in the series, all have at least four star ratings when so many other books which are much, much better have lower ratings on this site.

I don't personally recommend this book, though I'm sure some elementary/middle school students would enjoy it, especially if they're into myths and fantasy. (But if they're into fantasy, better to get them The Hobbit, which is absolutely fantastic.)"
179,2,"And so I've read a Rick Riordan book at last.

Okay, so I'm just gonna go ahead and state the things I liked and didn't like, and get this over with.

What I did fancy was:
1) The Greek mythology.
Duh?
I've always been fascinated by ancient civilizations. And since I knew very little about ancient Greece, I was very glad by the tons of information and the educational side to the book.

What I wasn't very fond of was:
1) Mr. Riordan picked the easy way when he wrote this book. I mean, the same old boring ""suspense"" where the author keeps answers from the protagonist over and over until you're at least 50 to 60 pages in.

2) A trio? Really? Again?
Let me guess, there'll be hero, a smart girl and a goofy sidekick.
I wonder where he got the inspiration for these characters.

3) The plot was very predictable (and childish, needless to say) especially towards the end.

4) What's more was how exhausting it was to read this book. There's 22 chapters total, and almost 22 fights. A fight per chapter. In a period of two weeks. The fight reaches a climax and resolves in the same page.
That's not fast pace, that's crap.
Who does that?

5) The writing was blekh. It didn't show any skills at all, it was like reading an article off a newspaper. A bad one to be precise.
Now I understand this series is middle grade. However, I've read a couple of children's books (, , and naturally ) and the writing was never this bland.

6) The first person narration didn't help at all. I'd prefer it if it were in third person, or with shifting POVs.

7) A god in khaki shorts and Hawaiian shirt.
Need I say more?

As I was reading, the rating kept hovering between 3 and 4, but as I reached the end, I couldn't put up with the ridiculousness anymore.
One wonders by which book Mr. Riordan decided to take a turn in the series and shift it to a more mature audience.

2 stars."
180,2,"It was...predictable. There are a lot of clues and hints and actually, when you think about it hard enough, while some characters get introduced, it's quite obvious - what's the title of the book? The Lightning Thief, and, do you suppose this ""lightning thief"" will be revealed on the next books? Possible but probably not. Halfway through you might be 90% sure, but then again you just get some hunches and you won't know until you read further 'til the end. ;D In any case, I guess it's predictable for me since this isn't really for my age group but, okay, it was entertaining at the least, and a very easy read. And I have to say some parts did surprise me. :D I'd have given it three stars, but, I have a reason why I didn't (at the end of my review, but it contains spoilers).
The ""sub""protagonists, Grover and Annabeth, are very likeable. IDK but I liked Grover most. Percy is quite likeable, too, and for a kid his age he's quite the smart guy, a kid ""worthy of Athena"" (okay I won't elaborate I don't want to spoil too much).
Plus points: the exposition of Percy's ""other"" world was very nice. Best part of the book for me. :D

There's just one thing that bothers me, though : did the lightning thief really intend to kill Percy, well I'm quite sure he did it on the woods away from camp, but STILL dryads (or the tree spirits) and naiads (water spirits) would be there to help Percy, RIGHT? And correct me if I'm wrong but aren't they the ones who saved him? So, does the BIG BAD boss (the thief's master) intend on telling the whole camp, and the whole Olympus, about his plan?? I mean, the lightning thief DID intend to kill Percy, but then again Percy WILL be saved by the spirits, and won't the spirits hear their conversation?? Quite the bugger, yes, enlighten me, please. :("
181,2,"Percy Jackson, a troubled dyslexic 12-year-old withADHD, finds out that he is a demigod after some unusual events. He ends up at Camp Half-Blood after his mother takes him to Montauk for the weekend but they get attacked by a Minotaur and she disappears. At the camp, he learns more about life as a demigod, eventually learning that Poseidon is his father. He is sent on a quest to find Zeus’s stolen lightning bolt with the help of Grover, a satyr, and Annabeth, a daughter of Athena. The story progresses as expected, adhering strongly to a Hero’s Journey storyline with a cliffhanger ending beckoning for the next book in the series.
I understand that the series is intensely popular with children, perhaps due to their lack of exposure to better literature. It is incredibly derivative and predictable. The characters are flat, boring and irritating. Percy himself is annoyingly bratty and Riordan spends more time forcefully telling rather than showing Percy’s personality. The novel is overall very choppy and disjointed, which really causes the novel to drag on forever. The fight scenes lack any suspense, it is obvious that the kids will succeed with hardly any trouble or loss. There is no question to their eventual triumph as they face each obstacle and that absence of tension bleeds the fun out of what could’ve have been a wonderful story.
Riordan goes for the punchline every time with his allusions and homages to the classical Greek literature, resulting in shallow and trite depictions of the various Gods, Goddesses and spirits. His treatment of the material makes it seem as though even he doesn’t believe his story is real, as though the author himself was unable to suspend the disbelief necessary for the novel and it is infectious. Also, why in the world does Athena have children?!?"
182,2,"This was quite fun but the picky reader in me was just not satisfied. Putting aside the existence of Greek gods, 'Lightning Thief' did not make sense.

There were just too many coincidences. Percy did throw in some hints about weird things happening before it was revealed that he was a demigod, but once he started his journey to the Underworld he technically ran into trouble with the monsters and gods around every bend he took. Law of attraction? Yeah, right. I mean, of all places in the jungle (or wherever, I could not deign to remember) how could he end up at Medusa's place? Of all hotels in L.A how could he end up going to the Lotus-eaters'? And of all shops in Santa Monica, how could he end up hiding at Procrustes's water bed shop? It was not like Medusa or old Crusty came stalking after him like the Minotaur or the Furies. Considering its much shorter length(?), this books was more infested with coincidences than any of Charles Dickens's works could be.

And it annoyed me that Percy, who was smart enough to help his friends out of the scrapes at the water theme park or the water bed shop, could not see more obvious facts that hang just inches before his eyes. Of course he was Poseidon's son! How else could he sprayed Clarisse with toilet water? Of course the traitor was Luke! For what other reasons should those stupid flying shoes malfunctioned in the Underworld? And of course the real enemy was Kronos the Titan! Those were just the blaring facts anyone in Percy Jackson's shoes could not miss. But Percy, was he in some state of denial?

It was fun, I would not deny that. I particularly liked Hades, he was just hilarious. But it still reminded me of Harry Potter. The awakening of the dark power, the name you cannot mention kind of thing. Whatever. Anyway, anyone knows any book like this but with Celtic mythology instead?"
183,2,"I thought that Rick Riordan was, for the most part, reasonably good at plot development, character development, world-building, and the writing style was easy to read. This is a good novel to teach children Greek mythology in a way they can remember easily. I still didn't feel a reason to continue after Percy Jackson & The Lightning Thief. I was really excited when the novel said that our protangonist, Percy, went to a school for students with disabilities, and that he had ADHD and Dyslexia. I absolutely despised of how Rick Riordan handled that, though.





I really didn't find this appropriate of Rick Riordan. I was mostly just very disappointed, because he really set it up to have a disabled hero, but then he erased it completely. This reminds me so much of the ""queer baiting"" in Sherlock BBC.

I don't know what happens in the rest of the series, but I'm strongly encouraging Rick Riordan to do some research on the conditions he wrote about and read some stories by actual disabled people."
184,2,"Maybe I’m just the wrong age for this series, but what a disappointment. It’s like Harry Potter without the memorable characters or immersive world-building, or (perhaps more accurately) a watered-down American Gods. Uneven pacing, dull characters, an ending that goes on and on…

Also—the Greek gods following the heart of “Western Civilization” reeks of white supremacy."
185,2,"I really wanted to like this book. Things I did like about it: the way Percy, the main character, sounded like a realistic 11 year old most of the time. It's sometimes really hard for a writer to get that as right as Riordan did. I also liked the idea behind writing a series about heroes/demigods, the children of gods/goddesses and mortals, which Riordan calls half-bloods. I just don't know if I liked how utterly predictable the entire first book was. Also, it reminded me way too much of Harry Potter, in almost a ""let's take the exact same plot and instead of magic, insert Greek mythology"" kind of way, but that may just be the original set up and the rest of the books will differentiate themselves into their own stories. I may just be completely the wrong audience for this, and that's okay, but I might give a later book in the series a try to see if I can get past what I don't like or if the plot becomes less easy to guess later on. I didn't even feel like I was guessing; I was really frustrated by things I already knew way before Percy did. It felt a little like waiting for Robert Langdon to solve mysteries, especially in the way he later mentions how obvious they were because of this fact or that fact after he finally solved them. Because Percy does that, too. Some kind of weird suspense plot device or something. I realize I'm an adult and this is a children's series, so maybe it's just not for me, although there are plenty of children's books I still love as an adult or have discovered as an adult and loved. I think school kids learning about Greek gods might really love this and make their learning it easier to take. I'd probably give it 2.5 or 2.75 stars if those were options, because at least it was fun, and I finished it. *shrug*"
186,2,
187,2,"Percy Jackson is a fandom I have dabbled in before. Like most people I have seen the films several times and thoroughly enjoyed them. However I feel as though watching the films ruined the book for me a little bit mostly because I knew what was coming. Despite this I was pleasantly surprised by the simplistic and informal writing style, it made the storyline easy to follow because of the lack of distracting embellishments. Normally I don't enjoy this style of writing, it tends to bore me a little, but it's nice to have an easy read every so often. A huge asset of this book was that I found the greek mythology extremely interesting and loved the way it was incorporated into the storyline."
188,2,
189,2,
190,2,"This book, unlike the Harry Potter books, is written exclusively for kids from about 10-15. The Greek mythological references are plain and straight-forward; I suppose that means Riordan assumes most kids don't know much about the mythology. The plot is ok, but I have to say that many of the scenarios, character roles and relationships, and events seem to be blatant lifts from Rowling. For example, when Percy shows up at ""Half-blood"" camp, one character says, ""Our new...celebrity."" Shades of Snape! Percy, Annabeth, and Grover share exactly the same relationship as Harry, Heromine, and Ron. I know that someone will say: ""Well, Riordan is simply using the mythic archetypes -- as did Rowling, Tolkien, Lewis, etc. But I would disagree. The archetypes are there, yes, but the specific fleshing out of the characters and situations doesn't strike me as fresh.

Having said all of that, I still enjoyed the book -- the plot moved well and the characters were distinct, if not unique. Ultimately, I found Percy Jackson himself a little too much of a troubled-kid stereotype. It was difficult to empathize with him, even though it was clear that that's what Riordan desired.

As for themes -- what does this first book ultimately say? That mom was right to borrow those ""tools"" from Percy and turn the stereotypical bad step dad (Smelly Gabe)into a stone statue? The book lacked the depth and invention of Rowling's novels, which I come to appreciate more and more the more I read other adolescent fantasy literature. Read the books, , or even the novels first."
191,2,"This book is full with nothing but cliche. Reading the novel is like verifying what was written by Joseph Campbell. Most of the plot were predictable and not getting anywhere complicated. The plots are solved easily by using deus ex machina in many forms, such as magical items, god appearing nowhere, dream, etc. Evertime the hero is in danger or a plot stalled, the writer will just insert ""magical item number X"" or insert random god to solve the problem. It's like Harry Potter with Dumbledore everywhere having emergency call so he could appear anytime to resolve the problem.

Some people might notice the similarity with Harry Potter, however it wouldn't be fair because hey it's archetypes. Every story basically have same plot with unlimited variation.

Is this book thrash? No absolutely not.

It's pretty enjoyable and won't get you bored easily. What is the recipe of its successfulness? In my opinion it's the writer's writing skill that execute such typical plot into an enjoyable reading. Reading this novel is like reading Naruto or one of these shonen manga, seriously the plot flow is too similar and straightforward that I almost gasped.

There are too much books about ""hero is lost prince, having journey to find magical item to save the world"", however Percy Jackson getting my attention because it's successfully revisited these typical storyline. This book is far from terrible. I have read worse books that I would throw only after reading the first paragraph because it's uninteresting.

Conclusion? This book is originally for children. Young adults shouldn't expect much about this one. The story is pretty much forgettable however enjoyable it is."
192,2,"Ok. Ok, so this wasn't as bad as I was afraid it would be, but it didn't exceed my expectations either. Meaning, this book is obviously attempting to complete the successful recipe of Harry Potter but it does not succeed because there is no recipe. Percy is not Harry and Annabeth is certainly not Hermione.
The idea of the gods and their half-blood children is actually nice, but to say that the kids' dyslexia is a result of a predisposed mind to understand Ancient Greek - come on! People are perfectly capable of learning Ancient Greek (or modern, for that matter) or Latin and still be able to learn English as well. And don't get me started on Mount Olympus being situated over the Empire State Building. I understand the need for writers to write about their own country as if it were the centre of the universe, but why then does he need to take Greek myths and relocate them? It would be as if borrowing the Nordic mythology and place it in South Korea or the Arthurian cycle and place it in Turkey! But I'm biased, being Greek and all so I won't say anything else on the matter.
One last thing - and this is a soar point for me -, why do characters say things like ""I've never seen her be like this"" (insert scared/frightened/angry etc.) when they only know each other for a week? Why do they say ""he told me this a long time ago"" - when it's only been five days??? What is this? Time goes differently for children, yes, but not like this.
Anyway, I did read this in just two days and I wanted to see what would happen even though I knew what that was - you could smell the end from the first thirty pages. Maybe it gets better in the next books? One could only hope."
193,2,"There were some things I found enjoyable about the central conceit, that Greek gods sire mortal children who are doomed to repeat those , but overall, I found Percy an unlikeable clod, and the over-reliance on coincidence and deux ex machina to be too great (even for a book based on the Greek works in which such endings do normally figure prominently -- c.f. every Greek play written). As a piece of escapist reading, this book would be more enjoyable if I found the protagonist more appealing, I suppose, but in any event, as a piece of ""young adult literature"" I do not entirely approve of the lessons it seems to impart (like the fact that all authority figures are, in fact, out to get you).

The work also reeks of a massive dose of Eurocentrism -- why are only the Greek gods still around in modern day America, and not, say, the Etruscan or Aztec gods? by Neil Gaiman does SUCH a better job of exploring this idea, and why some gods have power and others do not. Of course, that is a work for adults, but honestly, I think it's possible in the YA world, too. The series or the trilogy both do a significantly better job of exploring questions at the intersection of mythology and faith, at a level that younger readers can still appreciate."

195,2,"Trouble seems to follow Percy Jackson wherever he goes. It's not just the fact that he has ADHD and is a major target for school bullies. No, it's the small problem that he sees mythical monsters that no one else notices. Even worse, those monsters want to kill him. It turns out that Zeus's master bolt has been stolen, and some odd reason Percy is the main suspect. With loyal friends in tow, Percy sets out cross-country to catch a thief and save what is most precious to him, even as the ugliest and nastiest brutes of the ancient world follow in close pursuit. Suddenly, being kicked out of boarding school doesn't seem so bad.[return][return]I've had this in my to-read stack for six months and decided to read it since the movie trailer has been out. My feelings are mostly negative. It's a very fast read, and suspenseful. It's also very middle grade and ridiculously predictable. You can see every major plot twist coming from a hundred pages away. I like that Percy is a regular kid with ADHD, but comparisons to Harry Potter are unavoidable (complete with new versions of Hermione and Ron). The bad guys are all cardboard cut-outs without a shred of complexity.[return][return]If I was 11-year-old, I could have read this and enjoyed it, even with the major transparency of the plot. As an adult... eh. I'll buy the next books if I can find them at a thrift store and I'd like to see the movie version (would looks radically different with much older characters) eventually, but I'm in no rush."

★★☆☆☆

Over a year later, changing my rating to 2/5 stars. I know for sure that I was trying to be nice on this one because I knew how many people loved it and assumed I was missing something. But I really didn't enjoy this book much at all. If I tried it now, I think it would be a DNF. But the combination of its popularity and the fact that I was more patient with books a year ago made me finish it. Also, do NOT do the audiobook if you have other options. The narrator was the worst. Thank you and goodnight.

3.5 stars

This was an interesting experience for me. I always felt like I missed out on the Percy Jackson books, so I wanted to at least try the first book in the series. This was, by all means, an excellent book for grade school. I think I would have adored and obsessed over this series if I had read it earlier in life. That isn't to imply that I didn't like reading it now, but I could tell I wasn't getting as invested as I would have when I was younger. I also chose to listen to the audiobook, and I've had mixed experiences with those so far. If I'm not completely engrossed by the story, I find that my mind can wander and I won't retain nearly as many details as I would if I'd read a hard copy.

To me, this was probably a very comparable experience to those that didn't read Harry Potter growing up and decided to start it as adults. It unfortunately loses some of the wonder and magic that way. However, I do plan to eventually continue with Sea of Monsters with a hard copy or e-book to see if it changes my experience at all."
197,2,"This was aimed at a younger audience than I was expecting, although now that I look, I see it's for 9-12 year olds. Which makes sense.

Overall a fun read, with some modern twists on Greek mythology, like a motorcycle riding Ares and such. Some of these worked better than others for me, but certainly imaginative. The plot points are heavily overshadowed, so you may spend quite a bit of time waiting for the characters to catch up and figure things out. But this never got to the point where I was impatient or outright angry with the characters, so I didn't mind.

One complaint though, is the the lean towards writing for the ""reluctant reader"" which crops up now and then. Things like calling a field trip to the museum ""torture"" or listing opera as one of the tortures of the underworld. I see where this comes from, and maybe if it works for some that's great. Still, this kind of thing bothered me as a kid as well, when reading, art, and culture were knocked by the main character. By trying to relate to the struggling reader, it alienates the bookworm.

I also may be picky here, but I think this also shows up in the food they eat. Chocolate chip cookies, burgers, XXXL fries, Double Stuf Oreos... all ""Fried, greasy, excellent food,"" and a welcome relief from healthy grapes and bread. Call me old-fashioned, but I'd much rather my heroes be admirable role models whenever possible."
198,2,"Decent book, but sadly Percy was in it."
199,2,"I have decided to change my rating because it didn't really reflect my feelings for the book, and while it hurts me that it could have an impact (albeit a very small one) on the overall rating because I respect Rick Riordan waaaaay too much, I'm working under the assumption that he most definitely doesn't care about it.

2.5 stars, good but a bit too slow for my liking and also I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I was going to considering I really loved the film and it's been talked up by so many people whose opinions I trust. I'm aware I'm definitely not the target audience for it, but that's never stopped me before. That being said, I am continuing and will most likely finish the entire saga."
200,2,"I dont know why so many people are obsessed with this book and I really dont know how it bagged so many awards. Either people overrated this book or there is something seriously wrong with me. Since my friends believe I'm normal, I'll go with the former conclusion. And I'm not so pleased with me that I read till the last damn page.

Greek Mythology * Harry Potter - Imagination = The Lightning Thief

This book is a poor attempt at creating a series alternative to HP. If you try to bash me for comparing both, well you have to know that I can't help myself come across some scenes which were deeply influenced by HP. There are lot more shades of HP from the start till the end and you end up reading the worst version of Harry Potter(). The author has just flicked the greek characters() and sprouted them in a not-so-impressive plot with an immature narration. I think the children rhymes are more intricate than this book.

It lacks imagination to be of fantasy genre and too immature to tag it as YA. Overall a very crude book and I'm giving it 2 stars because after reading this I started liking Harry Potter more for its originality()."
201,2,"I had hard time reading this book because I find it lame. Awesome idea ruined in my opinion! I read its young adult book but I think its good for under 14 or so...!!!
Some people say ""If you like Harry Potter, you will probably like this book, too. "" But oh come on!!! Harry Potter was so much better than this I could understand all the characters better. I cant even with Percy Jackson character...he faced her mothers death like ""oh! I lost one of my stuffs. thats sad!lets find it again from underworld."" Thats your mother stupid boy show some real emotions so that I can believe that you are a real character!oh wait,you are not. Oooopsss...
Yeah the beginning was so lame and trying too hard that I was annoyed the whole time reading this book but I must admit if its not good at being a young adult fantasy book,It had some funny dialogues. Those parts cool me down a little bit that I could give it 2,5 stars form 5 stars in the end.
As others say ""The concept in itself is very creative. Son of a Greek god in modern times. He is dyslexic because he is meant to read ancient greek.""
If I have read this book in the age of 12 I could have become in love with it.Now I know,I must take it more easy if I want to read the other books of this series."
202,2,"The premise of envisioning the Olympian gods in the modern world was interesting, but the plot, characterization, and writing never launched beyond ""OK."" I felt that the author might have done more, but he chose to follow the safe conventions of modern children's writing: an adventure that children must undertake alone, the obligatory main character + smart girl + clumsy sidekick, a crisis that arises and is resolved in every chapter, slangy first-person narration, bits of underdeveloped interesting ideas glued on all over the place to add atmosphere . . . the list could go on. Perhaps I knew too much mythology, but I often knew pages before something was ""revealed"" what the author was trying to surprise his readers with. All this can be shrugged off as an overcritical adult opinion of a children's book, though, if the book actually has something of worth at the end of the frivolity. But I really didn't feel that had anything of this sort. None of the characters showed much development, and the conclusions that the book came to seemed mostly to be of the ""attempt hard things and believe in yourself"" type. It seems one could have done a lot more with a pantheon of gods and heroes standing by."
203,2,"I read this because my kid read it and loved it (and several other Riordan books--I think he's on his 8th one in the last month? He really loves them!). He wanted me to read it and love it, too. Read it I did. Love it I could not. I tried. And I tend to enjoy fantasy, Greek mythology, and YA lit, so I'm not sure what to say except that I found this... shallow. Maybe I'm too old or too aware of the world's stories (I recognize that this is written for middle-schoolers and that I am not one), but it felt to me like it had no layers at all, and precious little mystery. The plot is fine, but the way the characters are developed is basically that they're not. And when a ""secret"" is shared, it's shared--and by shared I mean told, not hinted at--over and over and over. It's a bit like being hit with a house. I had read somewhere that these books were right up there with Harry Potter, and while I didn't expect that to actually be true, I definitely expected more in the way of nuance and intrigue to go with the action. I'm going to let my son tell me about the rest of these books. I just can't read more. I'll say this, though--the story is action-y and potentially visually interesting, so I'm willing to try the movie versions."
204,2,"This was very exciting, the characters are very interesting and Rick manages to keep many characters involved in the book without making it confusing. I wish I had a Percy Jackson phase when i was younger smh"
205,2,"Ok, so this book is another derivative of Harry Potter, in perhaps the most obvious rip-off yet: same cast of crazy supernatural characters, same boarding school setting for the training of young magical heroes (in this case it's a summer camp, but it's basically Hogwarts moved into the open air), same worn out themes (our young hero is basically an orphan with behavioral problems who faces abandonment issues, duals with beings far more powerful than he which he somehow wins, begrudging respect and fear from the other magical students, vague prophesies, and a general feeling of loneliness from being an ""other"", etc, etc, etc).

In any case, despite the blatant near-plagiarism, there IS a reason Rawling's books sell so well: these factors make for an interesting story. The conceit of this book is that instead of magical, the beings are immortal: the story is set amidst Greek myths. The children at the camp are the offspring of mortals and gods. The action moves quickly and at an enjoyable pace. The bottom line is, while Riordan gets no credit for originality, children who are upset that the Potter books are at an end will eagerly take up this series."
206,2,"Many of the students at my school love this book, and it's easy to see why: it's about a dyslexic, ADHD middle schooler who learns that he is the son of Poseidon and therefore has superpowers. (I bet my students wish they had superpowers, too.) I felt that the book started out well enough, but, for the critical adult reader that I am, didn't live up to its promise. First of all, the main characters just seemed kind of dim-witted. Despite the fact that they had stumbled into two consecutive situations where a trusted stranger turned out to be a mythical monster, they stumbled into at least two or three more by book's end. It seemed like the author's desire to write attention-getting action scenes killed any potential portrayal of somewhat intelligent characters. Second of all, this book was way too similar to Harry Potter to me. Sixth-grader who learns that he has magical powers and is a notorious figure in magical world? Check. Super-intelligent and clever female friend? Check. Loyal but not-as-talented male friend? Check. I'll probably read the second novel in the series--after all, HP #1 only set up the awesomeness that was to come. I hope it improves on this first book."
207,2,"Not my favorite. I'm sad I missed book club because sometimes I like a book better after going to the discussion. It's fantasy/young adult and in the same vein as Harry Potter except not as well written. There were also several knock-off concepts from Harry Potter that bothered me. Be original already! I didn't like the whole thing about not saying the names of the gods - too much like not saying Voldemort's name in HP. And the half-blood reference was very reminiscent of the mud-bloods in HP. Also, extremely predictable. I knew who the bad guy was the chapter after he was introduced. It was interesting to have a refresher on the Greek Gods...it's been years since sophomore year in High School World History when I had to memorize those!

Having said all the above, my 7-year-old really enjoyed it and it was nice to have something to discuss with him. I'm hoping to avoid all the questions surrounding the different mothers and fathers business with him for awhile with God's having children with mortals. That will be fun to explain. I won't recommend it to people my age."
208,2,"I m really in a bad mood.
I have expected a gud story and not gods ands heroes. Thats all bullshit.

And even if I dont believe in god that doesnt mean I would agree with this kind of insult to gods. Gods sleeping with human .....just doesnt seems right. One can give more respect than that.

And one thing is just stupid as it is. Gods fought in World War 2 and after that took oath to river stynx that they wont sire any child.

urghhhhh.....such a stupid thing. Medusa....has become aunty (grandmother) who now haunt this garden and captures children. And three children kills Medusa.
Ares, God of war !! and he's a bad bad biker and talks with contempt to children and asking for help from children. have really bad behavior and don't know how to talk to 12 yr old child.
How much more will this story degrade?!!

It seems author is not a great fan of Greek mythology. Seems like the author made fun of greek mythology.
I think this is for children. and I dnt know why the ratings are so high for this book.

Two star for being fantasy !!!"

Adventure
Percy is a twelve year old boy who has been in and out of boarding schools since before he could remember. He has horrible dyslexia, gets into trouble constantly and feels abandoned by both his mother and father. But all that changes when Percy learns hes not a normal boy but actually a child to the God Poseidon, God of the sea. When he is no longer safe in the real world he finds shelter at camp-half-blood. There he is given his first quest, to find Zeus's stolen thunder bolt. He takes along his best friend Grover and a girl Annabeth. The three face death and worse along the way but must make it to Hades, God of the underworld before time runs out.
I enjoyed the learning of the greek gods throughout this story, it gave a nice twist. But it was one book I was ready to put down half way through it. I'm not sure if it was the story line or the character development but I didnt become engulfed in the story as I usually am. But I'm sure some young people would find Percy relateable and his adventures to be exciting."
210,2,"Inutile dirlo: da questa saga mi aspettavo molto di più. Okay, questo è solo il primo libro e magari sono io troppo prevenuta, ma per ora PJ non ha avuto il potere di entrarmi dentro come ad esempio Shadowhunters. Ho trovato Il ladro di fulmini meraviglioso all'inizio, anche e soprattutto perché i temi trattati sono abbastanza originali e Percy è l'amore vero, ma penso che poi col proseguire dei capitoli si sia un po' perso. Di base ho continuato a leggerlo fino alla fine perché a) speravo sarebbe migliorato nuovamente; b) mi dà terribilmente fastidio lasciare i libri a metà e cerco sempre di evitare quando possibile. Nonostante tutto devo dire che non ho cambiato opinione su questo primo libro della saga, che sì è una lettura piacevole e tutto ma almeno per ora non è tra le mie preferite. Quando avrò un po' più di tempo libero comunque continuerò a leggerla, chissà che i libri seguenti riescano a prendermi di più!"
211,2,"Приятна книга, НО за деца. Не можах да я довърша, защото така и не предизвика интерес у мен и не бях нетърпелива да разбера какво ще се случи. Авторът си служи основно с диалози, които водят сюжета, а не с описания. Предполагам, че това е подходящо за деца, но на мен ми липсваше дълбочина.
Все пак, иска ми се да бях на 11, за да можех да ѝ се насладя истински и да стана част от света на Пърси. Засега явно ще разчитам на филмите."
212,2,"My Kindle has picked up on my childish streak, so it has taken to suggesting all kinds of juvenile fiction for me. This one was not my favorite. The characters were flat, the idea seemed overly contrived, and I wasn't as drawn into the world the way I was with the Septimus Heap or the Harry Potter books. As I was reading about the summer camp that the half-gods attend, all I could think of was a Berenstain Bears Go To Camp book that my son keeps making me read over and over. Sometimes young adult fiction isn't just repackaged adult books made more marketable, sometimes they truly are written for young adults. That being said, I may give the second book in the series a go if I can't think of anything else to read. I like the idea of the Olympians in the modern age, I just want them to be less... uh... cute."
213,2,"Clearly designed to help reluctant readers turn pages, this book is most definitely fast-paced. Unfortunately it is also extremely predictable: ""Percy meets creepy old lady.

Percy either starts the fight well and ends up needing to be rescued by his friends, or begins the fight by getting beat up but is able to win and take his turn rescuing his friends.""

The fluffy nature of the series can be forgiven-- Percy's adventures are merely a bit of fun. However, there are some unhealthy implications to the story that make it perhaps unfit for its youngest readers. I appreciate the points made in this blog post:"
214,2,"Nah. I really tried getting into this, but 200 pages in I just don't want to force myself through the rest. I knew the movie beforehand and thought it was entertaining if a bit mindless. I expected something alike from the book and ... I mean. It is. Kind of. The story's a bit of a mess and the parallels to Harry Potter elements are pretty obvious. Still, it could have worked. It could have been that entertaining, mindless book that I expected. (Bonus points for the Greek mythology - it really is a nice idea to get kids nowadays interested in it. And some of the ideas ARE really interesting.) But I just can't get past the writing. It's so shallow and dull and the ""funny"" lines were just incredibly forced. Being a children's/YA book is no excuse for bad writing. So nah. I'll stick to the movies."
215,2,"I enjoyed greek mythology as a child and currently studying ancient greek. You'd imagine my excitement upon stumbling this book. Sadly, I had been disappointed. This book diluted the richness of Greek mythology to that of a vapid sink water. The first few chapters were somewhat tolerable, though I did not enjoy the fast paced development, if I could even call it that, of the starting point that would eventually lead percy's discovery of his true self.

I just did not enjoy this book. I felt inclined to like it at the very least considering its popularity and a very favored theme of mine but I ended up rolling my eyes a lot and deciding not to get on with the other books of the series.

The two stars are for percy's mother who had the character of a goddess herself, a self-sacrificing woman who loved her son more than herself."
216,2,"It was quite confusing for me. I didn't have too much knowledge about Gods. I also took time longer than I expected. Bored. At the same time, I was really busy at campus. But I continued read it day by day. Slowly I found how I enjoy this book. Funny enough.

I passed many paragraphs, actually :P

My favorite part is when they stay at Las Vegas. I can't imagine that games made people forget anything. I am not such a gamers or something, so I didn't know well.

The thing that I love from this book is the ending. It was really awesome to put a clue about the next story there. I was so excited! But I don't think to read the second book.

The review copied from my own blog"
217,2,"Because my kids wanted to watch the movies (and we have a rule in our house that the book must be read, first, if there is one), I was coerced into picking this up.

Badly written, the characters have NO redeeming qualities, and are either apathetic, belligerent, or sniveling. The plot is contrived, and I had the 'betrayer' pegged the minute the Oracle prophesied to that end. Makes for a crap read.

Half of the action is just ridiculous - a gift store still fully stocked in an abandoned amusement park? A hotel that has NOTHING to do with mythology that traps people there forever? To what end? And why would they give the kids free money like that? It made no SENSE. And I hated it.

One star for being able to spell. But wOw, did that disappoint."
218,2,"I think I’m one of the only people who didn’t really enjoy this book. It was so well written but I just could not get into it! I do not know why! I’ve read it twice and I still found it underwhelming. For a such hyped book, I wanted more depth to the characters because I just couldn’t connect to them enough to like them. Nothing against the author or people who like this book. Personally was not for me for no apparent reason. I don’t know what’s wrong with me because I just trudged through it. I wish I enjoyed it more because so many people say it’s a must read.

Update: after reading it for the 3rd time as a young adult, I still wasn’t the most interested but I definitely enjoyed it better than the last attempts."
219,2,"I realize I am not the target audience for this book series, this book is clearly written for elementary/middle school aged kids. So, if you are in this bracket you can disregard my review.

Outside of the writing style being very geared toward a younger crowd, the age of Percy doesn't match the actual character and made it conflict a bit for me. The mythology was a bit misleading for a couple of the characters but I realize that you can't tell everything to kids. All of this combined made for a difficult read for me. The only thing redeeming about this book was the ending which is why it got 2 stars."
220,2,"After hearing many good things about this series, I got the boxed set with all the books in it and was eager to read it. If I had read the first one before that, I probably wouldn't have bought the set - this book was not really for me.

I felt that Percy was a really unlikeable hero, and I didn't really care about his sidekicks either. He was able to overcome all his obstacles with way too much ease. I waited for the story to get to the point where I would be completely engrossed and couldn't wait to see what came next, but that just never happened. To me, this was a children's book that does not work for adults. Had I read it as a child, I would probably have liked it better."
221,2,"So stupid. ""Hey that Harry Potter book did well, let's do something like that! But instead of a school for wizards, we'll make a camp! For uh .... Demi gods! And we'll make it educational so we'll throw in some Greek mythology"" do not waste your time. Looking for the next Harry Potter or Phillip Pullman book I found a movie script about 8 year olds killing monsters. Yes it's peppered with mythology but it has the depth and complexity of a Ninja Turtle movie. Yes I realize it's for kids. But if you're older than 10 and don't spend your time thinking about how awesome it would be to chop off monsters heads, don't bother."
222,2,"Ok, so I decided to read this book all the way through since my daughter Aly is a big fan and I know she's going to drag me to the movie next week when it comes out. I thought it had potential and I'll probably read the next few in the series just because sometimes it takes a little bit for the author to really get into the story. It was a quick read which made it much less painful and I think with some good character development this could be a good series esp for the pre-teens to early teens. I'm all for any series that gets my kids reading!"
223,2,"Eh, I don't know. I wanted to like this more. I really like the idea, but something went wrong with the execution. Percy overcame the obstacles in his way too easily, too much seemed blatantly ripped off of Harry Potter and I want to beat people who say/write ""muzak"" instead of music with large sticks.

Some of it was cute, and it's probably a nice read for people in it's intended age group, but I'd rather reread HP again than continue this series.

Also, HITLER IS THE SON OF HADES, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Just... seriously?"
224,2,"While I thought the premise was good, Greek gods are sweet, and moving them into the modern era seems like an interesting idea. I was disappointed by the execution. The characters seemed flat, as well as remarkably dim witted. The plot was very linear and and predictable. The heavy use of foreshadowing meant that the reader knew of every major plot twist before it happened. Even though I realized going in that this book was written for tweens and lowered my expectations accordingly I was still underwhelmed, especially since I have heard some high praise for this series from various sources."
225,2,"Thought I'd give this a try after watching the movie release, which I enjoyed. As a big fan of the Greek/ Roman myths I really thought this would appeal. Sadly I was disappointed. The writing style is really, REALLY hard to read (it doesn't flow well at all), which was a shame as the themes and ideas were actually pretty interesting.

The characters were also well done and the setting was consistent, though it did have its flaws. I won't be continuing the series, though, because I just can't read the staccato style."
226,2,"Diciamo due stelline e mezza, dai. Lo schema narrativo del mezzo sangue �� sempre quello senza aggiungere nulla di nuovo sotto al sole. I personaggi sono senza infamia n�� gloria, troppo poco definiti sia per amarli che per odiarli. Sai dove va a parare la storia dal primo capitolo e quelli che dovrebbero essere colpi di scena non lo sono pi�� di tanto. Tutto sommato una lettura che pu�� essere pure piacevole per passare qualche ora con qualcosa di particolarmente leggero. D���altra parte non credo che legger�� il resto della saga."
227,2,"I'm not a fan of greek mythology, however, this book did have a very good plot. It's about a boy, who is the son of Posieden, and brother to Zues. After Zues' bolt is stolen Percy sets out with his friends to find it, and return it to Zues. I gave this book a 2 stars because I didn't like the way the narration was wrote. The narrator is Percy: who is supposed to be a sixth grade boy, but the language doesn't reflect that, it makes him seem way too sophisticated. Also, I found this book to be boring way too often and I often zoned out, which doesn't happen a lot when I read."
228,2,"Its very clear that this was written for middle grade boys, but was an entertaining enough action adventure/coming of age story. I haven't thought about Greek mythology in years, but apparently know enough to follow all of the characters the children meet on their adventure and in most cases figure out who they were before Percy did. I thought that the use of several locations was quite clever, and I liked the idea that Mount Olympus moves depending on where the power of Western Civilization is.

229,2,"Allgemeines:
Percy Jackson ist eine fünfbändige Fantasy-Buchreihe des US-amerikanischen Autors Rick Riordan, welche im Carlsen Verlag erschienen ist.

Band 1: Diebe im Olymp
Band 2: Im Bann des Zyklopen
Band 3: Der Fluch des Titanen
Band 4: Die Schlacht um das Labyrinth
Band 5: Die letzte Göttin


Irgendjemand hat etwas gegen ihn, da ist sich Percy sicher. Ständig fliegt er von der Schule, immer ist er an allem schuld und dann verwandelt sich sogar seine Mathelehrerin plötzlich in eine rachsüchtige Furie. Wenig später erfährt Percy das Unglaubliche: Er ist der Sohn des Meeresgottes Poseidon - und die fiesesten Gestalten der griechischen Mythologie haben ihn ins Visier genommen! Percys einzige Chance: Er muss sich mit den anderen Halbgöttern verbünden.


Der 12-jährige Percy ist eine Demigottheit (Halbgott) und der Sohn von Poseidon, weshalb er Wasser kontrollieren kann. Er wird beschuldigt, Zeus Herrscherblitz gestohlen zu haben. Um einen Krieg unter den Göttern zu verhindern, muss er den Herrscherblitz finden und, bis zur Sommersonnenwende, in den Olymp zurückbringen.

Annabeth ist ebenfalls eine Demigottheit und die Tochter von Athene. Sie und Percy haben sich anfangs nicht sonderlich gut verstanden, doch mit der Zeit werden sie zu guten Freunden. Annabeth ist außerordentlich klug und besitzt ein grosses Wissen über Kampfkünste und griechische Sagen, was ihnen im Verlauf der Reise von grossem Nutzen ist.

Grover ist ein Satyr und Percys bester Freund. Als Hüter ist es seine Aufgabe, die Halbgötter unversehrt ins Camp Half-Blood zu bringen. Leider kam einst ein Halbgott dabei ums Leben und Grover ist seither auf Bewährung. Indem er nun Percy und Annabeth auf ihrer Reise unterstützt und ihnen hilft, erhofft er sich eine Suchlizenz, die es ihm ermöglicht, nach dem verschwundenen Naturgott Pan zu suchen.


Bisher bin ich nie über den ersten Band hinausgekommen, obwohl ich schon seit Jahren den Schuber Zuhause stehen habe. Ich habe mich im Nachhinein oft gefragt, warum das so ist. Eigentlich liebe ich die griechische Mythologie und verschlinge gerne Bücher, die damit zusammenhängen. Also habe ich mir den ersten Band nochmal zur Brust genommen und versteh nun wieder, wo mein Problem mit dem Buch liegt.

Die Idee, die griechischen Mythologie in eine moderne ""neue"" Geschichte zu verweben, finde ich großartig. Im Großen und Ganzen wurde dies auch gut umgesetzt. Nur leider gibt es vieles, was mich gestört hat.

Alles in allem hatte ich beim Lesen durchgehend das unangenehme Gefühl, dass der Autor die Geschichte so schnell wie möglich auf den Markt werfen wollte. Etwas mehr Tiefgang hätte dem Buch bestimmt nicht geschadet, denn die Geschichte war meines Erachtens nicht wirklich ausgereift. Etwas mehr Eigenleistung und mehr eigene Fantasie des Autors hätten der Geschichte sicher gutgetan. Die Erklärungen zu den Gottheiten hätte ich zudem lieber detailreicher in der Geschichte aufgenommen, anstatt im Anhang des Buches als eine Art Glossar. Gleichzeitig fand ich es trotzdem gut, dass überhaupt ein Glossar vorhanden war. Nichtsdestotrotz sollte ein Glossar niemals die Erklärungen innerhalb einer Geschichte ersetzen.

Die Überschriften der Kapitel empfand ich als absolut schrecklich. Dann doch lieber keine Überschriften, sondern nur simple Zahlen, als so etwas. Zudem legt der Autor in diesem Buch einen ziemlich heftigen Patriotismus an den Tag. Er stellt Amerika über alle anderen Nationen, sodass sogar die Götter aus Athen fliehen. Naja… Patriotismus ist ja gut und auch recht, aber es war mir stellenweise dann doch etwas zu viel.

Positiv aufgefallen ist mir, dass Percy nicht den idealen Helden porträtiert und seine eigenen kleinen Macken und Schwierigkeiten hat. Die Charaktere an sich blieben jedoch sehr oberflächlich und hatten keinen Tiefgang. Ich habe kaum Bindung zu ihnen aufgebaut, wobei Grover hier noch der interessanteste Charakter von allen war. Interessante Dialoge waren ebenfalls sehr rar gesät und Percys 0815-Sprüche fand ich so semi-lustig. Auch Percys Verhalten, als seine Mutter ""verschwindet"", hat mich mit offenem Mund und ungläubig weiterlesen lassen. Die Trauer wurde vollkommen ausgelassen, stattdessen ging es so weiter, als wäre nichts passiert.

Des Weiteren ging alles viel zu schnell. Percy und seine Freunde rutschen von einem Abenteuer in das nächste, ohne dass dabei echte Spannung aufgebaut wurde. Die Kampfszenen im Buch werden recht übereilt und einfach dargestellt. Percy gewinnt jeden Kampf locker und ohne Probleme. Er ist zwar ein Halbgott, was natürlich übermenschliche Fähigkeiten mit sich bringt, aber er hat trotzdem kaum Kampferfahrung. Dennoch gelingt ihm alles viel zu schnell und viel zu einfach und er besiegt sogar Ares, den Gott des Krieges, problemlos. Das ist einfach nicht realistisch…

Unter anderem gab es auch Fehler im Lektorat – zum Beispiel hieß Annabeth plötzlich Annabell. Solche Fehler müssten eigentlich in einem Lektorat behoben werden.

Der Schreibstil an sich ist locker und leicht.


Die Reihe um Percy Jackson hat noch deutlich Luft nach oben und ich hoffe, dass der Autor das Potenzial noch ausschöpfen wird.

Für Kinder ist es bestimmt ein hervorragendes Buch, zumal sie hier auch in die griechische Mythologie eingeführt werden.

Obwohl mich das Buch etwas ernüchtert zurücklässt, werde ich dem zweiten Band diesmal bestimmt eine Chance geben.


2.5 von 5 Sterne"
230,2,"What I liked about this book is how it gave a positive spin to ADHD and dyslexia. All disorders are on a spectrum and offer coping benefits of one type or another, this book did a great job of giving a creative meaning to these challenges.

What I didn't like was that it was a total Harry Potter rip off. Even the boy/girl ratio, the different ""houses"", the age and on and on. These overlaps were distracting, if not irritating."
231,2,"Very lackluster plot that feels like a rip-off of Harry Potter and others of the fantasy genre. It is, however, an easy way to introduce Greek Mythology to children. I'm also tiring of the child who possesses magic and/or special gifts. What's wrong with having to work hard to hone your talent? That said, I'd recommend this for the reluctant reader or for the braniac who needs a bit of fluff. Michael gives it 5 stars."
232,2,
233,2,"I get aggravated by ‘retellings’ of Greek mythology. I’m going to sound like an old fart, but the original is always infinitely wiser, deeper and more interesting and more layered. Turning the tales that are the foundation of our civilization into meaningless, senseless action hero entertainment for teenagers sets my teeth on edge.

So you had ambrosia and you turned it to popcorn. I guess if it inspires ‘the kids’ to read, it’s a win. *Shrugs in grumpy"
234,2,"The Percy Jackson series were a huge love of mine the first time I read them and got me really interested in Greek mythology, so much so that I took classics A level!

Unfortunately, doing this has made me despise them, however much I wish I didn't, I just can't over look all of the faults!

I won't spoil it for you, but if you know anything about Greek literature, culture and mythology, you would never look at these books the same again :("
235,2,"The comparisons to Harry Potter are plentiful, and there were more than a few scenes where I wondered how this was not outright intellectual thievery from JK Rowling. Regardless, it was stupid, mindless fun. I don't think I can be bothered to read the others in the series, nor do I think it would be a worthwhile venture to do so. This insipid little piece of ridiculous will do just fine. 2.5 stars."
236,2,"This book is always a mixed bag for me. Truthfully, it was always just ""okay"". I have taught it multiple times and tried to change up the format in which it is read, but haven't really enjoyed the story. I do know my students love it! I prefer later novels in the Percy Jackson series over this one and I also really enjoy the movie adaptation but there is something about the way that this book is written that I just cannot put my finger on."
237,2,"Not horrible, but what a Harry Potter ripoff. It's all there...a bumbling boy sidekick, a brainy girl, a reluctant hero. House rivalries. Help from beyond the grave from a parent. Exchange magic for demi-god abilities. A dark lord returning to power. He even has to go live in the ""real world"" for part of the year. Sigh."
238,2,"I know this is just a fictional story and I shouldn't be so fussy, but here are my biggest issues:
1. Athena was a virgin goddess - there's no way she has little heroes running about Earth!
2. Hades wasn't any more villainous than the other gods. The Underworld/Hades is NOT hell (that's some place later religions came up with).
3. The plot makes very little sense."
239,2,"This is one of these cases where movie actually is better - more illustrating and fascinating than book. Book is not bad, but you just try to compare it with movie while reading and flick comes out winner most of the times. Also too much craving for coca-cola and junk food for my taste. Idea is good, but characters are too shallow."
240,2,"Me ha dejado mucho a desear, no es nada de lo que esperaba, no me dieron gracia ninguno de los personajes que son bastante cliché y no tienen nada de profundidad.

Estoy totalmente decepcionada porque esperaba bastante de Rick Riordan."
241,2,"While the Greek Mythology part was interesting and novel , some elements of the book were so reminiscent of the Harry Potter series , it kinda destroyed my enjoyment of it. But I will pick up the rest of the series as I do wanna know what happens to Grover and Knonos and of course Percy n Anna. 2.5 stars from an adult reader who adores Harry Potter n Narnia."
242,2,"This has been on my to-read-list forever, but man, what a disappointment. Very disjointed story of one event after another with no real risk because you know Percy isn't going to die. I get that it was supposed to mimic Greek myth quest stories, but they are all so rushed at silly that they don't work for me.
I'm taking the rest of the series off my list."
243,2,"2,5⭐️ li a muuuuito tempo e na época fez sentido por conta da minha idade e do personagem, entendo quem goste mesmo mais velho, porém, comigo não funcionou. gosto da ideia da mitologia e tudo mais só que além de não me conectar já vi o filme e esperava alguns acontecimentos que vieram. de qualquer jeito, reconheço que não é ruim e entendo quem gosta mas comigo não funcionou :("
244,2,I don't know how I felt after reading this book....it's just I chose this book for time-pass and it indeed was a great time-pass but I didn't like this book very much. I would have liked it few years back when I was like 10 or 9 maybe...but not this year. It was childish. For me I mean. I still ended up reading the full series...for time-pass.
245,2,"I've waffled back and forth between 2 and 3 stars, but decided on 3 because if my sons were reviewing it they'd give it 5 stars. They love these books and I can see why. Percy is an appealing character and Riordan writes with lots of energy.

The pink poodle was hard to take though."
246,2,"While it pleases me to no end to see the greek myths taking off and entering the young minds of its target demographic, the quality of writing brought this rating down for me. The modern day depictions of the gods are just accurate enough to hold my interest in this series."
247,2,"I tried to like it, but in the end it was too predictable since I'm familiar with the originals and abridged versions like Bullfinch. I can see why the series is popular; they are interesting stories retold in the vernacular."
248,2,"This book isn’t boring, but what was the point of making Percy go through all those obstacles? He overcomes them easily, doesn’t learn much from them and, in the end, the obstacles have very little relevance to the main plot."
249,2,"Dette var en spennende bok og bokem var skrevet godt - men jeg ikke likte tanken å bruke greske gudene i fantasien og filosofien om den ""vestern verden"" som er bedre enn alle andre, i hvert fall tolket jeg den slik."
250,2,"شاید اگه اینو تو ۱۰ سالگی می‌خوندم، خیلی باهاش حال می‌کردم ولی به درد الانم نمی‌خوره متأسفانه. اما از ایده‌ی اصلی کتاب خیلی خوشم اومد:
اینکه خواننده با ایزدان یونان باستان در قالب یه رمان تخیلی آشنایی پیدا می‌کنه و اصلاً دلیل اینکه سراغش رفتم هم همین بود. در کل همونطور که گفتم مناسب سنم نبود.
۲/۵⭐️"
251,2,Märks att jag har blivit äldre sedan jag sist läste boken första gången. Den är bra men inte en favorit. För lite kärlek för min smak men bra för att glömma verkligheten en stund. Kommer förmodligen läsa tvåan innan jag bestämmer mig för om jag ska fortsätta med serien.
252,2,"If only I had read this one as a teenager, I would probably have liked it. But at twenty one, I don't. A bunch of twelve year olds talking back to g o d s and saving the world i just... can't picture it. I can't. T w e l v e year olds!!!"
253,2,"Complete Harry Potter rip off, never enough explanation, moves way to fast and random plot points show up with now need or meaning. Like the casino? Totally just a desperate attempt to shorten the deadline. Lol not reading the rest"
254,2,"In this millenium, Mt Olympus is in the Empire State Building and Hades is in an LA recording studio."
255,2,"I read this book for school, and i didn't really like it. It's about a boy who fights monsters with weird creatures, and he goes to a special camp, and it's just really weird."
256,2,"I can totally see that kids would love this book... me... eh, it was ok. I struggled to get through it. I actually liked the movie better. Go figure."
257,2,"I liked this book better the first time, when it was called Harry Potter. Hey-oh!"
258,2,"Interesting ideas...but terribly written. It's worse than reading a comic book, or somebody's play-by-by of a movie they've seen."
259,2,"Hmmm... I didn't know ancient Greeks talked like that. :/ The story is ok, but the characters just ruined it for me."
260,2,"Update 18 Feb '15
In hindsight, it was just okay.

Just stopped short of four stars. I blame the movie."
261,2,Second time reading. I just...really don't like this book.
262,2,Review to come.
263,2,I think I'm too old for this series. I was just annoyed with all of them the whole time.
264,2,"4.5
I can't wait to get to the second book!"
265,2,"This book isn't that good because it was really unrealistic and boring. But there were some good parts in the book that made the book from zero stars, to two stars."
266,2,"Not my cup of tea, but totally get why it's so popular at school.
Also my rating is possibly a case of wrong book at the wrong time."
267,2,Just not for me. I found the characters annoying and the twists on the myths not enjoyable. I'll probably skip Rick Riordan from now on.
268,2,"Creative story, dull writing. Great for kids…not interesting enough for adults."
269,2,"just couldn't get into this for some reason, don't think I will continue the series"
270,2,Meeeeeeeh. It's just poorly written Harry Potter meets Greek mythology. A great idea but too boring to finish.
271,2,Beautiful illustrations!
272,2,"I know it is for kids, but it is pretty predictable."
273,2,"I was super exited to read this one, it's highly recommended but I relized that ı was too old to read it. EVerything sounded super childish, I couldn't get the willies more!"
274,2,k
275,2,This was okay. My 9 year old really enjoyed it and it was fun to have a modern story mixed with mythology but I didn't love it.
276,2,Meh.
277,2,I don’t even remember when I read this - certainly a few years ago. But I won’t ever reread it. Not recommended.
278,2,"My 9-year-old enjoyed it enough to jump into the second book right away. I didn't think it was anything special but I didn't mind reading it, either."
279,2,"Not....a big fan. It was my first time reading so maybe the lack of nostalgia glasses made me more critical, but I don't know if I will continue at all."
280,2,cute af
281,2,"brooo, this book is so overrated, it was fun? but even annabeth is dumb, soo..."
282,2,Voice is way too American
283,2,"English Review:
This book was my first audio book and on account of that it can also be possible that my opinion has shifted in some way about this book or was changed. At the beginning I thought that my‚ experiment – the first audio book‘, and that listening to someone who is reading the book, is exciting. Furthermore, it was particularly funny when the speaker tried to sound different in the dialogs with every new character which appeared.
Hence, as mentioned above I was enthusiastic at the beginning by this ‘new‘kind of going through a book. But soon this first curiosity faded and it started to annoy me for example that the speaker shifted his voice over and over again in such a childish way. Moreover, because of the listening to the book I felt much less involved in the story and in the plot, than it would have been if I had read it by myself. On top of that comes that I’ve listened to the audio book just seldom, because I am, nevertheless, rather a person who prefers listen to music while going to work or while jogging – and also while this exercises I had to concentrate too hard not to miss anything and get all that happens in the book. As a summary I can say that my first attempt with an audio book hasn’t really succeeded. I’ve expected more and would have hoped for more passion at my part, but unfortunately, this wasn’t the case and now I consider and ask myself whether I should leave audio books be or if I should try at a later time with another series once again. The time will show it, but at the moment I remain with reading the books by myself.

Now to the actual story of Percy Jackson, for which I’ve also had high expectations because of the great resonance around these books and also of the other members of the book forum, where I’m part of. Unfortunately, I was also disappointed concerning the contents of this book.
Though there were no serious mistakes which startled me or disturbed me intensely, but parts of the plot or of the characters haven’t worked right for me. From the beginning, I immediately felt that it’ about a children’s book, which would haven’t disturbed me further, because I’m also a big fan of Harry Potter and these were at the beginning of the series also children’s books. But here in Percy Jackson’s case, some things in the storyline and some thoughts of Percy weren’t coherent in my opinion.
Percy Jackson is a 12-year-old boy who experiences some unnatural things, until it’s revealed to him that he is a demigod and he’s also accused of being the thief of Zeus’s lightning bolt. The next things which are happening in the story or particularly how Percy reacts on them or also the other characters, are not quite realistic and are shown too heroically, as that it fits to a young lad, even if he’s full courage and pure heart. It was simply too exaggerated and unbelievable and which let me roll my eyes from time to time.

Also I didn’t found one character in the book which was really likeable or which let me worry for them much. For example Grover was for me not an amusing companion which should lighten the mood of the story, but he rather was a little bit annoying and too afraid and Annabeth was also not a very winning over character by her constant better knowledge and self-confidence. The plot, apart from the characters, was okay but hasn’t moved me in the way other books did or it wasn’t so exciting that I couldn’t put it away. Now it’s hard for me to say where the reason for that lies. Although I really try to stay objective, I think that it’s cased partially also because of using the audio book. Parts of the storyline were really interesting and I wanted to hear more, others were sucked from the fingers to pull the plot in the length.

Unhappily, the end was also not so good either and because of that I had to decrease my review points further down. Although I was surprised at the end when I got to know who really was the traitor in the whole story, there were still two or three things in it which I didn’t like very much. The most serious point was the letter to Percy from his mother, where she described how she has got rid of her boyfriend. I don’t know how someone can write such a thing in a children’s book? In a book where it is about heroism and morality, in the end it is virtually shown how the mother of the hero used the head of Medusa on her boyfriend and his buddies to transform them into stone. Not only that she has killed people with that, she has also shown an irreparable weakness. Which good characters would rather kill their enemies or somebody else to get away from, instead of pulling themselves together and show strength and face them, without murdering someone!? Moreover, especially unbelievable was the fact that there was also written that she has sold this‚ ‘stone sculptures’ for a lot of money. At first she murdered somebody and afterwards she also got a great benefit out of their death? Wow, I think it couldn’t be worse or more mean.
I am sorry, but I think that I need a longer break now before I’ll pick up the second book in this series and when it’s so far, then I’ll read it by myself and refuse to use an audio book.

Dieses Buch ist mein erstes Audio Buch gewesen und aufgrund dessen kann es auch sein, dass meine Meinung zu diesem Buch etwas verschoben oder verändert wurde.
Zu Beginn fand ich das ‚Experiment – erstes Audio Buch‘ und das Zuhören, wie ein anderer das Buch vorliest spannend. Außerdem empfand ich es besonders witzig, wie der Redner versucht hat bei jedem neuen Charakter seine Stimme anders klingen zu lassen.
Wie oben erwähnt war ich daher besonders am Anfang sehr angetan von dieser ‚neuen‘ Art ein Buch präsentiert zu bekommen. Aber schon bald verblich diese erste Begeisterung und es fing an mich zb. zu nerven, dass der Redner immer wieder so kindisch seine Stimme verstellte. Außerdem fühlte ich mich durch das Zuhören des Textes viel weniger in die Geschichte versetzt, als wenn ich es selbst gelesen hätte. Noch dazu kommt, dass ich selten das Buch gehört habe, da ich doch eher der Mensch bin, der Musik bevorzugt, wenn er zur Arbeit geht oder sich beim Laufen abrackert – bei diesen Dingen muss man sich ansonsten zu sehr auf den vorgelesenen Text konzentrieren um nicht abgelenkt zu werden und alles mitzubekommen. Als Resümee kann ich sagen, dass mein erster Versuch mit einem Audiobuch nicht wirklich geklappt hat. Ich hätte mir mehr erwartet und mir mehr Begeisterung meinerseits erhofft, aber das war leider überhaupt nicht der Fall und nun bin ich stark am überlegen, ob ich es mit den Audiobüchern ganz lassen soll oder zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt mit einer anderen Serie noch einmal probieren soll. Die Zeit wird es weisen, aber momentan bleibe ich wieder beim selber lesen.

Nun zur eigentlichen Geschichte von Percy Jackson, auf die ich ebenfalls hohe Stücke gesetzt habe, da die Begeisterung rund um diese Bücher von den anderen Mitgliedern des Bücherforums sehr groß war. Doch leider wurde ich auch inhaltlich von diesem Buch enttäuscht. Es gab zwar keine gravierenden Fehler, die mich aufschrecken ließen oder mich besonders intensiv gestört hätten, aber für mich haben Teile der Handlung bzw. die Charaktere nicht ganz funktioniert. Man spürt gleich von Beginn, dass es sich um ein Kinderbuch handelt, was mich nicht weiter gestört hätte, da ich ebenfalls ein großer Harry Potter Fan bin und diese zu Beginn auch Kinderbücher sind. Aber hier waren einige Handlungen und Gedanken für mich nicht stimmig.
Percy Jackson ist ein zwölfjähriger Junge, der einige unnatürliche Dinge erlebt, bis ihm offenbart wird, dass er ein Halbgott ist und beschuldigt wird den Herrscherblitz von Zeus gestohlen zu haben. Die darauffolgenden Dinge die in der Geschichte passieren und besonders wie Percy darauf reagiert oder auch die anderen Charaktere, sind für mich nicht ganz realistisch und zu heldenhaft dargestellt, als dass es zu einem jungen Knaben passt, auch wenn er voller Mut und reinem Herzens ist. Es war zu übertrieben und unglaublich und hat mich öfters mit den Augen rollen lassen.
Auch fand ich im Buch keinen Charakter der mir wirklich besonders sympathisch war oder der mich dazu gebracht hätte mit ihnen zu bangen. Grover war für mich leider kein lustiger Weggefährte, der die Stimmung aufhellen sollte, sondern eher etwas nervig und ängstlich und Annabeth war durch ihr Besserwissen und Selbstvertrauen auch nicht sehr einnehmend.
Die Handlung, abgesehen von den Charakteren, war okay, hat mich aber ebenfalls nicht sonderlich bewegt oder mitgerissen. Aber ich kann es nun schwer beurteilen, ob dies am Buch oder am Audiobuch liegt, obwohl ich wirklich versuche objektiv zu bleiben, und nicht die ganze Schuld dem Audiobuch zu geben.
Teile davon waren wirklich interessant und ich wollte mehr hören, andere dafür waren mir wiederrum ein wenig zu sehr aus den Fingern gesaugt um die Handlung in die Länge zu ziehen.

Das Ende setzte dann leider nochmal eines drauf, was die Bewertungspunkte leider sinken ließ. Obwohl ich überrascht war, als sich heraus stellte, wer nun wirklich der Verräter in der ganzen Geschichte ist, waren trotzdem zwei, drei Dinge mit denen ich mich nicht anfreunden konnte. Der gravierendste Punkt war für mich der Brief den Percy von seiner Mutter bekommen hat, in dem sie schildert wie sie ihren Freund los geworden ist. Ich weiß nicht wie man so etwas in ein Kinderbuch schreiben kann? In einem Buch indem es um Heldentum und Moral geht, wird zum Schluss quasi gezeigt, wie die eigene Mutter des Helden den Kopf der Medusa verwendet um ihren Freund und seine Kumpels, auch wenn er böse und gemein ist und sie geschlagen hat, in Stein zu verwandeln. Nicht nur, dass sie damit Menschen getötet hat und das willentlich, hat sie auch eine irreparable Schwäche gezeigt. Welcher gute Charakter tötet lieber seine Feinde oder sonst jemanden, um von jemand los zu kommen, anstatt sich selbst zusammen zu raffen und Stärke zu zeigen und denjenigen vor die Tür zu setzen, anstatt ihn zu ermorden! Besonders schlimm fand ich es außerdem, dass danach noch geschrieben wurde, dass sie diese ‚Steinskulpturen‘ verkauft und viel Geld dafür bekommen hat. Zuerst jemanden ermorden und dann noch Geld aus dessen Tod scheffeln? Wow, ich glaube ‚schlimmer geht’s nimmer‘.
Es tut mir leid, aber ich glaube ich brauche nun eine längere Pause bevor ich den zweiten Teil anfassen werde und wenn es soweit ist, werde ich ihn mit Sicherheit selber lesen und auf ein Audiobuch verzichten.

286,2,"Un ragazzino disagiato, maltrattato in casa, dotato di poteri speciali, capelli neri, occhi verdi, straordinaria somiglianza con il padre, in costante pericolo di vita, costretto a vivere per anni nel mondo 'normale' all'oscuro della sua vera natura così da essere meglio protetto...
I suoi due amici: un tipetto imbranatello e un po' fifone ma fedele e valoroso al momento opportuno; una saputella un po' arrogante ma dal gran cuore e dalla mente brillante...
Un luogo magico ed inaccessibile alla gente 'normale' in cui si istruiscono e addestrano ragazzini dai poteri speciali, popolato da curiosi personaggi e strane creature, organizzato in Case in competizione tra loro...
Un oscuro e potentissimo supercattivo, da tempo ritenuto sconfitto e scomparso di scena, tenta di risorgere e riconquistare il potere perduto...
Di cosa sto parlando? Ma di ovviamente! Chi di voi stava per dire !? Vergogna, cattivoni malfidenti... XD Solo perchè la descrizione del giovane Percy combacia con quella di Harry? Solo perchè Grover e Annabeth sono il riflesso di Ron e Hermione? Solo perchè Crono ha studiato sul manuale di Voldemort? Solo perchè il Campo Mezzosangue è la versione estiva di Hogwarts? Solo perchè Dioniso ha pagato una royalty a Snape per usare la sua battuta """"? Solo perchè l'Oracolo segue la moda lanciata dalla veggente Sybill Trelawney, ossia quella di abitare all'ultimo piano della scuola/campo, in una stanza accessibile solo attravero una botola? Solo perchè tra mortale e babbano, alla fine, c'è poca differenza? Solo perchè Percy e Harry hanno la stessa sfortuna di essere in collegamento onirico con la mente del supercattivo, e vedono in sogno eventi reali e funesti invece di essere liberi di sognare Belén Rodrìguez in santa pace? Solo perchè il berretto dell'invisibilità è la versione uso-singolo e moderna del mantello? Solo perchè Cerbero, come suo fratello Fluffy, si trova a guardia di un ingresso e può essere facilmente placato con un trucchetto da nulla? Solo perchè sia Percy che Harry hanno sulle loro spalle una profezia circa il loro destino e lo scontro finale con il supercattivo, e i rispettivi mentori Chirone e Dumbledore non intendono rivelargliela per tirmore di influenzarli negativamente? Ma andiamo, cosa andate a pensare...! XD
Fuor di battuta, diciamo che HP e PJ, caratterialmente non potrebbero essere in realtà più diversi: Harry è insicuro, confuso, quasi spaurito e magari un po' stupidotto, logicamente ignora molte cose del mondo magico in cui è stato improvvisamente catapultato, e si vede; Percy è dubbioso, sarcastico, ha l'aria da vissuto, cerca sempre di prendere in mano la situazione, dimostra una conoscenza mitologica insospettabile (riconosce a menadito creature e divinità con estrema facilità per essere un ragazzino americano del XXI Secolo), si muove con una disinvoltura sorprendente nel mondo olimpico pur essendovi giunto solo da pochi giorni, e non ha paura di confrontarsi con divinità dai poteri inimmaginabili.
Le situazioni ai limiti dell'assurdo si sprecano: dall'assai poco convincente spiegazione sul perchè l'Olimpo e le creature mitologiche classiche si trovino negli USA, alla lezioncina ambientalista di Grover, al griffatissimo Caronte, agli dei che si lamentano di continuo delle spese e dei costi (per non parlare di Ade che si lagna del traffico causato dalla pletora di morti che affolla il suo regno e della quantità di personale necessaria per gestirli), alle rocambolesche vittorie di Percy su mostri e dei, ecc. Decisioni fondamentali vengono prese con una leggerezza esasperante, tutto succede perchè deve succedere, in perfetto stile .
La trama, pur essendo molto superficiale, è eccessivamente fitta di eventi, e la folla di mostri e nemici che Percy&Co. si trovano di volta in volta ad affrontare nel giro di poche pagine è decisamente esagerata per un solo libro, neanche si trattasse dei livelli di un videogioco.
La narrazione in prima persona, ricca di anticipazioni e considerazioni a posteriori, priva la storia di pathos e, alla lunga, risulta anche irritante.
Due stellette e mezza, date più sulla fiducia in un possibile miglioramento (e in un auspicabile distacco da HP) nei successivi capitoli della serie, che per meriti effettivi. Decisamente non mi ha coinvolto.

PICCOLA OSSERVAZIONE STUPIDA: Avete notato? Il figlio di Hermes si chiama Luke, e ha delle scarpe alate che gli permettono di volare, quindi di 'camminare nel cielo', per così dire. Ora, sky in inglese significa cielo, e walk significa camminare; quindi Luke 'che cammina nel cielo' è...!! XD ..."
287,2,"As I was growing up, Percy Jackson was a popular series among my friends and the hype escalated with the movies. I only heard good things about the books everywhere I went and even watched the second movie, on the premiere, with my best friends - not knowing a single thing about anything! I don't usually follow literary trends so I'm always late for the party (e. g. I only read HP in my senior year at high school) that's why it took me a decade to finally put my hands in this book, and solely because a friend insisted and borrowed me the entire series. Needless to say, I expected great things from this book but, dear Lord... I left so, disappointed. I can't believe it has such a high average rating on this website...

To be fair, before I begin, I want to say this: the story itself is good. Greek mythology meets the modern world. Teenagers with superpowers, children from Gods and Goddess, who live in a Training Camp and go on the wildest adventures. Also, all the mythology references are very entertaining! I'm not familiar with Greek mythology to catch them all, but the ones I did, I enjoyed. The world-building is cool. It's very interesting.

My problem lays with his writing: shallow characters, bad dialogue, vague descriptions, awful suspense and cliffhangers, extremely predictable plot full of clichés, unfunny jokes, weak display of emotions, and honestly Percy is so dull! I think he's the worse written character I remember ever reading in a book. He tried to make him sound witty and ""different"" from the others, like wow, look at our protagonist, how relatable he is. That's why he's the ""chosen one"". It felt SO forced.

So many things didn't make sense and annoyed me in his character. He finds out his father is literally a GOD, he has powers, there's a magic world in parallel with ours with mythical beings and monsters, his best friend is a Satyr, his teacher is a Centaur, and best of all, he is not like people liked to point out... and every opportunity he has, he acts condescendingly and skeptical, even though miracles appear in front of his eyes literally every second. That's the coolest thing to ever happen to someone ever and he takes them for granted. If I were him, I'd want to learn everything I could and explore my powers at max. It's like finding Willy Wonka's golden ticket and putting it in the back pocket of your jeans, crumpling it up.

Also, he survives a car crash and expresses nothing more than ""Ouch"". Or a minotaur supposedly killing his mother in front of him and him having fun the next day getting to know the camp. Almost no depth at how his physical and mental pain is eating him alive (as it should). I mean, he's a 12-year-old for god sake! A child!! He should be shitting his pants and crying himself to sleep!! But he shrugs it like bad luck and moves on like nothing happened.

The time skips were so difficult to handle, too. On the left page they were in an intense fight with a monster, in the right page they were already on a bus going somewhere and chatting normally.

And he always pauses the narrative. No depth in his descriptions, or emotions in a scene. Just plain phrases with action, like this: Percy went ahead and told Annabeth this. Annabeth was angry. Said this. Then Percy talked to Grover. Grover was upset. *Insert shallow dialogue*. Percy thought Grover was right. Percy thinks a clever but unfunny joke, trying to be witty. End of chapter.

Honestly, to me, it felt like it was his first time writing a book. It felt inexperient, to say the least. I read lots of fanfiction online and his writing reminded me a lot of them... It's aimed at children of course, but I'd dare say for children that are starting to develop a taste for books with not much experience in reading. I don't know how one can go from reading something like Harry Potter (that people love to compare with PJ, and even though they have similar tropes, one has nothing to do with the other) and then read Percy Jackson and *really* enjoy the ride. If you did it as a child/teenager, it's comprehensible though, but as an adult with experience in reading, I can't even imagine...

Yet, for as ironic and hypocritical as it may sound, I'm still willing to give the series a second try. I decided to read the second book, Sea of Monsters, because, putting aside the writing, as I said, I enjoyed the plot. I think it has potential, and I want to believe that Riordan's storytelling may eventually improve. I hope so. Otherwise, I'll have to wait for the tv series's release.

That's it - End of review."
288,2,"I don't want my 2 star rating to be seen as terrible.... it was ok. Just ok. Ordinarily I would probably give it closer to a 3 star but I gave the first two Harry Potters a 2 star rating and they were better than this book and I cannot be bothered to go back and revise everything.

I am obviously not the target audience for this book and I am sure it would have been more enjoyable if I was younger.

First, this book borrows a lot from Harry Potter in my opinion -

That said, it is not a bad formula and it is somewhat interesting anyway. I may even listen to the next ones when I find myself bored in the car.

I did find myself getting very annoyed with the characters at times, I found some of their interactions and behaviors unrealistic for kids. I also found the gods to be unrealistically childish in some ways, though I will admit that at least this has some basis in the Greek myths.

I think the ""names have power"" thing doesn't really work well for this book. It works ok for Voldemort to be ""he who must not be named"", but when you are trying not to say the names of several gods, it starts to become difficult to follow a conversation. Consequently, the author had to have the characters use the gods' names several times and it was very inconsistent as to whether or not it was dangerous or a bad idea to do so. Apparently when you mention a name, the god would have a better chance of cuing into you and what you are saying and doing.








Honestly, some of my issues are just nit-picky. It seems like a decent choice for younger kids and early teens who are interested in fantasy series."

Ce lo avete chiesto in tanti! In particolare l’utente @cabin_13 su Wattpad, che vogliamo citare fra tutti perché… così, a caso. Giusto per dire il nome di uno di voi, amatissimi lettori!
Stiamo parlando di un libro che, teoricamente, è iconico… una specie di Hunger Games, di Harry Potter e la Pietra Filosofale, di Nihal della Terra del Vento (anche se quest’ultimo stona tantissimo citato nel novero, oh déi se stona! Come vedere un airone che passeggia fra le papere), insomma l’inizio di una serie mainstream per ragazzi. Una roba ossessionante, giusto? Giusto. Di quelle che quando le inizi da bambino ti risucchiano in una spirale in cui il tuo pensiero fisso è “voglio saperne di più”.
Solo che questa volta, il libro non l’abbiamo letto da ragazzi (o addirittura da bambini) e non siamo stati investiti dalla sua ondata di popolarità, quindi siamo quasi completamente esterni al suo fenomeno, e diciamo “quasi” solo perché l’abbiamo sentito citare in tv. Non è il nostro target, visto che siamo grandi. Non abbiamo neanche mai visto i film, quindi entriamo con cautela, guardandoci attorno e cercando di capire con cosa abbiamo a che fare.
La recensione di oggi sarà dedicata a Percy Jackson e il Ladro di Fulmini, il primo della serie di cinque libri dedicati tutti al nostro piccolo Percy (e agli dei dell’Olimpo), scritti dall’autore americano Rick Riordan.
Ora, germoglietti tenerini, lo sappiamo che per molti di voi questo è un libro caro al cuore e sappiate che le nostre parole non devono categoricamente farvi cambiare quello che sentite per esso, perciò vogliamo ricordarvi che la nostra recensione è estremamente personale. Sì, di solito non diciamo mai queste cose a inizio recensione, anche se sono ovvie. No, non le stiamo dicendo perché ci accingiamo a demolire il libro a colpi di palla demolitrice… ma stiamo per parlare di un libro che, da quanto ne sappiamo, ha aiutato molti bambini, ragazze e ragazzi più o meno grandi, ad accettare di più sé stessi. Stiamo parlando del primo libro di una saga che ha in sé variegata rappresentazione e che per forza di cose può dare a molti una sensazione di appartenenza, perciò parliamo di qualcosa di delicato e non possiamo direttamente buttarci, con la ruvidezza che ci contraddistingue.
Noi analizziamo tutto in base ai nostri, e solo ai nostri, gusti personali.
Quindi, sia che amiate Percy Jackson e il Ladro di Fulmini, sia che lo troviate un libro superficiale e infantile, buttatevi insieme a noi e fatevi quattro risate con la nostra ironica recensione spinosa ;)


1. La trama
Il nostro protagonista è Percy Jackson, un ragazzino di dodici anni che vive a New York con la madre Sally. Suo papà non si sa chi cavolo possa essere, perché come nella più cliché delle storie sugli orfani, la mamma non fa altro che dirgli cose tipo “Ah, era bello” “Ah, era bravo” “Ah, somigliava a te” oppure “Ah, è sparito per sempre, disperso in mare”. Normale no? A giudicare dalle ventordicimila opere incentrate su ragazzi che hanno padri importanti e misteriosi, sì.
Quindi, cosa rende il nostro piccolo Percy, ragazzino bianco con capelli scuri, unico? Cosa lo distingue da tutti gli altri undicenni/dodicenni prescelti e fra loro completamente identici?

290,2,"Maybe a 2.5 star effort for being a quick read and ending well. But I mean...REALLY?! I obviously didn't come to this book at the right age. Maybe had it existed and I had read it as a 10 or 12-year-old kid I might have liked it, but now at 32 it just isn't that great. Don't get me wrong, I like YA fiction/fantasy and I can be forgiving on some weak plot points, forced romance and cheesy dialog, but this pushed too many buttons. For instance, if you're going to have rules that your world abides by, make sure the world abides by them. Why does Chiron and Grover and Annabeth and everybody tell Percy that humans won't see the monsters because of some kind of fog and then in the St. Louis arch everyone can see the giant Chihuahua? Or Percy's sword? And then why are the swords during the fight with Ares seen as guns? Why does Grover tell Percy he literally can't lose his sword, but then he does when it falls into the river - why have that be a thing at all if it is never used? Checkov's rule about a gun in the first act going off in the third applies here. Also, why does everyone who knows stuff about Percy's destiny not tell him anything?! It's so stupid to have a prophecy that is purposefully vague and Percy ask people direct questions about them and they just simply don't answer, it's a gimmick and I hate it. The twists and betrayals are broadcast loudly and clearly and there were very few surprises.

But of all my gripes my biggest are plotting and story, the basic tenants of writing no matter what the genre or intended age group. Nothing, NOTHING, happens in this book based on Percy's choices. Everything happens TO him, he makes NO decisions. He gets a quest and gets on a bus - there's some Fates to fight. They get off the bus and happen to be right at Medusa's lair, they fight her. They go to the St. Louis arch (not because of a choice having to do with their quest, mind you, but because Annabeth likes architecture - or something?) and some giant dog attacks them. They get dropped off in Las Vegas and happen to end up right in front of the Lotus Hotel. And on, and on, and on. I hate to make comparisons to other works, but...Harry Potter (far from perfect, but EONS ahead of this) at least makes choices. He investigates, figures out, make mistakes and then sneaks of his dormitory and DOES STUFF! Make a choice, Percy!

Anyway, I MIGHT read the next one only because it ends with a cliff hanger and I'm a glutton for punishment and these books are quick reads and maybe things get better. I didn't even cover most of my grievances (NO chemistry amongst Ron, Harry and Herm... I mean Percy, Grover, and Annabeth; overly used trope of normal - to the point of obscure - child who is actually...Super powerful and all knowing [turns out your ADHD and dyslexia just means you're a super awesome warrior and can read Greek]; openly aping HP - ""Our new celebrity"", can speak to animals, etc.; inconsistent powers - water heals you, except when it can't, hey you can speak to horses; and on, and on, and on) so who knows if I will actually get around to the others."
291,2,"Let’s just establish this first. The book was way better than the movie. Yes, many rather cliché elements which I often see when jumping on the whole adventure-fantasy-one-hero bandwagon surfaced again. But, no one prepared me for the level of sassiness I would witness. When I meant humour me, Percy and Annabeth really lived up in those aspects, the magic of which was really lost on me in the movie.

Just for the sake of reminiscing, here’s the compiled list of some of the witty comebacks and moments where they’re just full on roasting each other:






Or my favourite one really:



However, I do feel like all good things always come to an end. Jokes aside (pun not intended), there was very little substance to the plot. The infusing of Greek mythology has traditionally always been cool, but the whole embarking-on-an-across-the-country-trip lacked the action I was really there for. It does get too predictable as well when Percy faces insurmountable obstacles and just miraculously subdues and defeats everything that comes his way.

The chemistry?? Super ehhh. It’s like some replicate of a high-school trio where Percy is the hotshot superstar who’s always thrusted into the limelight, Annabeth is some nerdy-badass stereotype and Grover is the third-wheeling friend who is occasionally forgotten—at least I know that I do (definitely reminds me of certain somebodies from a certain wizarding world).

And Percy? Our everyday hero parading around with his intimidating ballpoint pen is like one of the numbest (or simply emotionless) characters I’ve ever seen. He mutilates his own teacher and brushes it off as hallucinations; sees his mother vapourise into nonexistence like it happens everyday; eagerly accepts a quests of which he has prepared for for mere days and faces death like it’s nobody’s business. I think we need to give the boy an award because the countless times he’s gone into battle, come out unscathed and anticipates the next time he can have yet another near-death experience is unbeatable.

One last point (I promise I’ll stop after this) was the sad lack of death in this book (that’s right, your favourite sadist is back and she’s thirsting for more). I won’t spoil too much but the gore and suffering and bloodthirst was pathetic. It’s almost like all the demigods are immortal and Percy is some irritating bug that won’t die no matter how many times I squash it.

I was expecting a lot more from how much hype this series was getting but judging from the content of the movie, my expectations had literally hit rock bottom. Sad to say I did not like it as much as I thought I would."
292,2,"I’ve always been a big advocate of differentiating a story “made for kids” from a story “appropriate for kids”. Younger characters, accessible themes and tone doesn’t necessarily make the literature childish. Well, this book is made for kids.

I’ll start with the main and unfortunately only good aspect of this for me. The premise and worldbuilding is indeed entertaining. Not solid, not clever, but interesting. I’d love to read the version of this book with more depth put into it because there is so much fun to be had in this world.

The modern characterization of Greek legends is insanely fun. If you were to write Dionysius in present day US, a grumpy alcohol deprived old man wearing Hawaiian shirt is absolutely the way to do it. Camp Half Blood seems like a place taken out directly from my middle grade dreams. I love camping vibes and matching that to a fantasy setting is a delight to read. Unfortunately, we barely got to spend 90 pages hanging in the camp before leaving and the book only went downhill from there on.

The plot is absurdly silly. Percy encounters and defeats all the most powerful monsters in history in the most convenient and dumb ways possible. He defeats his old math teacher fury twice, the exact same way. At one point they passed through Cerberus literally throwing a rubber ball at him. That’s Dora the Explorer level of adventure. Also, ADHD and Dyslexia are symptoms of demigod powers? Really?

At some point I stopped trying to keep track of the whole lore and motivations since everything in this world is explained by “A god did it”. Which I guess is appropriate to the level of logic and complexity of the original Greek mythos, but it's still not great storytelling.

By far my biggest issue with this book is the characters. They all sound like they were written by Dan Schneider for a Nickelodeon sitcom. Literally in every dialogue Percy drops some edgy ironical comment that’s painfully unfunny. They are so unserious all the time. I could almost hear the laugh tracks every time Groover had a completely out of tone dumb line in the middle of a scene. Speaking of which, Groover and Annabeth have the personality of a paperclip. Why are they even here? Heroes’ parties are made of trios and satyrs must protect their heroes despite being way weaker than a demigod because… a god said it, I guess. I’m sure this choice of characters has nothing to do with a certain wizard novel.

I’ll be picking up the second book eventually out of pure curiosity. In the first book already, Percy has done more than any other Greek hero, defeating almost all the famous monsters, escaping the underworld and evenly matching the god of war in a duel. And we still have five more books in this saga alone? Is there even that many Greek legends? I just hope the writing matures a little along the way otherwise I’m not sure I’ll be finishing the series."
293,2,"« Un destin de héros n’est jamais heureux. Il n’est rien d’autre que tragique »

Hello hello ! Alors mon avis sur Percy Jackson (Time 1) sachant que j’ai acheté les 20, malgré cet échec, je continuerai car j’ai espoir en cette saga. Mais ce premier tome ne m’a pas du tout convaincu. Je sais que de base c’est adressé à un publique jeune. Mais vu le nombre de gens idolâtrant cette saga, je pensais que même étant « presque » adulte, on pouvait y prendre du plaisir.

Je vais parler déjà des problèmes que j’ai eu avec ce tome.

1) Les facilités dans l’intrigue.

Déjà tout était beaucoup trop prévisible, surtout par rapport aux antagonistes et aux combats. Je n’ai pas eu une once d’étonnement devant ce livre. De plus le peu de fois où la situation semblait compliquée, on nous résolvait ça hyper facilement. Ça m’a frustré.

2)Les personnages.

Alors je sais, les personnages sont jeunes. Donc c’est normal si leur perception du danger ou encore leurs décisions peuvent être bancales. Mais là, la fameuse Annabeth, l’intelligente du groupe, malgré que je donne un point pour le fait qu’elle les aient parfois sorti de situations périlleuses. Elle reste vachement naïve.

3) La plume

Encore une fois, je donne une excuse à l’auteur. Je me dis vu que Percy est un pré-ado et qu’on est dans sa tête. Le style d’écriture correspond à lui. Mais ça m’a quand même pas mal dérangé. Ça restait fluide et tout je ne dis pas. Mais je trouvais l’écriture enfantine.

4) Sujets trop peu approfondis

Je radote, mais là j’ai tout de même trouvé une excuse, vu que c’est étendu sur plusieurs tomes. Les sujets peuvent être améliorés. Mais certains dont un particulièrement sur à la fin [SPOILERS] on apprend que Gaby a déjà frappé la mère De Percy. Et ce qui aurait pu laisser un sentiment de culpabilité à Percy, ou des séquelles sur sa mère. (D’ailleurs J’ai beaucoup aimé qu’à la fin il se fasse transformer en statue) bien mérité pour lui.

Bref le problème que j’ai eu avec ce livre, c’est qu’en tant que jeune fille de 17 ans qui consomme beaucoup de young-adult + fantasy. J’avais vraiment l’impression que c’était fait uniquement pour les plus jeunes.
Mais cette saga a beaucoup de potentiel. Et je vais lire le deuxième tome. Donc voilà

2 ⭐️"
294,2,"2 ★

No esperaba una trama tan juvenil. Ha sido una historia muy aventurera que aprofundiza poco en los personajes y se focaliza más en la acción.

Lo que me ha gustado han sido las primeras muestras de cariño de Annabeth hacía Percy <3



También que la mitología se presenta poco a poco. Aunque luego aparecen demasiados personajes mitológicos y ya no sabes quién es quién.

Bueno, ahora lo que no me ha gustado lol.

El libro es juvenil:
- Esto hace que no conecte mucho ni con la historia ni con los personajes. Annabeth me ha parecido más interesante que los demás, pero Percy no me ha caído bien.
- Hay mucha acción, lo que personalmente me aburre (el último libro que leí Age of Assassins sí tenía buena acción jeje).
- El ritmo al que transcurre la trama es demasiado elevado para llegar a sentirte implicado/una conexión (pero entiendo que es para un público más joven).

Usa clichés que no me gustan especialmente... 1) los sueños y 2) el elegido. Nunca en su vida ha tocado una espada y la primera vez ya se le da bien (que sea el elegido aún, pero que al menos practique un día sabes…)
Algo que me ha incomodado es que se da por hecho que los dioses no tienen autocontrol sexual.

Luego hay detalles que le hacen perder aún más puntos:
- No me gusta cómo empieza, siendo todo tan ‘secreto’. Le esconden todo a Percy y cuando empieza a conocer todo el nuevo mundo siguen ocultándole cosas… como lector no me gusta que te dejen sin explicación todo el rato.
- En un momento que están Percy, Annabeth y Grover en una misión, suben al ascensor y se separan ??? cuando tienen que proteger a Percy. La razón: ya habían entrado los dos en el ascensor, y salir para que entren otros ‘molestaría a los demás’ wtf.
- Hay escenas q no pintan nada como la del casino ??
- Incongruencias, como por ejemplo que le dicen a Percy que no diga los nombres de los dioses, y luego ellos los dicen.

Porque es Percy Jackson, si no habría abandonado la saga. La seguiré ahora y a ver qué tal."
295,2,"It was ok. I do not understand the hype at all. This was a very entertaining middle grade novel and I am definitely going to look for the other parts. However, I found it extremely hard not to get impatient with the obviousness of plot points and the time it took the main characters to become aware of what readers realise so incredibly early on, but I am sure that I am not the target audience. Still - the main character learned about Latin and Greek myths at school and still can't place any of the mythical creatures he encounters? Really? How little attention was he paying in his favourite class?
Also, the gods. Rudolf Otto, theologist, writes that holy things are regarded by humans with fascination and fear. Here, there is neither and I do not think that this helps the book. I am also not happy with the cute, pat disneyfied versions of the gods, but I don't think that most modern minds can really wrap their head around polytheism any more and thus all gods become caricatures of themselves, downplaying not only their power if they existed, but also their multifacetedness and leaving them with one aspect. Thus, Dionysus becomes the party god, Poseidon a surfer dude.
I don't like this and don't think this is necessary. If readers are to take multiple deities seriously in a book serious, they must needs be written as what they represent - eternal forces greater than mere human mortals. If Poseidon shows up in a book, he needs to be more than a surfer dude water mage. I want him to be shown as the force that inspired him in the first place - the untamable power of the ocean, pitched against which all human ingenuity and strength still strive in vain. And Dionysus cannot be the comic relief god of wine - this is only one aspect of this god of ecstasy and madness, a reminder of the frailty of human reason. I don't really see what is gained by NOT having that in this middle grade book, as writing them as what they represent surely would raise the stakes of the quest our hero undertakes."
296,2,"I'm not a child, and I didn't read this as a child, so I found this book less than exciting.

Percy is the typical ""I'm weird and bullied, but I am so AWESOME and get the coolest girl around"" young male protagonist that I find in books written by, well, males. The ""coolest girl"" is the one who can beat everyone in training/board school in 2 seconds flat but in real situations is always saved by the protagonist (damsel in distress has to play hard to get, right?). The protagonist is always clueless and isolated during training/boarding school but suddenly does something or has something happen that makes him suddenly subject to idol worship (ooooo, you're kid).

The lead-in (and the whole book for that matter) is the timeless child v. adult, where the adults get shifty and say they have to tell the kid something ""but it can wait,"" which means it's already too late and . This happens over. and over. and over. and over. and over. again in this book. I'm really sick of if.

Medusa, Echidna, Procrustes, the Lotus Hotel are haphazardly thrown in, and none of them make any sense in relation to the larger plot. I can't figure out if they're working for one of the powers-that-be, or if they're just drawn to power and want to control/destroy those who have power. All of the monster run-ins are ""whoo, rest-stop!"" moments where it screams ""OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A TRAP"" like a cheap, straight-to-VHS horror movie. The names and the settings of each monster's location seem like Riordan was channeling Stephen King a la The Dark Tower series.

But for all that the writing and plot were kinda...whatevs, Riordan does a masterful job of bringing the Greek gods into the present (both in their descriptions and in the larger scheme of a book) and I can see how he can make a new generation of children fall in love with Greek mythology. Well done, Riordan. I say that as someone who never cared much for it beyond Disney's Hercules and left the book wanting to learn some real Greek history."
297,2,"I really don't know how I feel about this book. I was debating between 2 and 3 stars, but then I remembered
Percy encouraged her mom to kill Gabe (which she later did) rather than just leave the man now that he's no longer needed for his scent which made me feel I needed to rate it lower.

Overall it was a fun read. I wasn't overly fond of the writing style, but I understand the target market so I'm okay with the direction of first person narration as it's easier to follow for younger readers.

I enjoyed the worldbuilding. It wasn't ever too exposition heavy. And, of course, I liked the greek theme. The characters were interesting enough, but everyone outside of Percy felt pretty useless during the quest. This was more the Percy Jackson show, and although fun, I hope the other characters get to shine in the future.

Below are general thoughts:"
298,2,"Audiobook.

I’ve heard a lot about this book and series, and I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about. I enjoy #YA though I don’t often partake. Harry Potter? Yup. Loved it. Hunger Games trilogy? Yup. Super loved it. Divergent? Yup. Not a fan. Percy Jackson...let’s see how I felt.

The writing in this first book is no nonsense. It gets you right into the action and moves quickly. There’s not a lot of subtly; everything Riordan wants you to know is right on the surface. The characters are distinct, but their personalities are thin. Each fits an archetype—funny sidekick, sassy girl frenemy, and the plucky protagonist who stumbles into awesome power—and never wavers. That’s good for telling a simple story—which The Lightning Thief is—but that’s bad for character growth. These characters really don’t change throughout the novel—like, say, Ron, Harry, or Hermione did; they are who they are through and through. Some YA does more in this area; this book didn’t.

The pacing of the novel is swift. X happens and then Y and then Z. In some places, the pacing is nice because we don’t linger too long before the next big story beat. In other places, the pacing just blows past events that needed explanation seemingly for the sake of expediency. Unfortunately, that makes parts of the novel speed along much too fast, eschewing character development for plotting.

The plot itself felt very paint by numbers to me. I read a lot of fantasy, so that could explain my uncanny ability to presage every turn of the plot. It doesn’t deviate much from the format you might expect except in one instance—who the big baddie is. That was a nice twist at the end that stood out against the trite story beats in the rest of the novel.

I feel like I might give book two a go simply because this might be a warm up and the later novels might get significantly better. The writing was not bad. Just plain. Everything was just too predictable."
299,2,"2.75 rounded down

I wasn't really planning on trying to remedy my missing the Percy Jackson train, but some folks I know were doing a buddy read so I gave it a go. I get why it's a beloved series, and I definitely don't want to yuck any one's yum, but this book fell way short for me in the end.

Cons:
-Fatphobia abounding. All characters that are depicted as fat are evil. Step father, bully at the camp, camp director, and a monster that attack later in the book are all heavily described via their fatness and it is entirely a negative thing. There are no positive depictions of fatness. (There are two non-speaking minor characters that are depicted as ""plump"" - due to their lack of a speaking role & proximity to a not good character I don't think they're offsetting anything.)
-Just about every single plot point has lying, deception, or withholding somewhere in its origin. Between not explaining things or actively deceiving each other it's a little miraculous anything actually gets accomplished in this novel.
-Subpoint to the above: adults are to be trusted without question, but it is also adults that create the problems these *children* are now responsible for fixing. I am not a big fan of kids carrying the weight adults should be handling.

These two.5 issues are pretty weighty for me, particularly because this is a series of books directed at children. I don't have kids, but I wouldn't want them reading a series that codes fat as bad & solidly encourages deception & doesn't invite pushing back when an adult isn't making sense but is asking a lot of you.

-Percy Jackson *is*12*years*old*. That's too young for the things he does & for the writing to be convincing.

Pros:
-Grover. All of him.
-There is some clever use of Greek lore, and a few magical items that are dope.

All in all, the biggest redeeming quality of this book is how quick it was to read. I don't think I'll read anything from the series."
300,2,"It was alright. A good adventure story, but way too long. The thing I just don't get about a lot of these stories written for younger audiences is why they drag out - and not with any substance (like Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit) but with fluff. If this had been condensed, it would have been so so much better. I was asked to read it by my 11 year old. She started it and after a few pages she handed it to me and asked if it would get any better.
I had a bit of a hard time getting though as well. Things that the author made very clear early on were dragged out. Who is Percy's Father?! We just don't know, we cant figure it out... even though he gets near water and weird things happen. (Not to mention it's clear from the cover art.) This was the whole book. It makes the characters seem slow and dull when they can't guess what has been made abundantly clear. It was a bit like the Superman thing. Seriously. He's the same exact guy except with glasses and without glasses. How can these people not tell? You read something and think, I bet this is the problem, and then your guess is confirmed, and then you still have to wait... pages and pages for the characters to catch up. After a whole book of that, it just got to be annoying by the end.
Yea, thats the friend thats going to betray you Percy. It's so ridiculously obvious, but sure, go off with him by yourself. Seems like a good idea. SMH.
I really don't think the idea of this book was bad, it had some fun stuff for sure, but it could learn a thing or two from books like the Spiderwick chronicles. My kids plowed through all of those, and all of them said at the end, ""I wish they were longer! Or that there were more!"" Even longer books like Secret Garden, the City Of Ember, and The Chronicles of Narnia. If they're long, they should be full."
301,2,"I remembered this book as being pretty bland and uninteresting as a kid, thought I'd give it another chance and... Yeah. Kid me wasn't wrong.

Riordan gets some of the myths wrong, picks and chooses which myths he wants to deal with, applies a magical world overtop the mundane randomly. Urban fantasy is a tough genre to maintain a consistent worldbuilding and a slapdash effort just reads poorly.

I kind of want to talk about ideology, which is something that I didn't really think about when I was a child. This book is chock full of American exceptionalism and support for ""Western civilization"". Is there a reason why Mount Olympus, a real mountain in Greece and the home of the gods, needs to be relocated to the top of the Empire State, a symbol of America? It couldn't have been, say, a mountain of some sort, if you had to write a story that appeals to American kids? Why are they in America now? Why is Hades in LA? It's kind of weirdly unearned cultural appropriation tbh.

Here's what I think. Spoilers ahead. The book makes three distinct references to Western civilization, about how the modern age began when Zeus took over Olympus, and about how the villain's goal is to take down Zeus and, by extension, western civilization. By tying the concept of godhood/divinity, and western civilization, and America, there is this unsubtle implication that America is the new seat of western civ because Olympus was where the old seat was, and therefore America is rightfully the seat of godhood and the center of the world.

Like.

Ok.

I will give him this though, the book probably is a really fun read for a kid with dyslexia or ADHD, and not just because the pacing is incredibly quick. Main characters have those traits and talk honestly about how difficult it can be. Representation is important."
302,2,"2.5 estrellas.

Partir diciendo que no sabía nada sobre este libro; nunca vi las películas, ni leí algo sobre ellos, NADA. Y aun así ha logrado decepcionarme. Quizás mis expectativas me jugaron una mala pasada ya que, como dije, no tenia mucha idea de este libro, me imaginaba demasiada acción, guerra, mar, etc., y no ha habido nada de eso. Literal todo el libro es la misión de Percy acompañado de Annabeth y Grover. Si bien hay partes que si me mantuvieron medianamente enganchada, he tardado mas de una semana en leerlo, y me conozco y sé que si de verdad me hubiese gustado me lo habría terminado en dos-tres días máximo.

Pasando a los personajes, sí creo que están muy bien construidos, pero no me he vuelto muy fan de ellos. Annabeth fue mi favorita sin dudas, me encanto su historia y me emocionó en el final.

Para terminar, creo que los capítulos largos también jugaron una mala pasada, porque leía cinco paginas y lo dejaba de lado. casi para el final me plantee iniciar otro libro, pero sabia que si hacia eso nunca terminaría este y esa es la única razón por la que no lo hice, pero me moría de ganas. Creo que hay varias cosas que hicieron que esta lectura no fuese ni cerca de mis favoritas: el año, que entiendo que esto fuese muy famoso el año en que se publicó, pero a mi me aburrió esto de que siempre les pasara algo malo, que los traicionaran (siempre supe quién era el amigo que lo haría), en fin.

Y sí, planeo leer la segunda parte, a ver si mejora.

Pd: ame mucho, mucho (aunque fuese poco) lo que se mostró de la historia entre Sally y Poseidón.

Y aquí una interaccion entre Percy y Annabeth que me encantó too.

—No sé qué hará mi madre. Sólo sé que yo lucharé en tu bando.

—¿Por qué?

—Porque eres mi amigo, sesos de alga. ¿Alguna otra pregunta idiota?"
303,2,"I think the main problem with this book is that it came out after Harry Potter. If it was the other way around, I'd possibly enjoy it more, and not see it as a cheap HP rip off.

Anyway.

My eight year old absolutely fucking loves this series. She likes it better than Harry, and at her insistence, I started reading it to her and her younger sister at bedtime. To be fair, the first couple of chapters were very, very good, and I thought I was on to a winner. And then it all went a bit shit really.

Reading this book was a battle of bad-parent guilt vs saving some of my brain cells, as I struggled to read one of the most boring books I've ever come across. I found the character's dull, and lacking in any personality whatsoever. Oh, except for Annabeth who unfortunately reminded me of a watered down Hermione. After 300+ pages I did.not.give.a.crap. About Percy or his goat thing, or anyone else at Camp Halfblood.
I found the 'bad guys' tacky and cringe-inducing. A lot of people rate the monsters in their reviews, but the writing and dialogue was so poor, and yawn-inducing the 'fight scenes' and interactions became completely forgettable.

I could go on and on, and upset and offend many people who love this series, but I'd rather just celebrate that I've finally finished this damn book.
The idea of Percy Jackson/gods/monsters/adventure would work, and potentially be fucking great if it was by a different author. The writing does not give justice to the story, which is a shame.

I've given the book two stars. And they're purely for the fact that my kids LOVE this series, and anything that gets kids reading is 'good', and another star for sparking interest in Greek mythology."
304,2,"For a wide open, fairly free-form Y/A Fantasy novel, The Lightning Thief is remarkably unimaginative. Rick Riordan sets up a Harry Potter style scenario in which a misfit youth discovers that he is heir to a magical identity, then sets the story to autopilot, dropping in a miscellany of modern reimaginings of Greek gods and monsters against the wandering backdrop of a cross-country roadtrip.

The concept of intermixing ancient Greek mythology with modern America is curious, but Riordan provides no explanation—Greek mythology is apparently just ""real""—and the trappings of ancient Greece, from the monsters to the demi-gods seemingly lurk around every corner and behind every storefront, to a sheerly absurd degree. There is no explanation for the preponderance of mythological figures in modern America or why the characters encounter them so frequently. All of this adds up to a novel that feels forced and lazy, even in the context of frolicsome Y/A adventure.

Moreover, in a genre that is continuously growing and developing to encompass ever more culturally-relevant commentary (as in The Hate U Give or Unpregnant) Riordan's book stands out for its utter lack of big-picture meaning. What does The Lightning Thief say about culture, humanity, our planet, etc? Absolutely nothing; it's just a popcorn fest.

Taken as pure fluff then, The Lightning Thief is kind of fun. It was a quick, breezy read with a few laughs, no real surprises, and essentially nothing to say. For fans of Harry Potter and other discovery/coming-of-age adventure fantasies, it might serve as vaguely amusing filler, but there just isn't enough substance to be especially meaningful."

306,2,"This story really disappointed me. Not only did I hear lots of positive things about it, but the idea seemed so promising.

Unfortunately the terrible writing was simply too awful to overlook. Not even a 12 year old boy is that vapid and detached from reality. I mean, if it's meant to sound like an actual talentless 12 year old boy wrote it, then sure, nailed it. But I had higher expectations than that. I expected the voice of an accomplished and talented author, instead I encountered writing that was barely tolerable.

The characters were unrelatable and unbelievable. The modernisations of Greek gods were largely ridiculous and the ease with which our protagonist conquers obstacles that fell greater heroes than he was enough to cause me injury from constant eye-rolling and face-palming.

I suppose if I were a ten year old child reading this I might find it easier to buy, but that's no excuse in my opinion. I read a great many children's books and none I've read recently have been as poorly executed as this one.

It really is unfortunate, as I said the concept was very interesting and I really wanted to love it and have a new series to eagerly consume. But apparently that was not to be. Percy Jackson is simply not the hero I'm looking for.

I've read reviews comparing this favourably to Harry Potter. I can't understand how anyone could judge them to be anywhere near the same league. The only way in which I would compare them is to illustrate the way in which a children's story should be handled and contrast it to this overrated mess."
307,2,"While I'm aware I would have probably loved this more if I had read it at a younger age I'm still disappointed it didn't hold up for me as an adult. I'm going to keep repeating myself so I'm not burned at the stake here. And before I complain more I'll just say that know Percy was very young. Still his character was super ignorant which drove me up the wall. He didn't believe in Gods which is fine but when his best friend sprouts goat legs he is immediately on board with it. Percy just doesn't have any likeable qualities to me which I can usually overlook with traits like arrogance or intelligence but he didn't have those either.

Honestly though the narrator of the audiobook might have made my review a little more harsh. Rick Riordan's voice for Percy was good but made him seem less likeable and goes overboard with all the other characters especially the olders ones.

Even with me not enjoying Percy's character I couldn't get invested in the rest of the group. The old Gods in the modern world was pretty cool concept and also how the author used bits of lore to make them a new persona.

The plot didn't hold up for me either. I daydreamed through most of the story. Would start fuming when Percy would stay at the elevator by himself or go into some sketchy places with the prickling at the back of his neck knowing good and well something is going to go wrong. I just wished he had one redeeming quality.

I'll probably try the next book though just because I enjoy the new old Gods. Maybe as Percy gets older and wiser I'll enjoy his story more too."
308,2,"What can I even say about this one...a book that has so much love and nostalgia attached to it by so many people, but I just can't enjoy it. This book, to me, is average.

This is quite an easy book to read, fast paced and to-the-point. The thing is, I don't think this always works to the story's favour. The first page feels cringey and immediately fails to grip me. It seems shallow and simplistic to the point that I feel the author is making fun of me. This is one of these books I found really hard to immerse myself in (though I did, eventually, hence the 2, 5 stars). Everything is so quickly laid out, characters and places and events, that I find myself not caring about anything that's happening and unable to become attached. Without meaning to, I find myself drawing comparisons between this book and other fantasy children's books that I consider infinitely superior to this, writing style and story-wise, like Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, His Dark materials, heck, even Molly Moon!

Specific things I disliked:

~how the plot moves forward using lazy tricks, like how sacks for the Hermes Overnight Express just happen to be in Medusa's lair, or how there just happens to be information on the DOA Recording Studios, right in Crusty's place, where Percy and the others entered completely by accident.

~While the Greek Gods supposedly move along with the 'western spirit' , their half-blooded offspring's brains are still somehow 'hardwired' to Ancient Greek, hence the dyslexia. So the Gods, whose first language is Ancient Greek, have adjusted to English just fine, but the demigods, whose first language is English, can't adjust? Unless the Gods are also dyslexic and we're just never told? To me, it just doesn't make sense. This one, though, I can forgive, since it brings dyslexia to the forefront and that's a cause I can absolutely get by.

~'funny' comebacks. Honest to god, some of these are painful. BUT, I can get past that, since there are some genuinely funny parts in this. Most of them, though...it just seems like the author was trying way too hard. I get that this is a children's book, but kids aren't stupid, y'know.


OK, now on to the good parts! I couldn't care less about Percy's character, but Grover is nice. Also, there are some fun conversations among Percy, Annabeth and Grover. They make a good team.









But, the absolute best scene in the whole book (for me) is the scene at Crusty's.






I'm giving just a small snippet here, since I can't type out the whole thing, but this scene, I think, captures the essence of the fun in Percy Jackson.

What else? Despite my disinterest in the beginning, I pulled through and eventually started enjoying this book. It did take me a few days to finish, but here we are! This is not a bad book. I dealt with it in a more critical manner than its returning readers. I think reading this as an adult for the first time made me see its cons way too harshly. I think it's a fun book if you read it way young, nice ADHD and dyslexia representation, interesting context. The promise of diversity is what actually drew me to this series; but considering my minimal enjoyment of this, I'm not sure whether I'll be continuing or not. Idk, I wish I'd read this in primary school. Are the rest of the books better?"
309,2,"Okay, well. Unpopular opinion here.
.
I’m so disappointed!! I expected to really enjoy this! I thought there was a chance I could love it. One of those series I just never got around to reading but always heard such amazing things about. And maybe the hype did it harm, but man?! I simply did not like this.
.
I found the whole thing felt pretty contrived. Fitting myths and mythological characters in where they could sorta kinda work. It was gimmicky. And I don’t mind a good gimmick when it’s done well. This was not.
.
I found the main characters completely flat and not at all compelling. None of them had unique or particularly likeable qualities, and not a single one experienced any growth or even a minor shift. The friendships were fabricated, with no meaningful or genuine events to make them make sense. In fact, neither of Percy’s friends really needed to be there. (They literally just stood there most of the time.) He could’ve done the whole thing himself without the story being any different at all.
.
I found it painfully predictable both episode to episode (because it was written as a series of repetitive episodic “surprise” encounters) and start to finish. The only places it ever really surprised me were where the writing got even less well done—where characters did things that made no sense at all or where plot points fizzled where they could’ve been something.
.
I can see why I might like it if I was a middle grade boy who’d never had the experience of other middle grade books that don’t cheap out on depth of character or well-woven plot. And yes, BOY, because it felt very much like it was written to appeal to young boys … to fit into a young boy’s naturally shallow understanding of anything outside of themselves—slave to what they’d expect, heavily tokenized and stereotyped, rather than giving them a fresh, thoughtful, or different perspective. But seeing yourself in Percy might feel good.
.
For this reason alone, I’m tempted to hold onto this until my son’s older so we can read it together. Maybe seeing it through his eyes will redeem it a bit. And I sincerely do hope that if we carry on with the other books in the series, maybe I’ll see some maturity in the writing that’ll help it all come together. I want to be on the bandwagon, really I do.
.
Sorry. I’m as bummed about it as you are."
310,2,"I had watched the film adaptation of this book and couldn't, for the life of me, understand why fans of the book hated the movie so much because I actually enjoyed the film. One of the major complaints the fans had was the film changed a lot from the source material; so, when I was looking for another series of books to read, I thought I might as well check this out. First, maybe I should have read the book instead of listening to the audiobook because I really didn't like Jesse Bernstein's narration of the audiobook; he read the novel like he lost a bet, I've listened to Wil Wheaton read 'Ready Player Two' with more passion and more commitment. Secondly, Bernstein's voice sounded too old for the 12-year-old Percy Jackson and on that point, I understand why fans of the novel disliked the film because in the film Percy was more high school age than middle school. Other than that, though, this book wasn't really all that interesting in the beginning, the story only got more engrossing by chapter forty and even then, the conclusion was a bit anti-climactic but then again, if this was the beginning of the series, you wouldn't have the ultimate showdown with Kronos like you would have in the film; so, that much I get. Overall, this book was just okay but that hasn't discouraged me from checking out the rest of the series; on the contrary, it has piqued my interest more to read the rest of the novels, which I guess would be what any author would want— for their readers to continue reading."
311,2,"Era da tanto che conoscevo (in linea generale) la storia di Percy Jackson. Mi sono decisa a leggere questa saga solo dopo aver visto i due film che ne sono stati tratti. E’ la prima volta che apprezzo un film più del libro, nonostante il romanzo sia molto più ricco di dettagli e di avvenimenti, non mi ha fatta impazzire.

Mi è piaciuta la storia e l’originalità dell’ambientazione, ma vi ho scorto troppi clichè da fantasy moderno, alcuni dei quali rimandano palesemente alla saga di Harry Potter, la mia preferita in assoluto (ammetto quindi, che il mio giudizio non è assolutamente imparziale). Non ho gradito particolarmente neanche il modo di approcciarsi alla mitologia, in particolare il fatto di mescolare quella greca e quella romana.

Ovviamente la mitologia romana si rifà molto a quella greca, ma avrei preferito ci fosse una vera distinzione tra le due e che l’autore avesse scelto di trattarne una più nello specifico. Trovo che questo abbia creato confusione, allo stesso modo la questione degli “dei greci e romani in america” non ha molto senso dal mio punto di vista. Trattandosi di un’antica religione e di una parte della cultura delle regioni che l’hanno praticata (anche se nell’antichità) non sono riuscita ad apprezzare l’interpretazione che ne da Riordan nel romanzo.

Per ora ho letto solo il primo, quindi non posso dire di aver un quadro completo dell’opera, ma per il momento ho ricevuto questa impressione. Prevedo ovviamente di leggerla tutta, e una volta finita pubblicherò una recensione più completa e dettagliata, e poi chissà, potrei anche cambiare idea!"
312,2,"I found it hard to suspend reason to enjoy this book as I read it with my 11-year-old. First of all, you’re going to tell me that the gods have been operating in secret for the last however many thousand years and they’re still the same crappy gods?! I get that the author is introducing the old mythology for a young audience but to have an entire pantheon of ancient gods that has not changed one iota for the better really bothers me. They’re still petty, capricious, and worst of all, procreating constantly with humans, enough to fill a summer camp. Oh those silly gods, the campers laugh. These campers who are all basically the same age and who come, each one, from a broken family made up of one serial and unpunished rapist and one human victim.

But let’s not discuss the inherent issues with that, because it’s a kids book. Oh wait, it’s a KIDS BOOK. I’m not a prude but this profoundly bothers me.

I was oddly bothered by the claim that America is the spirit of the flame of the West so all the gods moved here. And, disregarding their European past, they apparently don’t leave America. Or have sex with anyone but Americans now. And have absolutely nothing to do with bettering this country. Murica.

The monsters in this book are awesome! Loved the fights and our intrepid little heroes. But not enough to be able to suspend the overarching daddy and mommy issues that ruin just about everything else in the book. I may be the only one that feels this way. Does the author address any of this in the next books? Skip this and read Harry Potter."
313,2,"The Lightning Thief is a story about a boy named, Percy, that is a son of Poseidon. He only just finds out he is a demi-god when attacked by mythical creatures in search of Zeus's lightning bolt. All the Gods think Percy stole it but when his mom is taken, Percy is more worried about getting her back from Hades. He and his friends, Annabeth and Grover, go on a quest to find Persephone's pearls so that they can escape the Underworld. They arrive in the Underworld to tell Hades they don't have the bolt. Percy asks for his Mom back but in a scuffle finds the bolt in his shield. He frees his mom and leaves Grover behind. He then heads for Olympus to give back the bolt. Luke is there to stop him because he wants war. Luke is the lightning thief. This is a book based on the Greek Gods that is wildly popular among many kids. However, I do not recommend it as a class read because I found it to have stuffed characters with disabilities into slots in the book. Percy has dyslexia and ADHD. The story does not mention how Percy copes with there things, other than disappointing his mother and being an outcast. The only time these aspects of Percy are positive is when they are considered a part of his demi-god nature. His book seemed to have a negative view of disabilities in everyday life that I did not appreciate. Although, I do recommend having this book in the library because it is a popular kids book that may encourage kids to read more."
314,2,"All in all, this was a great story in the sense that it seamlessly wove Greek mythology into the 21st century and I can understand why this series has been a hit.

However, a few things I had issues with -

1) The fact that Medusa was disguising herself as a veiled Muslim woman:

""I will just be a moment,"" Aunty Em said. ""You know, I can't see you very well in this cursed
veil....""

""Wrong?"" Aunty Em said, reaching up to undo the wrap around her head. ""Not at all, dear. I
have such noble company tonight. What could be wrong?""

What is wrong with Western men wanting to unclothe Eastern women, and why do they have so many opinions on women's clothes, wherever they are from? Why can't everyone just wear what they want to wear without being further alienated? I'm glad the movies didn't portray Medusa like this, clearly someone there had some sense.

2) Too many similarities to Harry Potter - invisibility ""cap"", a group of three going to defeat the bad guys with a clever girl, goofy guy, and brave but disturbed lead, dreams where you're actually looking through your enemies eyes, facing a three headed dog together, half-bloods, a school for magical children, a horrible influence at home, an oracle i.e. woman in hippy clothes who tells you a prophecy, the return of an ancient evil...aaand the list goes on. Yes the story still flows but one would have to be blind to say that ALL these similarities are simple coincidences.

Overall a 2.5/5 from me."
315,2,"I thought about giving The Lightning Thief a 3-star rating because I was scared of having people being upset with me for not loving the first Percy Jackson installment. But as I thought more about it, I can't say that I'd ever read this book again.

I may read the second one because I've seen that the reviews are higher than this one, but it's not going to be the next thing I pick up. Here are my thoughts on why I didn't enjoy the book as much as I expected to.

Percy Jackson seems like the type of book that you have to pick up at the right time. I believe in good timing when it comes to reading, and I think I may have waited too long to start reading this series. There are certain books in my life that are staples in my library because I read them at the exact right time in my life. Percy Jackson, unfortunately, isn't one of those books.

The characters seemed bland to me. Annabeth was stereotypical, Grover had no admirable qualities, and the rest of the cast blends together in the background. Percy was my favorite character overall because of his occasional sarcastic comment, but he's not a character that I would rank in my all-time favorite list.

I think I had too high of expectations for the book, and they were let down because of my inability to really immerse myself in this world."
316,2,"As soon as I picked this book up I could not put it down I was completely sucked into Riordan’s god filled world. The reason I decided to read this book was because of my interest in history and the overwhelmingly positive reviews I had heard about it. This book exceeded all expectations I had by a land slide. The story was great full of action and twists and turns filling it all in with an amazing combination of modern and historical settings. I did not see any personal connections in the story except for the main character and I sharing a case of ADHD. (Haha banter). The theme of this story is trust because the main characters often have to trust each other’s actions to survive some of the terrifying monsters they expierence through out, and an ultimate betrayal shows the value of trust. The authors use of teenager language makes it an easy and enjoyable read for kids that may have lost their zeal for reading due to dull adult language. This book is definitely aimed at teenagers, but could be enjoyable for all ages. The language makes it fresh and natural sounding that teenagers can understand. The adventure keeps the reader riveted to the book unable to put it down. Some adults may find it childish, but to younger readers they will be brought into a fantasy world they may never want to leave."
317,2,"Was curious to see what all the fuzz was about, also wanted to read something easy to start 2021 with. Been in a reading slump since nov 2020, but can't say this really helped much.

In a world in which the greek gods are powerfull but extremely dumb a young halfblood boy has to go on a quest to set matters right he didn't even have a hand in...no really they're incredibly stupid.
'Let's blame this 12 year old boy who didn't even knew he was a half god until about a few days ago that he stole my precious lightning!'
'....securitycamera's are a thing nowadays ya know?'
'Shut up being logical and stuff. Blaming this boy's more fun anyway :DD'
I guess children can just casually stroll in to Olympus and steal the most powerfull weapons in existence, without saids gods realising this until the thief's long gone?

It follows a very predictable pattern: traveling-resting-oh no something's off-a monster appears!-battle time-monster defeated. Rinse and repeat.

I did like the first 60 or so pages, it sucked me in I had to admit. Then it got stale pretty fast, after Percy and co left the camp, it just all went down the drain. I have to admit that it picked up near the end but oh no the twist with a certain person happened and I was done. I finished it, might pick up book 2 but so far not impressed."
318,2,"To put it plainly, this is not a Harry Potter — I mean, it is not a book that hooked me, consumed me, or actively made me want to read it. If anything, I found it quite annoying. I understand it is supposed to be a silly children’s book that also teaches facts about Greek mythology and stuff in a digestible way, but it was just soooo stereotypey and rather lazy in characterisation I found myself internally cringing multiple times.

The characters are so cliche, their personalities all revolve around their parents’ ‘positions’ (not to be a nerd, but that is also a narrow way to perceive polytheistic gods, as they were not confined to one ‘skill’, more like had preferences… hobbies, of sorts), all of their actions NEED to match their family tree, etc. I found them to be so two-dimensional, like I UNDERSTAND Annabeth is smart and Percy is rebellious but don’t they deserve to have some personality outside the prescribed traits?

Another thing I really disliked is the info dumping. I KNOW it’s a children’s book but even children can understand a thing or two without a wall of exposition every two dialogue lines. Got on my nerves a little.

The curses aren’t funny, the situations made me raise an eyebrow at best, the narration is dry for my tastes, etc. Not a fan of this one.

319,2,"Read most of this series almost a decade ago because the thing to do when you're twelve is to do what everyone else does. And I got through the first four of these before stopping. Not because they were terrible. In fact, I loved the characters: Percy's snark, Annabeth's sheer brilliance, Grover's adorable strangeness. But they felt too much like another literary trio for me. And I mean, the most iconic friend trio of our time: Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley. It's a magic sort of formula for a core character group, so it's no surprise that it would be mimicked, but it's been done before, so it's nothing too spectacular here. Just as it wouldn't be anything spectacular anywhere else.

I also thought that the use of the Greek mythology to be lifeless. They were just moved to a modern setting, but nothing was really changed to reflect the continually shifting conditions of our world. You could find the same characters and situations in a collection of the original myths, which is what I went and did. It's more impressive to show how older stories have the ability to change with the times rather than remain stagnant, I think, and though this can be considered an introduction to Greek mythology, I know for a fact that kids can understand the important concepts of the stories, whether they are being re-examined to fit the modern world or simply repackaged and called something new."
320,2,"I understand that this book was written for the author's child and students. He was trying to make it friendly to kids with dyslexia and have a hero with ADHD. However, the thinly veiled myth lessons spoken from the mouths of children didn't sound right. In fact, often what the children said didn't sound like contemporary children. I also didn't like some of the ways he talked about ADHD, and tried to equate it to misunderstood superhero/demigod powers. The idea could be good, but I don't think it was executed well. There were parts where my son was wide eyed or laughed, but overall I don't think either one of us were that drawn into the world. I hear the stories get better, but I'm not sure we will care to read one for awhile. It is not fun to read out loud with all of the simple phrasing of he said, she said, random action scene, joined by more he said, she said. The most interesting offering is probably Percy's mother, and the implication there is a larger adult world of complex sacrifice. Percy will come of age through seeing the world(s), rather than his attempts at outsmarting gods and titans. Hopefully, this theme gets developed in future books, because the characters are still rather flat. Do NOT bother with the abomination of a movie."
321,2,"2.5/5

I read this with my younger brother, and it was quite a fun story to read together. Riordan's take on Olympus and Hell were both very innovative, and the concept of a camp for demigods was a clever one. I'm sure the characters and the locations will get fleshed out as the series progresses, but I do wish that more time was spent at each location, fleshing out the surroundings, and giving us a clear sense of the timeline the children were operating within.

But also, this is middle grade / young adult, and having read a lot of adult fantasy and gotten used to a more slow, dense style of writing, this book felt incredibly fast paced, and at times, quite confusing. A lot of the Greek Mythology is slotted in, in a way that makes sense to those who grew up studying Greek Mythology in school, which I did not. This didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book but I do feel I would have understood the relationships between the Gods and the severity of the situation, had I known them. (I did know a couple things though, like Persephone's story and the myth of sisyphus, etc).

Overall, I'm probably not the target demographic for this series (which I knew going in) but I still enjoyed it."
322,2,"Great plot, lazy writing

So...
My nieces and nephews love this series, so I jumped into it to see what the fuss is about.
I understand that not everyone can write Harry Potter, but this book felt like exposition held together by lazily built characters.
It limps along with retellings of the stories of Greek gods, but doesn't give much freshness to the story or bring anything new to the realm of fantasy story telling.
Okay main problem with this book is that the target audience is preteens. The continuous underlying narrative of bad people as old fat ugly people (Not only is Percy's step father ugly and smelly, he's called Uglioni), there is also the never ending quest to save the ""Western World."" Seeing as the book is based in America, the utter lack of black or Asian characters is jarring, but then again it goes to show a lot about the gods' preferences? The only mention of Africa is in relation to starvation.
Maybe the next books in the series will improve?
I realise all this complaining is moot seeing as the series is already a movie series, but hopefully the screen writers will massage some of the problems out.
Will definitely be reading the rest of the series, but planning to keep rolling my eyes as I do so."
323,2,"eh I didn't like how the middle eastern woman who covered her face, and had a middle eastern accent, was the same one who Percy was uncomfortable around because he couldn't see her face. also of course she then turned out to be Medusa.
because of course the middle eastern woman who has her face covered turned out to be a monster. yay fun.

also there was so much talk about how the only great civilizations were the western ones, and it's kind of stupid, because you've had great Empires from everywhere in the world that has nothing to do with the western world. nope. I did not like that one bit.

also most of the things that happened in this book could've been avoided if the kids weren't so god damn stupid. why do you keep trusting everyone when EVERYONE you've met throughout the book tried to kill you and stuff?

also the ""plottwist"" in the end was totally predictable. but oh well, it's a children's book.

I died laughing at some of the jokes. and the pacing was quite all right. but honestly the stuff mentioned above bothered me enough that I don't really want to give it more than two stars.

This is my first time reading Percy Jackson, and I don't know what I think. Maybe I would've liked it more if I read it as a kid. probably."
324,2,"[guessing at the star rating / mining my old FB notes now that they are almost impossible to find]

now i know why the actor playing percy jackson is soooo thrilled. this will likely be the new harry potter - each book getting a movie - so he's in for fame, money, stardom, more money, women, and more money still.

actually, i really enjoyed the book as i was clipping along. i can see the appeal to young readers, and i turned my son on to the book by telling him the first few chapter titles (), and then reading the first few papragraphs aloud. for awhile we were tag-team reading. when i wasn't using it, he was reading it and - hey - if it gets boys to read - all the more power to it.

the problem came when i put it down for a day or two. it lost momentum for me. i guess i can't re-enter fantasy after i've been away from it, but i don't think that will be a problem for boys.

btw - i read this for book club. i wouldn't have read it otherwise, and that's what's good about someone else choosing your book - you get a broader view than you would on your own. so now fierce has found a whole new series"
325,2,
326,2,"Looking back, this book wasn't so good... it was part of the Harry Potter rush where every publisher wanted Harry Potter with the serial numbers filed off. This one was clearly rushed and written by a guy who didn't remember what it was like to be a kid, so the things in it were more like a grownup saying ""this is what kids like, right?"" and then totally missing the mark. For example, the Hogwarts equivalent here was a ""summer camp."" What? That's stupid. Just make it a school. It's trying too hard to be ""cool"" and ""hip"" with young people. ""Kids like summer camp, right?"" Uh, no. Kids like things that are different, and summer camp is different. Looking back summer camp sucked. This is clearly a grownup attempting to be ""cool"" for kids. The book is full of stuff like this. I do think Riordan got better as he went, and he's certainly more productive of a writer than Rowling, but he doesn't hold a candle to her on either storytelling or on a sentence craft level, and frankly also is inferior to his source material (Greek Myth). For people who were not already into myth, I can see this book is an entry point to get them more interested in myth, and therefore I am grateful. But for people like me who were already interested in myth, these books are annoying."
327,2,"To really appreciate this, it would have helped me to have more knowledge of Greek mythology than I do.
Two stars? Three stars? I read this because it has been read by grandchildren. With this in mind, it gave me concerns. One, do our children clearly understanding the mythology of Greek gods? Another, are they mature enough to process the marriage and reproduction between the gods and humans? Hopefully, middle-graders can give the story the lack-of-credibility it deserves.

The adventures of endearing demigod Percy (Perseus) and his like companions half-god Annabeth and satyr Grover were pretty tedious for two-thirds of the story (thus the two stars). The last portion picked up for me enough to make it interesting and to wonder what happens next in the series. I don’t care enough to see, at least for now.

Though I have read and enjoyed some fantasy, I guess I am not that ""into"" this sort.

(A bit of humor? At least the bias of the writer! In the Fields of Punishment, ""I could see people being chased by hellhounds, burned at the stake, forced to run naked through cactus patches or listen to opera music."" 😟)

328,2,"well I just realised after posting the first review, that I never added this book even to my ""read"" shelf. Oops. But I think it is a perfect analogy for how I feel about this book (and series, so far). I only ever hear great things about those books:
""great read, even if it's a childrens book"" - it really doesn't talk down to the reader.... I don't feel that way when reading. Sorry. Not at all.
""I love those charakters, they are so perfect for this story and always refreshing to read about"" - even after not only reading the first book in this series, and seeing that charakters get written out frequently to keep things new... I can't say that. I couldn't care less for any of those charakters to this point. (with one exeption where I was like 'yeah ok, he is kinda nice'... Tyson if you want to know. second book)
etc. etc.
The only thing I can kinda understand is the hype about the modernised turnes of mythes and mythology. That's kinda neat. But not more. I could just read the originals and think about it for two seconds more. Not to be mean.
Anyways... yeah I don't know. We will see. Maybe someday I warmed up to those books. Who knows"
329,2,"I read this book because I was curious to know what my 6th grade granddaughter was reading as part of the required curriculum. I am also always interested in the messages below the obvious themes and plots in books for this age level since they tend to ""color"" how young people see the world. In general, the Lightning Thief captures a pretty diverse world across gender and disability and where pretty much everyone is portrayed as a fully developed character. And, although Percy is the titular protagonist, there are many heroes. However, the lack of racial or ethnic diversity is troubling, as is the clear preeminence of western civilization. Although it is only one of many books that my granddaughter will read, combined with similar themes she's covering in social studies and geography, my African American female 6th grader needs to see herself represented and included as much as any other child. So, as usual, parents for children of color need to do the extra work of correcting and supplementing the standard educational curriculum and pedagogy. Always necessary and increasingly tiring."
330,2,The book is for kids and as an adult i don't think it is that good of a read.If you are a kid then go for this book without any second thoughts . To clarify I am a harry potter fan and i have also read them as an adult(yes i was a stupid kid who didn't read any books). So if you are a kid then go for this book without a second thought you will absolutely love it i wish read it in my childhood but as an adult it was not a very great experience. The similarities to the harry potter is painfully obvious.It is also too much fast paced for me.
331,2,"DNF. The whole ""Greek myth meets modern life"" concept ought to have been fun, but it is not. There are too many characters, none of which I am made to care about. Every young main character's father or mother has a tragic back story which we, as readers, are apparently supposed to know about (I was never taught about Greek mythology in school), but the main characters themselves fail to have any personality. Who is Annabelle? Who is Percy? They are devoid of any character.

Then there was the plot. A lot happened, and yet nothing happened at all. None of the things that happened at the theme park, the camp and at the various other American locations that I have already forgotten advanced the plot. I still don't know entirely what the main characters' main goal was.

Then there was the depiction of the various villains. Oh boy. If a new character got described as ""ugly"", you could be certain they would end up being a villain, because all ugly people are bad, am I right? Additionally, I fail to understand why the writer turned Medusa (a villain) into a “middle eastern” “gown-wearing” woman. It just struck me as vaguely islamophobic."

Aïe je pensais pas mettre aussi peu pour ce premier tome, mais j'ai vraiment pas accroché à cette histoire.
Le 0.5 va pour l'humour, qui est plutôt réussi, caustique.

Malheureusement je pense que je ne suis plus la cible pour ce middle grade, la hype doit être passée. J'ai pas trouvé les personnages très attachants ou très développés. Alors oui ils sont jeunes mais je m'attendais à plus les aimer.
L'intrigue autour des Dieux, de l'Olympe et compagnie ne m'a pas vraiment plus. J'ai trouvé ça brouillon par moment.

Le rythme est lent, alors que les personnages sont, dans pratiquement tous les chapitres, confrontés à un nouveau monstre ou une créature à battre. C'était trop fouilli et on se perd par rapport à la quête principale. L'auteur a voulu mettre plein d'action mais ça rendait le tout instable et le rythme brouillon.

J'avoue qu'arriver à la fin je n'en pouvais plus, il m'a fallu plusieurs semaines pour finir car je n'avais pas envie d'y retourner. Les derniers chapitres ont été lus en diagonal 😩
Je ne sais pas si je lirai la suite, en tout cas si oui, ce ne sera pas maintenant. (Pourquoi est ce que j'ai acheté la saga en entier ? 😆)"
333,2,"no because what made you think this was 4.30? Is it because it read well or was it because it was nostalgic? Is it because it’s the bones of Harry Potter wrapped up in subpar wrapping?

Do I understand that most writing is the same story over and over again? Yes, I’ve read How to Read Literature Like a Professor. I went through that. But this felt waaaaay to close for comfort. This felt like someone trying to ride on the tailcoats of another series and make their money off of it.

The book went by way too fast for the gravity of the events that went down. And don’t even get me started on the Medusa plot — she wasn’t dating Poseidon, he raped her. She wasn’t running off to see her boyfriend. You’re saying you can write a kids book with a bunch of “half-bloods” who know their parents sleep around quite often, talk about a 12 year old slaying and BEHEADING someone, but the rape thing is too far for a kids book?

And the idea that the gods are always falling for the same things as the myths was silly to me. So you’re saying that everyone KNOWS the myths and tales but the gods aren’t capable of seeing these same traps pop up over and over again? Give me a break."
334,2,"2 stars = it was ok.
And it was, really - but that's just it. It wasn't good or bad, just meh. I knew very little about greek mythology going in, but I knew enough to be able to predict every single thing that happened in the book. No surprises, no plot twists. It was so all over the place too, they were attacked every five minutes. I know it's written for kids, but that's no excuse, we shouldn't dumb things down for 12 year olds (most of the ones who read are smart anyway.)
The thing that annoys me the most is how detailed these fucking descriptions are, and how bad Riordan is at using adjectives and adverbs. He oversimplifies and over-explains everything to the point of me wanting to rip my hair out, the rest of the writing is just dull and flavourless. I've heard it gets better in like book three, and I gave City of Bones 2 stars too, but I still decided to read the entire series, and it has gotten better. So yeah, we'll see. Wasn't that impressed by this one though, maybe I'm not really the fantasy type."
335,2,"Percy Jackson is a troubled 12 year old boy who is trying to find his way in order to make his mother proud. He has behavior issues in school and tends to hang out with a weird crew of friends. To his surprise, one day, when he realizes his best friend is a satyr (a man with goat ears, tail, legs, and horns), his world gets flipped upside down when his world becomes engulfed with legends. Percy's world becomes full of satyrs, centaurs, and The Olympians (Greek gods).

Although I did not enjoy the book myself, I think that it was well written for the audience that the book was written for. I think that students (3rd-8th, maybe older) would be able to relate to Percy in the beginning of the story where he is a troubled student, trying to make his mother happy and stay out of trouble. Percy would be a role model for students who can realize that there is a world waiting for them outside of school. Percy still attends school and does his adventuring over the summer months, but he still gives the influence that school is still important."
336,2,"I chose to read this book because this novel is my little brothers favorite. I had also read half of it in 6th grade. I didn’t remember much so I wanted to refresh my memory on it. I needed to read 12 books of my choice in my class so I picked this as one of them. I would recommend this book to the younger age who are interested in Greek mythology.

How I would use this in a middle school classroom is to have it as a selection on my shelf. I don’t think I would make it a must read but it is something entertaining for both boys and girls. Many novels that a class may read don’t always interest boys due to them feeling most plots are mushy. I know that is what I experienced with my guy classmates in school while hearing their opinions on books we had to read. I feel this book will appeal to lots of students.

337,2,"I realise I am not the target audience but I have read middle school books that were still simply good reads. Also, I lack the nostalgia factor, since I have never read the books before.

The story is interesting enough but the book is just... so slow... and unrealistic... and I am not talking about Gods etc. but a 12 year old who doesn't even cry once despite all the things that were happening. A 12 year old who was never trained properly but is better than all the kids that have been in training for years? And despite the daughter of Athena supposedly being wise, it's Percy who comes up with most plans... uhm... ok...


I hope the next books might get better.

Well, I DNFed Harry Potter 1, so it's got that going for itself."
338,2,"2 Stars means “It was okay”. That’s all I can say about this book really: it was okay...

For a book where the protagonist is a twelve year old, it surprised me how mature he was at some points. Don’t get me wrong you never forgot he was twelve but when comparing him to the twelve year olds I know in real life, he made mature decisions and put others before himself.

The book did have some plot twists but some of them I saw coming a mile off - probably comes with the fact that I’m about 15 years above its target audience. But it was, overall, a pleasant(ish) easy read. An okay book.

I’ve have actually read this book before a good few years ago and straight afterwards I’d added it to my Not Interested pile and never looked back. However, I recently read an article on series of books where the first book is the worst but they get much much better and I thought to myself “I must give all these series a go”.

And so I did and here I am, rereading this first book so I can continue with the series to see if it gets any better. Wish me luck."
339,2,"I liked the movie more. Oop don’t attack me.
I’ll be honest I was bored during the majority of this. I didn’t really connect with the characters at all but that’s probably because they are 12. The plot was all over the place. Only thing I liked was how Riordan made it seem ok and cool to have ADHD and dyslexia which I bet made a lot of kids feel better about themselves. I really should have read this when I was a kid not a 19 year old. But like, I enjoy kid stuff so I don’t understand why it’s not hitting as hard as I thought it would. This series but YA would fuckin slap. Anyways I’ve got the rest of the series to go so maybe it’ll get better.
Grover was a pussy. He needs sass like in the movies.
I understand now though why the Percy Jackson fandom HATES the movies so much tho because it basically completely strayed from the book. If that happened with a sarah j maas adaption I would puke and have a fit. Buuut still I preferred the movie way more. We’ll see how the next book holds up."
340,2,"Maybe I'm just past the age where this would be a defining series, but I simply do understand the popularity of the PJO series, particularly within my own peer group.

From the writing style, to the predictable twists (minus the unnecessary last chapter that felt like Riordan simply forgot about the last part of the Oracle prophecy until it was almost too late), and the sheer unlikability of Percy himself, I don't get it.

I have been urged to continue at least the first series, however, and I have considered doing so. Again, I may simply have missed the opportunity to read this book at the right time. Many readers my age are as obsessed with this series as they are with series like Harry Potter, and I had hoped that I would at least find some enjoyment in the Greek Gods and some sense of nostalgia - unfortunately, I was wrong.

My main concern with this book, however, is the way it is written. I very much did not enjoy having Percy speak directly to me through his narration. It was jarring and unnecessary, and brought me out of the story rather than assisted in immersing me in it."
341,2,"Well, at first I was seriously thinking about quitting reading the book. It seemed like it was written by a little child and the plot was really silly. But I got over it and convinced myself to go on. The whole thing continued to be boring and unenjoyable till the moment Percy got to the Underworld. Then it all became a bit more interesting, but still nothing I would seek out. Maybe this book just wasn't made for me.
Despite all that, everybody says that the latter sequels are better, so for a second I played with a thought of reading the next book, but than I came to my senses. NEVER GONNA HAPPER!
Regarding the movie, I think that this is one of the very few cases where the film version is actually better. It was more thrilling and by making the characters older and giving them more opportunities to do stuff (like driving a car) it made the whole thing simpler and more elegant. Besides every book/movie needs a good ship and it would be quite weird shipping twelve year olds."
342,2,"This book really is not my taste, not even if read this when I was younger (as I was horse crazy and rarely read other books). I'm happy that these books appeal to so many young readers, even though I don't like some of the popular authors I love how they bring the magic of reading to so many people. Most of the time I was bored reading this, and I got annoyed at some of the plot/actions of the characters. One part was if Percy's mother knew that he is in danger why not send him to fighting/fencing classes, or anything would have been better then nothing. Percy also didn't seem too sad about someone close to him dying. And then the ending... How they were going to wait until after the summer before doing anything about... You know who... Like the danger will wait until they were ready to go on their next quest. I'm glad I finally read this though as know I won't feel tempted to buy the whole box series (like I have a few times) and guilty for not trying to read them."

I have had this book since I was in elementary school. I would always read up to the pink poodle chapter, and then stop, never finishing it.

I have to cut it some slack because it WAS a lower level read but I think the way it was written could have been a lot better. It seemed to just repeat the same events over and over again and the foreshadowing was so clear, I always knew what would happen next. I think the plot was so interesting and had so much potential that was wasted. I wish the scenes where he is discovering his powers had been more descriptive and enticing. It would have been fun to look more into Annabeth and Grover's powers as well.
I heard the writing gets better as the books continue and as the kids grow up, so I will be reading more of the series."
346,2,"""Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief"" by Rick Riordan is set in a world that immediately captured my interest. However, I found the writing style and storytelling ability of the author pretty mediocre. While the book's intended audience of children may not have noticed, I as an adult reader found the characters to be onedimensional and often acting irrationally in many situations. Additionally, the story lacks a ""wow"" factor that would elevate it to greatness.

Despite my disappointment with the first book, I was surprised to find that many adults raved about the series. I suspect this may be due to a sense of nostalgia or a fondness for the setting. I will reserve final judgment until I've read more of the series, as the main characters may become more enjoyable as they age and mature. For now, however, I can only give 2.4 out of 5 stars, as I appreciated the concept and setting, but was not satisfied with the execution and writing style of the book."

I feel like this is one of those times that if I had read this when I was younger or even 2 years ago I would have liked it at least a little bit more, so maybe it was a bit of a right book, wrong time sort of thing but yeah I just really couldn’t get into it and by the end I don’t even know if I was actually reading anything because I was so bored.

It’s not even the fact that it’s Greek mythology because I did like the the Greek mythology side of it, I think that’s the only reason I gave it 2 rather than a 1."

Especially if you are an atheist like me, the ideologies of this book infringes on my beliefs and my children. I do not want them to be influenced by the ""gods"" in this story. Additionally, my son has ADHD. In this story, those who have this conditions are demigods. This book ridicules my son's serious disease and the challenges that go with it. Why get my gullible child's hopes up that ADHD may be a miracle for him when he is suffering already?

As for the story, it was alright, so I am giving it 2 stars."
350,2,"It's field trip day for the middle school and Percy Jackson has a strange super-human encounter with one of his more hostile teachers. This is just one of a long list of his public school struggles, as an overall misfit with an irritating home life, few friends, and an vague understanding of his parentage. We're not far into the book when Percy finds himself at Camp Half Blood, and there he begins to put the pieces together relating to the origins of his strange and unpredictable powers.

For me personally? Big 'MEH.' It just isn't my genre. But I will say it was pretty well-written, not boring to listen to, relatable for the tweens and teens, a clean and entertaining read. Oh, also it bugged me greatly that the chapter titles basically told you exactly what was going to happen in that chapter. :o|"
351,2,"While reading this book I wasn't as interested and engaged in the book as I thought I would be. I think this is for multiple reasons. First I didn't like the character of Percy as much. I didn't like the typical hero he is and how cliche some parts where. I have heard a lot about this book and how good it was but I don't think it met my standards. I think this was because this book was meant for younger people in general. I think if I read this book a couple of years ago, I would have enjoyed it more. The basic story was bland and I thought it could be more interesting. I think if I knew more about Greek mythology, I would understand more of the book and hence understand it more. I may read the second book of the story to see if it was just the first book I did not like. I am having high hopes since many of the books in the series are liked by the majority of people."
352,2,"I knew I was in trouble here when the book started glorifying “western civilization,” which gave me some slightly-creepy coded racism vibes. I enjoy Greek (and other) mythology, usually, and this book did hold my attention well enough in the latter half, but even aside from the fact that this is a (middle grades) children’s book, I was less than deeply impressed. It felt like an attempt to capture the trappings of Harry Potter without the narrative skill. I liked the representation aspect, the spinning of traditional “disabilities” into the harbingers of super powers, but I still couldn’t like the characters that much. And although the “odyssey” aspect of the book felt appropriate to a Greek myth universe, and the ultimate reveal was age appropriate for middle grades readers, these were not handled in a way that felt particularly compelling to me."
353,2,"As a kid, this series of books were probably just my favorite thing ever. The mythology aspect intrigued me so much, and the characters were well made. But looking back on it, the writing in these books is crap. Half of the “mythology” in it is made up by the author, and it’s just so damn repetitive. Let’s start with the writing. The only way the author can ever creat anything like suspense, it’s only when one main character is keeping something from another for no damn reason. Next the myths. What the frick is the mist? If you read actual stories from mythology and go into these books, you will find way too many discrepancies. I’m tired rn so I can’t think of the other crap I was goin to say, so I rate this book a g for good when you were really little and couldn’t tell good from bad writing but now it sucks."
354,2,"Honestly, I didn't like this and I was hoping to like it more but it was more of a children's book than I was expecting. I have the whole series on my shelves so maybe I'll try and read the remainder of the series at some point but I'm glad I read (listened) to this.

This moved way too quickly and it was great to see so many Greek gods but by the same token and I get that this is a kids book so it needs to move quickly but by the same token it would've been good to linger on these gods for a while. I also think the narrator was annoying but that's not really the book's fault, it just took away from my enjoyment.

Maybe I need to try the YA series but I've got a weird taste in my mouth now from reading this. I think I would've loved this growing up so it's a shame I missed out on this."
355,2,"Okay, so I really wanted to like this book. I think I would have if three things had been different:

1. If I knew anything about Greek Mythology. I only recognized 3 names total, and the author didn't explain anything about the ones I didn't recognize. I think they wrote it for people who already know and love Greek Mythology, not people who come in clueless

2. If I was younger. The writing style was very basic. Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't read a super well written adult level book right before?

3. If the kids had better attitudes. Their snarkiness and disrespect for adults and for each other really bothered me (that's something that always bothers me in kids books, though)

All that said, I can see why kids who are into Greek mythology really love these books! They're good, just not the books for me."
356,2,"Two stars for the star of this book, Annabeth! Thank you for making this book bearable, but just barely.

The writing and the plot didn’t bother me. I thought they were good! What did bother me is the uncomfortable ideologies present in the story. Sexism, ableism, American nationalism.

I felt like I was sold the idea of an epic journey, not a cross country road trip with the occasional Greek monster.

I feel like the Greek mythology elements were also pretty… basic. It would have been interesting to see Riordan’s own take on Greek myths. Why the heck couldn’t Mount Olympus stay in Greece instead of a floating mountain cap hovering over New York because Western civilization is strongest in America or something? I guess that’s technically Riordan’s take on Greek myth… maybe I’ll take basic after all."
357,2,"Probably should’ve read this a few years back as it’s meant for a younger audience, but reading it now after I read mythological-fiction books such as Circe by Madeline Miller or basically any other unrelated, well written book, this was quite disappointing. It took me way too long to force myself to read since I got the whole plot halfway through. Though I should probably say that if you don’t have any knowledge of the myths beforehand that might not be such as issue for you. Even if the author can’t stop themselves from foreshadowing literally EVERYTHING all the time. Haven’t decided if I’m gonna read the next book. Just so you know if you’re looking for something like Harry Potter this could be nice for you but it’s just a kids book so don’t get as hyped up from the internet as I did about it because it’s just disappointing."
358,2,"Did you know this is not good if you didn't read it as a child? I don't begrudge anyone who has liked this since childhood, but I will not be able to adopt it in my life now.

Engaging enough that I want to know the plot of all the other books but I actually find the whole concept has aged very poorly and honestly feels offensive--to bring Greek mythology into the present and basically assert ""Western culture is good and correct and true"" and to not even grapple with the inherent racism of that, not to mention the more pointed references about WWII and the fact that Thomas Jefferson is someone who judges your soul in the afterlife ... it's giving the ick. I hate when books try to flit over the oppression of real people by making their white characters live in some loophole fantasy world.

Really wish I could have liked this!"
359,2,"My 11 year old son loves this series. He has been begging us to listen to it as an audio book in the car. We just finished it and while I love that it got him excited to read, I wasn't the biggest fan. It bothered me that there was so much sarcasm and sassiness between characters, lots of negative teen attitudes, and portrayals of dysfunctional families. It just rubbed me the wrong way. And while my kids loved that there was so much action, it kind of bothered me that each chapter they were facing a new monster to fight. It was exhausting! But, my kids liked learning about Greek mythology so I guess that was the one redeeming quality. My son has read the entire series, but I don't see us listening to any more of them in the car."
360,2,"I'm reading these because my daughter is hyped up about them. Honestly, finding them dull, the writing isn't great, it's all very derivative. I did like the idea that his being ADHD / dyslexic was a symptom of his half blood. Other than that - I really didn't like Percy, he's so freaking oblivious. It feels like the Harry Potter books again - here's a makeover of ideas that have been written better by other authors in the past, this time pulling on mythology rather than fantasy literature, that at least it gets the kids reading, and I rather expect there's fanfic out there that's better than the original. But it's making my daughter happy that I read it, and in exchange I'm getting her to read some good stuff, so that's worth it."
361,2,"I started reading this book with very high expectations,thinking that it would be as good as the Harry Potter series. Because they too are about an eleven year old boy and was originally written for young children.I heard some booktuber gushing about it and saying how much they loved this series so I decided to give it a go,but was totally disappointed.

I’m not saying it’s bad but I think if I had read it back when I was 12 to 15 myself, I would’ve liked it a lot better but now at 24 I’m just too old to be reading this and I have to say that,sadly,I did not enjoy it or like it a lot.I did watch the movie a few years ago and liked it very much,and I ha e watched Clash of the Titans and that movie was incredible so the book just couldn’t impress me."
362,2,"I read this aloud with my son and while we enjoyed it together and wanted to read to the end, I have to say there wasn't much of this book that felt really original or truly well and/or compellingly written. It took me a long time to get on board with Percy as a character, the mom instinct in me wanted to run away fast and read something with more depth, something more classic. I'm not feeling the pull to read more of this author's work at all, but for my son, I would of course; still...I think we can reach for better writing. I will say learning more about the Greek gods has always been something I've wanted to do (my son is really enjoying his Greek gods unit in school) and this certainly got me thinking about that."
363,2,"-1.5 stars- I truly thought I would love this book because it integrated Greek mythology which is really appealing to me, but I was fooled due to the high ratings. I didn't particularly like any character, nor was I interested in what's going to happen to them, half of the time I was reading this book I was reminded by Harry Potter, even though I didn't read the books, it felt like Percy was similar to Harry in some ways, but what disappointed the most is the way Greek mythology was portrayed, it felt too americanized..Everytime the author would describe a certain God I didn't feel its awe it seemed just like a regular person. I honestly wanted to read the whole series but unfortunately I'm not going to continue with it, due to my disinterest in knowing what's going to happen next."
364,2,"I enjoyed reading most of the popular teenage fictions like Hunger Games, Harry Potter and Divergent series but this just wasn't it. I picked up this book because I wanted to see when is it suitable for my daughter to start reading this series and because of the high ratings, but it was such a disappointment. I think the author was trying to build up mysteries in the storyline and want to unravel the pieces for later but the way it was narrated was just kind of annoying. Like the characters that Percy encountered will lead up to a question and just walks away or disappear without finishing a sentence. I can see my kids enjoying this series when they come of age or if I'm 10-15 years younger, but I just dont think this is for me."
365,2,I didn’t really care to much for this book. This book is about a boy name Percy Jackson who is sent to this camp called camp half blood were people with powers are sent. During his adventure he fights creatures and gods. In one part of the book he fought medusa in a fast food restaurant. I didn’t like this book because I thought that him just fighting demons was that interesting and I would have preferred it if he had been fighting criminals. The part of the book that I found interesting was the beginning when he is at a field trip at a museum and he had gotten in trouble with his pre-algebra teacher named Mrs.Dotts and she disappeared and everyone told him that there was never a Mrs.Dotts.
366,2,"Why does this book have so high ratings?
I didn't really like this book that much... It felt like a bit too much of a roller-coaster which was also really predictable after like 2 incidents...
The trio ( which seems very similar to HP) keep meeting people who they think aren't monsters but are always monsters or gods.. There is no element of surprise after 2-3 such incidents..
The book seems like someone wanted to educate people about Greek mythology and wrote a story about it...
Even the prophecy unfolded in a very predictable way...
Even the writing was very informal and offhandish....

Maybe I read the book at the wrong age... It's meant for YA audience and I am in late 20s.. but I really didn't enjoy the book as much as reviews suggest..."
367,2,"Usually, when i give two stars i give two stars because it was a bad book but it had that one redeeming quality... With this one I'm pretty sure I've read it multiple times and i still don't know if i could tell you how it ends.
It's a children's book written for children probably for twelve year old's if we go by the age of the hero, so it's no shock that when i read this for the first time as an adult I was a little under whelmed.
As someone who isn't super into mythology I think this book just wasn't for me.
I don't think It was a bad book... I just don't think I'm the demographic they were shooting for... my bad.
But i will say, his love of all bright blue foods is one that is very relatable to me."
368,2,"Well, this was the biggest disappointment in a long while. So many people love it, so I had great expectations, and the book is well written and easy to read, but... I don't think I've ever come across such an idiotic protagonist before. All the plot twists could be guessed from ten miles off, and were foreshadowed constantly, making Percy and his friends seem profoundly stupid for not figuring a single one of them out. Plus there are hits like temporary fridging, the ever-lasting concern with ""Western civilization"" (and of course Olympus is in New York, God forbid anything at all important was ever outside the US) or the casual reminder that women in niqabs aren't to be trusted because there could be anything under there!"
369,2,"now i would say that if i was a kid i probably would have loved it, but that’s not true. I was never a percy jackson kid. i believe i read this book in fourth grade, but never made it to the second one. that being said, as an adult, turning world war ii into a fight between greek gods feels so antisemitic. the humor wasn’t for me. percy really doesn’t have any genuine reactions to any form of trauma. special snowflake shit. also — this western expansion imperialist bullshit was really icky to me. the american setting felt off (shout out to the stl arch i see every day on my commute) and the idea that the gods just came to america in cartoony stereotypical fashion was… sad. plot was repetitive."
370,2,"This book was okay. Nothing outstanding or terrible about it.
I thought that the way he reacted to his mother's supposed death at the beginning was weird. If he truly thought she had died, regardless of whether he got her back at the end, I would think he'd be a little more distraught.
I also wasn't a huge fan of the writing, it wasn't very engaging, and even my eleven-year-old brother, who I was reading this with, wasn't very impressed by it. We'll be reading the second book because we already rented it, but I don't think we'll be continuing after that one unless it ends up being a huge step-up from the first. Even as someone who adores middle-grade fantasy, I don't really understand this book's popularity."
371,2,"So. Much. Passive. Voice.

It's an obvious attempt to cash in on the Harry Potter franchise, but with a Greek god flavoring. Prepare for dozens of name-drops, because every member of the Parthenon *must* be mentioned. The story never really finds its heart, either due to the cast or the writing style of the author.

For a twelve year old boy, Percy is a bit too mature and too nonchalant about his lineage. The kid finds out he's the son of Poseidon and doesn't make any juvenile water pranks?

And why does everyone have the exact same personality in their dialogue. Zeus, Grover, Annabeth... None of them sound different from one another.

It's just ""meh"". Maybe I'm so unhappy with it because it could have been so much better."
372,2,"Okay... so I may be too old to appreciate this book properly.
usually I'm a fan of YA fiction because it doesn't have traumatic assault scenes and still usually has awesome plots and intriguing characters.

I didn't really feel that with this book. I felt that there wasn't much plot, and the author didn't trust me with complex ideas or difficult problems. Just straightforward action. It really felt like it was written for the big screen... but unfortunately they bungled that as well.
I first saw the movie... which was meh. Then everyone said the book was better, so I tried that... and meh.

If you like action, teens being teens, thin plots, and Greek mythology out of context, this is the book for you!"
373,2,"Don’t hate me…

I’m sure it is a much different experience if you read it when you were younger and are reading again for nostalgia. But reading for the first time at 32, I found it underwhelming. I chose it because I saw so many people recommend it if you loved Harry Potter (which I read at 30 and absolutely loved). It just doesn’t have the same feel as HP though. It reads much younger, even though he’s actually older than Harry. I liked the take on mythology, because I know very little about Greek mythology and this simplifies it to where I can understand it. Other than that though, I was bored pretty much the entire time and wanted to just hurry and get it over with. Haven’t decided whether I’ll continue the series or not. May just save it for when my child is old enough to enjoy it."
374,2,"I picked this up because my partner recommended it.

It is an epic tale, I must say, but the writing style is aimed towards children, and I can't get past that.

The bulk of the book was Percy and his friends getting themselves distracted on their quest and running into trouble. It felt like useless parts that didn't need to be included, because it didn't contribute to the main mission that they were on. Not only that, but it was all tell, and no show (which makes sense for a kid's book, but it wasn't particularly immersive).

Despite this, I'm going to read the second book because apparently it gets better. If the writing style doesn't improve, or if I don't see any merits to it, I wont be reading the third."
375,2,"Not my cup of tea. I do not like mythology or fantasy. I am also older than the intended audience. I can see why the tween group would like an adventure story with monster slaying in it, though.
Beyond that, the book is so flawed. I do not like how the evil characters are ugly and the good characters are physically attractive. I know some of this is from the Greek mythology stories. There is no reason this could not have been changed. Ares did not ride a motor cycle in Greek mythology.
I found the plotting and character development weak. There is great children's lit out there with excellent writing. Percy rarely had a plan. Things just happened and problems were resolved on the spot."
376,2,"The writting style wasn't the level that I'm used to and was very simplistic, almost as if meant for someone who doesn't know english so well of a young child. However the story line as great and a HUGE step up from the movie. I watched the movie first and then the book and I'm really mad at how they completely disregarded the entire book when making the movie. Right now I'm also reading the last book of the Harry Potter series and I must say I prefer them but I'm also more familiar now with the characters there and the world, so maybe I'll soon feel like the Percy Jackson world is also like a family to me as I go on in the series."
377,2,"I am kind of frustrated I feel this way about this book. I had a hard time finishing it. The fact that I saw the movie first plays a lot in the fact that I don't care as much as I would like about the first novel of the Percy Jackson series. Of course, I will give The Sea of Monsters a chance. Part of my enjoyment was ruined by the fact that I knew the ending to The Lightning Thief.

I don't think the story has a lot of depth. And I didn't like the characters nor their humour. This whole prophecy thing got me yawning.

I hope the second book gets me more excited about Percy's adventures, because I remember LOVING the movie."
378,2,"When I was in High School, I read this, thinking it will be a superpowered teen with Greek Mythology themes. It is exactly that, but I found some scenes uncomfortable. There is a part where the character is introduced to the camp of demi gods, and they are all children of various gods, and they're stereotyped that way. Needless to say, the evil gods were given evil/bully children and the nice gods had nice descendants. IDK why exactlythis made me stop the book, but maybe it was also the quality. I guess the fight scenes weren't that thrilling, either; just the typical fighter teenager set up, most of the book revolving around monsters that have little to no characterization."
379,2,"I am not blind - I can see that the average rating for this book is 4.23 stars, but here are the reasons why I thought The Lightning Thief was not that great. Number some, the reader needs a lot of background knowledge of the Greek Gods and Goddess, and there are so many mentioned, it was confusing to keep track. Number two, the fantasy of this novel just didn’t hit a higher note like Harry Potter or The Hunger Games did for me. Number three, it’s very unlikely Percy can find his way out of so many dire situations, and he does. That’s bogus! I admit, there were some clever scenarios, like the Lotus Hotel and the trip to Hades, but overall it left me wanting to read my next book."
380,2,
381,2,"2.5

I'm pretty sure I would have liked this book so much had I read it when I was around Percy's age but as an adult, I found it to be pretty ""meh."" This world isn't super interesting to me, the quest that took place in this book was also kind of medicore to read about. I don't want to blame it completely on the target age audience for this series (middle grade) as to be the reason why I was just ""okay"" about this first book because I am a huge fan of middle grade in general. Overall, I will continue on with this series because I heard it only gets better but I can't say I was blown away by this one."
382,2,"Elég halovány Potter-ripoff. A szereplők legtöbbször idegesítőek, a nyelvezet nekem nagyon-nagyon amerikai volt (ami persze érthető, csak nehezen szoktam meg). De a legnagyobb problémám az volt vele, hogy ez nem egy sztori volt. Csupán egymást követő random események, amire a szereplőknek minimális ráhatása volt. Mindez azért sajnálatos igazán, mert az írás maga élvezetes lenne, jó az író stílusa, csak az eredetiség teljes hiánya és a gyengén megalkotott szereplők rengeteget rontanak rajta. Feltett szándékom volt, hogy az egész sorozatot elolvassam. Egyelőre nem mondtam le róla, és nagyon remélem, hogy csak a kezdet volt ilyen döcögős."
383,2,"Started off moderately interesting but by page 41 I was over it. I can buy a lot of stuff in literature -- note that I love the Harry Potter series and the Lord of the Rings trilogy -- but Greek gods actually being real in our world? Absolutely not.

Bumps too clumsily against my notion that there's only one true God who created all things, who wasn't made in the image of man, but made man in his image. I don't see the point of gods who are essentially flawed humans with unlimited powers, who are capricious and selfish and live forever.

The illustrations in this edition are beautiful, by the way."
384,2,"I think that this book on it's own isn't the best because of it's simplicity but as the series go on it gets more intriguing. I think that you have to start reading this series before reading the ""Heroes of Olympus"" or even ""Magnus Chase"".

The fact Rick Riordan has wrote multiple series based on the different religions of the people. This book gently introduces the Greek gods to the reader (although I had to look up some of the words/gods). The characters are described quite deeply and there is some kind of romance going on. I really like the ending of the book because it leaves you wondering what will happen next which leads you on to the next book."
385,2,"Very cliche and seems ""heavily inspired"" by Harry Potter. The plot is pretty much the same as sorcerer's stone. Percy realizes he's special and has to go to a place to train. Sound familiar yet? He meets two also magical friends at the camp and is sent on a quest. He defeats a powerful being and gets a rival. He then heads home. Don't even get me started on the language and jokes. The narration was a lame attempt to make the main character look witty, but just make him look annoying. The only reason I'm giving this a two star is because I liked the unique twist between the modern world and Greek mythology."
386,2,"Let me preface this by saying:

1.) I’m in a book club at the high school where I work, and the kids chose this as our first read this year; and 2.) I never read this book/ series as a kid. It was written when I was in middle school, so it hadn’t gained popularity yet.

With that being said, I will not read this book again!

I didn’t find the characters likable; the writing was formulated; the “plot” twists were predictable; and the scenarios were just unrealistic. Everything read immaturely, and I struggled to read most chapters.

To a middle-schooler this is probably a quick, fun read. To an adult, it was disappointing."
387,2,"This book is about about a boy named Percy who finds his place through a magical camp. This camp is called camp halfblood and it's for demigods. He starts an adventure to stop a war between gods. Much of his problems come from being a part of the big three which include Hades, Zeus, and Poseidon. I never was a fan of this book so I decided to reread it to see why. The book was written on a low level of reading. It wasn't a very creative or entertaining story either. Unless you are into Greek mythology or like children's fantasy books this probably won't draw much interest. I give this a 2/5 stars."
388,2,"Aún no decido si darle 3 estrellas o 2 estrellas, los primeros capítulos son tan aburridos nada pasa y se vuelven muy tediosos, esta muy bien escrito, eso es verdad, pero no sé no fue para mi.

No creo que el problema sea que es para niños, si no la falta de creatividad para escribir los primeros capítulos. Después hace una mejora a mi gusto pero no significativa.

No tengo personaje favorito, también dicta mucho eso de mi calificación, pero ya compre los libros, así que leeré el libro 2 a ver si esto mejora.

A todos les encanta Percy que siento que leí un libro totalmente diferente al que describen en reseñas."
389,2,"Ok objectively I think this is a strong kids book. Subjectively I just didn’t like it very much. Very pilgrims progress with crazy event after crazy event that didn’t actually do anything to move the plot forward. A lot of equating the evil characters with ugliness or fatness. And something about the sanitization of all the raping the Greek gods did for the purpose of this story was just really weird to me - every time they referred to “your mom��� or “your dad” it was jarring. I also was not surprised by what happened and how things ended at really any point, which was kind of a bummer. Glad to get it off my tbr but don’t plan to continue the series."
390,2,"I loved Harry Potter, Ender's Game, Hunger Games, etc for young adults. The general theme was interesting and surrounds a lot of Greek mythology but knowing a fair amount, you knew exactly what was around every corner when the protagonist encountered them. I also had the audiobook and I wanted to puke. The individual reading had the most cliche voices and was pretty one dimensional. Give me something that isn't focused around such juvenile thought processes and obstacles that one can't foresee outcomes pages ahead.

Not very impressed."
391,2,"I’ve made more than one attempt to get through this book, since the series is so popular with young people, but I always bomb out about half way through. It’s not just that the characters are boring; the plot suffers, too. It’s sort of a Harry Potter rip-off, substituting mythology for wizardry. A kid has special powers he’s barely aware of, he’s whisked off to a special school where he meets others like himself. . . so what’s new here? I realize that juvenile fiction doesn’t have to be great literature, but the best kids’ books are great reading for adults, too. This one isn’t."
392,2,"""Should I read these books?""

In my opinion, yes, but know that the writing in the first book is very bad - Mr Riordan was not a writer and learned the craft as he went on.

But he really loves mythology and always escapes from old lazy stereotypes in greek mythology that a hack hollywood screen writer would use- he really knows his stuff, and that makes the story engaging, as the chracters start to grow on you.

Not a huge start, but if you stick to the road it gets better. If you would rather jumpt to a good start, his second series on the Olympians is a lot better."
393,2,"I got some serious HP feels, what with Percy being the chosen one, the Trio with the smart girl best friend, the hero's self-doubts, one archenemy acting through others and regaining power. I have to admit it was a letdown. Nevertheless, I would like to see whether it gets better in the next books and proves to be different.

P.S- There was even a reference made to Harry Potter in the book. And the first Percy Jackson movie is directed by Chris Columbus (Yes, the same director who gave us the first HP movie)"
394,2,"Child literature not entertaining for a 34 year-old male adult.

I read the first book in a single day without trouble, the book is easy to comprehend and easy to read, the pages flow in the reader's hand.

However, I did not like the conflict resolution, nor the characters and their personalities, nor the constant links with United Stated geographic locations and pop culture.

I read this book after finishing ""The Wheel of Time"" from Robert Jordan, and they are worlds apart.

As a side note, I read Harry Potter and I never felt disappointed by the series."
395,2,
396,2,"This is the most disappointed I've been while reading a book in a while. It started off really bad and got mildly better through the middle and end, but was never in any way good.

As a fan of Greco-Roman mythology, I was hoping for much more than goofy conversion characters and plots that made no sense, especially scene to scene.

It really surprises me that this book is as popular and highly rated as it is. I am curious if it gets better and ages with the reader, but not sure if I am intrigued enough to try any more books in this series."
397,2,"A mi hijo le encantan las sagas de Rick Riordan. Por eso leí el primer libro de la primera saga. Y además después de ver la película... Entretenido, con ritmo desde el principio, con alguna introducción a la mitología griega que puede ser interesante desde un punto de vista educativo, didáctico. Pero vaya, para adolescentes. Personajes planos, situaciones predecibles, lenguaje sencillo. Quizás sea muy apropiado para lectores noveles o sencillamente entretenido para jóvenes con ganas de aventuras."
398,2,"(Unpopular Opinion . . . Obviously)
I give Riordan props for his original idea but man how it went south from there. Shallow characters, shallow plot, shallow dialogue, and shallow story. One of my biggest complaints is that Riordan ALWAYS made the scenes feel unreal and low stakes by filling them with goofy monsters and cheesy dialogue. The Greek God aspect / Camp Half-Blood is great, but EVERYTHING else was simply bad. I made it through the first four books, opened up the first chapter of book five and couldn't bring myself to finish it."
399,2,"I dont dislike this book, nor I freaking love it. I actually has few issues with it. The knowledge of the Greek myth is so general and there is no exploration to its historical aspect. If you new to greek mythology, then it's probably good for you for a introduction. But it's not really deep enough. The plot is kinda shallow, and the author thinks what makes it interesting is the greek myth and creatures involved in these children adventure. Conclusion: this is not for me. I love greek myth but not to be story told this way. This is wayy too for children."
400,2,"Good story, but felt rushed

As a casual fan of Greek mythology, the plot and the subject matter were very intriguing, but the first installment in this series definitely read like a middle school teacher’s first book to me. The book is already almost 400 pages long, but there were several chapters that could have benefited from more detailed scenes, especially the action scenes. That being said, I do look forward to continuing with Percy Jackson’s journey and will be reading the rest of the series."
401,2,"I feel like my rating is almost unfair...almost.

I've read some of the spin off series, and that was the biggest downfall of this book. This book isn't exactly bad, but compared to the later series... It's ROUGH, to say the least.

The pacing is all wacky, and it takes awhile for it to get interesting. Percy is irritating and kinda stupid. The narration is trying, but failing, at being funny and witty. And all of that is such a disappointment because literally none of these issues happen in the later books that I've read."
402,2,"Look the blending of the modern age with the stories of the Olympians is interesting but this book is filled with patriarchal/boys-ultimately-save-girls, and ableist vibes that leaves this book with a terrible aftertaste. For me, even worse than the sexist sentiments, are the normalizing of abusive and neglectful relationships. Granted, the story of the Olympians are about extremely neglectful parents, but Riordan paints a world where children just accept that abusive neglectful relationships are a norm."
403,2,"2,5☆
Desde que me interessei em livros, Percy jackson era exatamente o livro que eu queria ler, o protagonista era jovem, tinha elementos mágicos e mitologia grega que eu sempre fui apaixonada. O tempo veio e foi, eu cresci e por motivos que não sei explicar acabei por não ler, minha vontade e expectativas desapareceram e foi quando eu finalmente decidi lê-lo. E foi uma experiência bem morna, não me apaixonei por nada  e nem ninguém (exceto o próprio Percy que é um amor)ao mesmo tempo que não odiei nada na mesma proporção, em fim, não vejo o porque de continuar com a saga (quem sabe um dia)"
404,2,"So i read this book a while back and i’m going to be completely honest, i wanted to like this book so so bad especially because my friend was talking to well of it so i really wished to like it but i honestly didn’t. Like nothing in it makes any sense? minotaurs, centaurs and what else… it’s not realistic like hades really?? these people don’t exist in real life so i couldn’t possibly give this book more than 2 stars. and the reason i gave it 2 anyway is because Percy was a bearable character, i will however not be reading the second book."
405,2,"Ultimately, The Lightning Thief just isn't for me. I regret my early comments by which I implied, or perhaps directly said, that only an ignorant, ill-informed child would enjoy the book. I understand how someone would find the book enjoyable. If that's you, that's great. Honestly. There is no canon of books that must be read. Reading should be a delight, not a duty. Don't let me yuck your yum.

If your reading tastes happen to hew close to mine, then I suspect you likely won't enjoy . Otherwise, if the book strikes your fancy, go for it."
406,2,"I didn't realise how important to me a decent female protagonist is - Annabeth was hard to connect to and there were few other kickass female characters. Also I like learning about how a hero works for their skills, Percy automatically was good at certain things without really having to learn. Overall an engaging read but a bit low on the character development to grab me/a bit fast paced jumping from one monster to another with not much in between. But good to mindlessly have downtime... Don't think I'll bother with the rest of the series."
407,2,As a teacher I get exposed to quite a few popular children’s books. I’ve always heard that these books were a “new perspective” on the Greek Pantheon. God of War II is a better “new perspective” on Greek Mythology because it adds a new characters that actually acts in a way that expands on our understanding of these ancient characters and how they would act. The lightning thief rides on the coattails of coattails left behind by Harry Potter copycats. Terrible character motivations hidden behind a veil of teenage angst. Would not recommend.
408,2,"I absolutely despise leaving books unfinished. Usually I battle through them no matter how unpleasant it is. I almost dropped this book midway through. Almost.

So, it took me almost a year to read this, and it certainly wasn’t because of the language. The lightning thief just wasn’t my piece of cake. I gave it two stars because it did make me laugh and smile, and I definitely have read worse books.

Though, I’m not really this book’s target audience. If I would’ve gotten my hands on this series as a child, I’m certain I would’ve devoured it."
409,2,"I blame Tumblr & Pinterest memes for making me pick up the first book, and I blame my stupid, stupid need to finish a series for making me read to the tenth book. Maybe if I were a preteen, I would have liked them (they are YA novels after all). The writing annoyed me most - these could have been 2 trilogies if everything wasn't broken down and reexplained to death. Villains, Dionysius, & Nico made the books bearable; Coach & Piper made it not."
410,2,"Oompf: ääni joka lähtee kun jokin täynnä potentiaalia lysähtää alkutekijöissään. Mytologia on mahtava monisyinen alue, jolta ammentaa ja Riordan on onnistunut tuomaan nykyaikaan muutamia tuttuja hahmoja, mutta kun 12-vuotias nulikka peittoaa heittämällä ikiaikaisen sodan jumalan, menee maku tarinaan viimeistään. Ellei kammottavan huono kielenkäyttö ole tehnyt jo sitä ensimmäisillä sivuilla, kirjailija-setä nyt on yrittänyt vähän liikaa astuessaan esiteinin nahkoihin."
411,2,"DNF @ 55%

Well. I thought I would love this book! I love Harry Potter and I've been going through a fantasy kick, and all of the reviews are amazing.
I think a big part of it is where I am in my life, if I was in middle school I would have appreciated this book more. I didn't really feel for any of the characters and none of it really drew me in. The humor wasn't funny to me, and overall I just wasn't looking forward to finishing it. Oh well~"
412,2,"This series & author had been recommended to me plenty of times, so I finally checked it out. I was entertained by this book and can see why it's very popular. I have always loved Greek mythology so this was an interesting take on it. The book didn't capture me hook, line & sinker though so I don't think I'll continue this series right now. There's a definite possibility that I find myself thinking about the series down the road though and if that happens I'll pick up the next in the series."
413,2,"I feel like if I was younger I could have enjoyed it. But the plot moves around too quickly for me, too many things simply fall in to place to work and the writing... perhaps if the series was presented as a show/cartoon I would enjoy it, but as a book the writing is simple and bland. All of this combined with the fact that it relies on Greek Mythology to build a world instead of building it itself, leads to a disappointing book."
414,2,"I️ have mixed feelings about this book. I️ liked the characters, and I️ liked some of the adventures the three main characters embark on, but still it does not convince me. I️ think it is a read for kids, adults may not enjoy it as much. I️ went into this book thinking that I️ would have a similar experience as I️ had with Harry Potter, but not even close. It was a light read, what I️ needed in the moment, but I️ would not be reading the rest of the books in the series."
415,2,"This book was way too rushed. You're immediately thrown into this new world because the author can't wait to tell that story and thus you don't get enough back story to care about the characters. Then it's one problem after the next hurriedly thrown at the main character (Percy) until the end of the book, where they sneak in one last one because Rick can. This was not a smooth story and sad to see a unique concept like half-bloods be ruined by poor story-telling."
416,2,"Read this for the first time as a kid and didn’t like it, and I still do not like it as an adult All interesting adventure concepts are ruined by a baffling writing concept of “one adventure per chapter,” making a rushed, confused mess of a plot that goes nowhere besides a legitimately decent twist. There’s a good book hidden somewhere in here, and it steals just the right amount from Harry Potter to make it interesting enough to get through."
417,2,"Maybe I had heard too much good about this book and expected too much?
It did seem a lot like Harry Potter - lightning bolts, discovering powers, summer camp vs boarding school training, trio of hero, clever girl, and funny boy (although in different ways), Hagrid vs centaur. Most of the fight scenes were basically the troll scene from Harry Potter.
Like a loud american cousin to Harry Potter, but I didn't care for the hero half as much.
Two stars - it was okay."
418,2,"Et stærkt præmis, mange gode idéer og et frisk take på myterne... kunne ikke forhindre denne her bog i at være forfærdeligt underskrevet, ikke have nogen forståelse for dramaturgi eller opbyggelsen af spænding, samt et persongalleri, der var så kliché, at det til tider var helt pinligt at læse. At denne bog er beregnet til børn og unge teenagere er ingen undskyldning for dens svagheder, og det er en skam, for det ER et godt præmis."
419,2,"2 stars. Well, this was disappointing. Usually, I like ""the Chosen One"" type stories...but I don't know why Percy was even chosen. I've heard good things about this series. I guess I've read this plot pattern too many times, I might've enjoyed this 3 years ago. But it also felt a little pointless and hopeless, even accidental. Like the plot was just floundering around with no real moral purpose. I don't really want to read a series with a bunch of gods tossing around powers and the characters."
420,2,"My daughter loves these and is reading the series to me. I have nothing but great things to say about Rick Riordan as a person and how he's handled his literary clout to bring much needed diversity into his later series and especially for creating an imprint for more diverse voices in YA Fantasy. That being said, this is a sort of paint by numbers tale in the Harry Potter mold. Apparently his later series are better in their creativity."
421,2,"Unpopular opinion time
This story did next to nothing for me, I didn't like anyone (apart from hades), I didn't like the world or how the gods fitted into it. I feel the modern edge just ruined the wonder and greatness of Greek mythology.
Bad puns and cheesy one-liners made it worse. Plot twist was dull.
I struggled to get through it or even enjoy it.
Camp half-blood is not for me.
2 stars for hades and thalia though."
422,2,"It was okay. The writing wasn't great. The plot was predictable and, at times, very boring and/or embarrassing. There were not many good lessons in it to make up for some of the bad ones.

It was definitely creative, though. Had it been written better, it would have been a fun read. As it stands, I don't know if it's because I'm too old for it, but I doubt I'll ever care enough to read further into the series and wouldn't recommend it to others."
423,2,"The whole series is a little too childish for me (i am 25 yrs old) Most of the main characters are teenagers and they do think and act like one. Despite the fact that they keep making childish decisions and actions they end up saving the world again and again and it makes the story a little weak for me. I read this after I have finished Way of kings, mistborn and kingkiller chronicles and to be honest this one let me down a little bit despite it's super high rating."
424,2,"The reason I don’t LOVE this book is probably because I haven’t finished the series yet, and I also didn’t read it when I was young like most fans of it did. I liked the characters and the world, but I didn’t really love the way the plot moved forward. It felt like a bunch of random scenes squished together rather than a natural succession. I know that this series is really popular so I’m still continuing reading it. I have a feeling that I will appreciate this book more once I’m done."
425,2,
426,2,"It wasn't that interesting, this is the second time I read it and it was just as bad. I read it all in one day so my girlfriend would read the book I wanted her to read (It's sort of a game of who will win reading the book they don't want to.) I will be reading the next book out of guilt because I feel I didn't give it a fair chance. But I really didn't like it. Rick Riordan's writing was good, this just isn't my cup of tea."
427,2,"I have an unpopular opinion, but I personally liked the movie better than the book. Percy Jackson was never a series that intrigued me. This book does have a lot of great imagination and I think if I was younger I would have enjoyed it more. This would be a good book to recommend to a student who might be interested in greek gods or goddesses. That has never been an area that has been super interesting to me, which is probably why I didn't love the book. I do think this is a good book to recommend to students, it just wasn't for me."
428,2,
429,2,"I don't think I'm the target audience of this book. Percy acts alternatively like an adult or a petulant kid, at the convenience of the author. There is a fun bestiary and cast of characters, but it feels like a lesser version of Good Omens, American Gods, Small Gods, etc. There are moments that might be suspenseful if you don't know the underlying cast, like the appearance of Medusa, but they were all telegraphed enough to be predictable."
430,2,"I read this novel a long time ago and remember that even as a child I found it quite childish! The plot was not that interesting, the mythological references are certainly appreciable but also the only reason why I'm giving this book a few stars.
I don't think I'll continue reading this saga, I found very little character development and a repetitive modus operandi in the plot.
Maybe I'll give it a second chance in the future but not now..."
431,2,I wish had read this book as a kid. I wish I would have liked this book a lot more. I couldn't get past the writing style. I have a degree in history and greek anything has always been a chore to me... Should have expected that going into this book :( Sad that I didn't enjoy it like others... The betrayal at the end was good though... Even if I did spot it a third of the way into the book. Too predictable. But I will totally recommend it to the kiddos in my family.
432,2,Too many story similarities to Harry Potter to believe the author wasn’t trying to recreate it. It was like he took the story formula and plot points and attempted to put it into a Greek mythology hybrid. It was only ok. The characters were poorly developed and uninteresting and I just kept thinking that the author missed so many opportunities to make this great. Will read the second one and hope for better.
433,2,"I’m gonna be perfectly honest here, I am altogether unimpressed with this series as a whole. Don’t get me wrong, the idea is great, and the portrayal of the Greek gods in modern times is fun, but the book itself is not that great. The descriptions are confusing and awkward, the story itself is strange, and the characters are underdeveloped and rather hard to like sometimes. These books are fun to read for the first time in middle school, but that’s it."
434,2,
435,2,"For being a kids book the author describes very well without the reader being overwhelmed, it was an enjoyable story. Since I watched the movie I always wanted to read the books and now that I had the opportunity I’m disappointed that they left out a lot of scenes in the movie and changed almost all the story, nevertheless, it’s still a good movie and so is the book.

436,2,"I have finished with all the books in this series a long time ago and they are great but the thing is… well personally I like stories with less main characters, so even after reading all the books the story stays with you forever… but in this series there are just wayyy too many charactets so I only remember 30% of the books now… while u are reading them the storyline and adventures are great and keep you hooked but once u finish not much of it stays with you."
437,2,"It was an okay read, but ""meh"". Fantasy is one of my favorite genre, and I've read better books.
Hadn't read the series, though many had recommended that I do. Then my better half & I watched the movie.
After that, I read the book. Call it temptation to see what it was like. To put it simply, I liked the movie better.
Not likely I will read the series further, but I have watched the second movie, so might be ""tempted"". Who knows?"
438,2,"I'm all for reading middle-grade books as an adult, but this was NOT my jam. My biggest problem is that I don't like Percy. He is that annoying self-insert character in fics that I always hate. This makes me be overly critical to all other aspects of the book. I can see this book being fun to read as a kid - preferably a boy age 12-14 - and I guess it's a fun way to get acquainted with Greek mythology."
439,2,"This felt like a Harry Potter knock-off right from the start. I read maybe 120 pages and then flipped to the last 50. Nothing original here. This is YA, so I will say that I can see myself liking this a lot if I was in my early teens, but it doesn't do much for me now. It kind of felt like some teacher was trying to make the study of Greek mythology interesting to his class of 6th graders. It didn't work..."
440,2,"I guess this would’ve been better if I were in 5th grade. It’s the book that my high schoolers most often cite as the last book they enjoyed. I finally took the plunge, expecting a children’s book with some craft going for it. And it does have some, but every variable is plucked from Harry Potter and replaced with Greek mythology. Now, my students are saying the first one is the worst, and I gotta keep going, BUT I REFUSE!"
441,2,"I guess it's cool that kids get to engage with myths through this. As for my experience reading this: I really don't like going from action scene to action scene. Give me something to have thoughts about. Not a lot, but just something! I usually love training montages (in whatever medium), but this one was completely forgettable. Whenever I feel like the writer wrote a book just to pray that it will be made into a movie one day, I'm out. This was such a book."
442,2,I guess I'm too old for this series (33yo). I found Percy to be an obnoxious character and the story too predictable. I prefer books that have endearing characters so that I feel invested in whether the characters succeed. This was not one of those books. I'm sure that young readers and those young at heart will find this to be a delightful read. But I'll stick with Harry Potter and Tiffany Aching (by Terry Pratchett) when I feel like reading about young characters.
443,2,"I am way too old to be reading this book. I thought maybe it'd be like Harry Potter and I could ignore the fact the characters are kids. I couldn't.

The book was fine. It annoyed me how formulaic it was in the middle third. Go somewhere, find something out of the ordinary, get caught in a trap, have to escape. Ad infinitum.

I think I'll wait until I have kids of my own that I can read these books to rather than carry on myself."
444,2,"I think if I read this as a kid, I would've really enjoyed it. It was fun spotting the references to Greek mythology. The plot was kind of predictable and the character building was ok. I would like to learn more about Annabeth. I know Percy is the ""hero"" but it was unbelievable that
he was able to defeat Ares so easily. Also, Hades and the rest of the gods were so easily deceived."
445,2,"Poor man's American Harry Potter? I mean, was it necessary to actually make him a scrawny 12 yr old with black hair and green eyes? Also I realize I'm a grown adult reading a children's book, but WHERE are the adults here? Sending three CHILDREN off to travel across the US on their own, knowing they're being hunted by monsters? Not even remotely understandable logic. At least Dumbledore waited until Harry's 6th year before actively sending him off into danger."
446,2,This book… I’m not a fan of Greek mythology and I never will be it took me so long to pick up and read I didn’t even finish it. My friend has been recommending it to me for years so I bought it on a wimp. The idea of the story was good the writing was good too. I want to watch the movies even though lots of people say they are bad. I might come back to this book I might not we will have to wait and see but for now Percy Jackson is not for me.

Książka w porządku, ale żadnego zachwytu nie było. Prawdopodobnie gdybym przeczytała ją kilka lat wcześniej, to bardziej by mi się spodobała. Na pewno jest to dobra propozycja dla młodszych czytelników. Fabuła dość ciekawa, akcja też utrzymana w szybkim tempie, ale moim zdaniem nie umywa się to do serii o Harrym Potterze, do której często ta książka jest porównywana.
Myślę, że może jeszcze kiedyś sięgnę po kolejne części, gdy będę mieć ochotę na coś lekkiego i szybkiego w czytaniu."
448,2,"2.5 ⭐

Partiamo col dire che l'originalità dell'autore è tantissima e questa glielo riconosco. Mi dispiace perché questo libro per l'idea poteva essere molto di più ma la scrittura è molto povera e banale. Certe volte ci sono delle rotture della quarta parete un po' inopportune e l'incipit anche se sicuramente ha lo scopo di farti immedesimare non lo fa e peggiora il tutto. Non credo che questo libro meriti tutta la fama che ha e non so se leggerò gli altri libri della saga."
449,2,"Was excited to read this as I have always loved the movies but, as usual, it appears Hollywood took many liberties so there are very few similarities. Not surprised but this but I didn't realize how juvenile the book really was. The fact that the kids are so young really turned me off. I much prefer how they are portrayed in the films, though I suppose had I been a fan of the books as a kid I might feel the opposite. Oh well, now I know."
450,2,"I have absolutely no idea what all the hype is about. I was told this series is on par with Harry Potter...definitely not. The dialog is cringey, the characters are quite flat and contradictory at times, and the way they explain magic throughout the book is just awkward. I prefer the movie much more --- the gimmicky storyline involving 'modern' versions of Greek characters/places had a more intentional delivery on screen than on the page. Plus, you get to look at Logan Lerman for two hours."
451,2,"""The Lightning Thief"" is the thrilling first book in Rick Riordan's ""Percy Jackson & the Olympians"" series. Join Percy Jackson, a demigod with a witty sense of humor, as he embarks on an epic quest to prevent a war among the gods.

""The Lightning Thief"" would have been great when I was ten or so. Unfortunately, I am no longer ten, so I have aged out of a lot of the themes and jokes. I also have a good knowledge of Greek and Roman mythology, so the events were not often a surprise.
This would probably be a good book for late elementary school kids to middle teens, but it was a bit juvenile for me personally"
453,2,"Meh. Very cringey Harry Potter rip-off which requires A LOT of suspended disbelief on account of the reader. I might have been ok with the protagonist walking into one obvious trap, but the whole book is basically this on repeat. Ugh! Pretty maddening to be honest. It does have it's charm, but all in all it just feels like really lazy writing."
454,2,"It is either the fact that I read a bunch of Brandon Sanderson books around the same time as I was reading The Lightning Thief or I am just getting too old for the ""Young Adult"" genre in general (although I am still clinging to Harry Potter!). But I did not really enjoy reading this book. The story and characters felt much too shallow for my taste, so I will not pick up the sequels."
455,2,"2.5 stars. I love the Greek-myths-meet-Harry-Potter aspect, but there are a lot of annoying things that as an adult I find distracting. The emphasis on Grover eating like a goat. The out of place tween jokes. The quickness of the events. The weirdness of the normality of camp life (we had s'mores around the campfire""). Etc. The narrator wasn't my favorite, either. My five year old loved it."
456,2,"I was hot and cold with this book. Parts of it were very clever and unique. But the monster aspect grew monotonous and boring. I knew this book was fantasy. I knew it would be unbelievable. But that didn't deter me. Unfortunately, it was too over-the-top. This was too much for a sixth grader to undertake, over and over. I won't continue on with this predictable series."
457,2,"Wow, I wanted good things but was I wrong. This was a “paint by number” mythology. Go down the list and check off the known monsters and archetypes. If you want to read about humans and Gods, read Gaiman, Green and or Hearne. Leave this tripe for little kids who have no concept of plot, foreshadowing or subtlety."
458,2,"Not really sure what I was expecting when I picked this one up. Always on the lookout for the next Harry Potter, I had heard and read a great deal about this series and thought of giving it a try. Very disappointed at the end. Immature and kiddish writing all through and the characters have no depth whatsoever. Cannot hold a candle to potter."
459,2,"Don't read this as an adult. I was expecting a well-crafted JK Rowling-level story aimed at children and instead what I got was a disappointing 2-bit blatant Harry Potter knock-off that reads like it was written by a 5th grader. Maybe I would have liked it better as a kid, but it still stole 70% of the material from the Harry Potter books and that's just not cool."
460,2,This would be so much better if the adults weren't so mean. Literally every adult is a dick except Percy's mom & she's not great either. I've been listening to a lot of YA fantasy lately & this is missing something. The dialog never really seems believable. But the Greek myth nerd in me was pleased with all the connections.
461,2,"Sometimes these middle grade books can grab you with cool adventures and clever twists, but this wasn't one of them. It's certainly no Harry Potter, but having just recently read City of Ghosts, it just didn't measure up."
462,2,"Good premise but I found it hard to read due to the very poor writing. It felt like it was written by a 12 year old, not for a 12 year old. I recognize that it is a kid's book but that doesn't mean it should be clunky. Fortunately, I'm very easily entertained so I didn't hate it. I'm also glad the movie increased Percy's age. Percy needed some more maturing."
463,2,i kinda liked this book. the characters were well and i felt like i knew them. i don’t think i want to watch the movies because everyone says how shit they are! this book is a bit too childish for me (i’m 17) and i don’t think i want to read the other ones. it was really predictable and i hate books like that. :/
464,2,"This book was a lot of fun, and I loved the tone of it, but because it's aimed for younger audiences it just didn't really click for me. It is also, unfortunately, one of those books that assumes you know the geography of America. A redeeming quality: Sally Jackson killing her abuser and selling his body for money. Truly iconic of her.

2 hero quests out of 5"
465,2,"Yeah, this book was not my cup of tea. I don’t blame the author tho, because this type of genre is not for me.

I wanted to read something out of my comfort zone and it did not end up so well.

The writing was easy and straightforward. I always wondered about the history of the greek gods and this book gave me a fascinated brief about it!"
466,2,"A weak start, poorly written characters, lack of detail when it comes to descriptions and it doesn’t use it’s greek strengths until the end. While it is quite flawed The Lighting Thief is a enjoyable easy read and while it starts off weak it does get stronger especially towards the end. It works as a great buffer between more serious reads."
467,2,"Read for #romanceopoly 2020 Journey's End and #makeyourmythtake 2020 Witch Path :Magical Battle prompt

After hearing all the praise I honestly thought I would like it better. It was just ok. I've read better middle grade and better YA. Maybe it's just a product of it's time for it's genre that makes it so hyped up.

FWIW: Harry Potter is way better in this non potterhead's opinion."
468,2,"I think I read this way too late in my life and so I couldn't get past the simple writing style, the plot just felt predictable to me, and I didn't connect with any of the characters. I also don't like mythology so I didn't enjoy that aspect. Maybe if I read this in middle school, I would have really enjoyed it. Will not read the rest of the series."

Na każdym etapie swojej podróży napotykają na przeszkody, co w pewnym momencie uczyniło z każdego kolejnego rozdziału walkę z przeciwnikiem; było to dość męczące. Dodatkowo książka jest bardzo przewidywalna."
471,2,"I really thought this would be better! Not terrible, for a children’s book. I did NOT like how much ADHD was glamorised as a super power. And the plot seemed a little implausible. I suppose for a kids book... it was younger than I was expecting. And darker! Very little emotion but lots of abandonment. Meh, could have been better."
472,2,"A felénél vettem észre (ill. mondta is @noncsemma), hogy ez egy tinikönyv, így már értettem, hogy miért van ennyire lebutítva ez-az (pl. karakterfejlődés) benne. A sztori közepes, nem igazán élveztem, egyszálas, lineáris szájbarágás. Értem, hogy nem én vagy a célcsoport 33 évesen, de ha már végigolvastam, kénytelen vagyok jelen helyzetemből értékelni."
473,2,"Percy Jackson is the literary equivalent of rock music in the soundtrack of a period piece movie. It does not hold up to adults, and if you disliked the movie, the book isn't much better. That said, Rick Jordan is a very skilled writer, and it shows. This book wasn't for me, but I could have loved it had I read it as a child."
474,2,"A quick easy read. I feel that it was more geared for younger readers as the writing style was pretty simplistic and some big reveals were clear beforehand.

Although this may seem like a negative review, I would definitely recommend it for readers new to Greek myths. It's definitely a literary world away from the Odyssey though!"
475,2,"Entiendo que es un libro infantil, peor me ha parecido demasiado episódico. Aunque es muy interesante el tratamiento y uso de la mitología no es suficiente para mantener el interés. Me parece que la trama tiene agujeros grandes y los personajes son demasiado arquetípicos (cuando leía sobre le trío protagonista no podía evitar imaginarme a Harry, Ron y Hermione)."
476,2,"It was alright, but the information is very unrelated to Greek mythology. I think if you’re younger or prefer easier reading material you might like this, but as someone who read it in the seventh grade, I found it very easy and often annoying to read. I think if it was written in a different writing style I would have liked it, but I just can’t stand the way Riordan writes."
477,2,"I'm really late to the party with this one, and I'm no longer in middle school, which I think is sort of the target age demographic for this book, but yeah it was okay. Honestly I really hated the talkative narration thing that Percy had going on, but the world concept was fun and I'm still going to try and read the rest of the books in the series."
478,2,"Maybe I'd love this book if I read it as a kid, but as an adult this mostly felt like Rick Riordan took every random idea that popped into his head and strung them together into a series of plot contrivances for his uninteresting characters to stumble through. It's fun enough, but it mostly made me wish I was reading more Madeline Miller."
479,2,"I didn’t really like this book until the third act. It took me much longer than I would’ve liked to finish this just because of how boring I found it.

However the last bit I found really exciting and I’m definitely going to check out the sequel now that the world building is done for the most part"
480,2,"Percy learns that his father is Posideon, the god of Greek legend. He goes to a camp with other half-gods and makes friends along the way. After being accused of stealing Zeus's lightning bolt, Percy is sent on an adventure to prove himself innocent.

I did not like this book or this series. Every chapter heading tells you the most exciting thing that will happen in the chapter before you have read it, taking away all of the suspense. All of the characters are written as condescendingly daft, and the book feels like it was written by a dyslexic teen. Riordan can do better.

Warning: I don't recommend this book with all of the better young adult fantasy books to read."
481,2,"Me gustaban mucho en mis años mozos, pero ahora le veo muchas lagunas al concepto. Me parece un poco propaganda imperialista el hecho de que los dioses escojan USA, por tener este la hegemonía sobre el resto de países. En fin, que se me hace un análisis bastante pobre.
Por lo demás, es un libro correcto para niños y preadolescentes."
482,2,"I remember wanting to read this when I was younger (I have no idea why I never did), but as a greek mythology lover I found this… lacking and rather disappointing. The story is interesting, for sure; but the characters were very two dimensional imo and the greek mythology portions are just skimmed through. Won’t be continuing with the series/ would rather re-read the Odyssey."
483,2,"series q no voy a seguir y por que

influida x la popularidad del libro (y por haberlo leido traducido) siento q es medio una cagadita.

es medio boludo, en partes me aburrió y en partes pensé qué es lo q tenia de interesante y particular esta historia y no se me ocurrió nada. será tmb que no me interesa particularmente la mitologia griega entonces ://"
484,2,This book was very disappointing. I expected more from it. It made me upset and it totally felt like the plot was stolen from Harry potter. It was like Harry Potter mixed with mythology made cringy. Sadıy. 2 stars only because it was not good. The only good character was Annabeth. Overall this book was not good and I don't reccomend it
485,2,"This isn’t the worst thing I have ever read and I can see why kids enjoy it, but I’m definitely not the target audience, and I was expecting that, but I was hoping it would be like an early Harry Potter book or a Disney movie where it’s technically for kids but it’s purposely made so any age can enjoy it. It is not like that. It’s very clearly just for kids"
486,2,idk. I just had such high hopes for this book since I liked the movie and literally EVERYONE said this book was so good. but you can just tell it was written for kids. the problems they faced for solved so easily and they jumped from place to place it felt like. I ended up skimming the last 20 pages cause it just would not end :/
487,2,"2.5
I’m sad I didn’t love this as much as I wanted to or thought I would. It just didn’t fully click with me. I probably would have enjoyed it a little more if I had read it for the first time as a child.
I will be continuing the series, because I want to see where it goes from here, how the characters develop, etc."
488,2,"le doy dos estrellas ahora, porque en su momento ya lo leí y me ha aburrido un poco repetir la historia, no me ha emocionado nada, me da pena en verdad, no quiero ser mayor :( Pero bueno, a ver si sigo con los demás libros, porque siento curiosidad por cómo crecen los personajes y hay que ponerse al día para la nueva serie que espero que sea muy buena."
489,2,"The story follows the adventures of Percy Jackson, a twelve-year-old boy who discovers that he is a demigod the son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea. When Percy's mother is kidnapped by the vengeful god Zeus, he embarks on a dangerous quest to retrieve a stolen lightning bolt that Zeus believes Poseidon has stolen."
490,2,"I can see how fantasy-hungry kids during Harry Potter's hype era would gravitate towards this book, and I could've been one of those kids, but I wasn't. Reading it as an adult felt a mix of cringe towards the ""childish humor"" and confusion towards the many references to Greek mythology. And perhaps this is my adult mind, but I would have been even more confused as a teen/tween than I was now."
491,2,"I fully recognize that this was written close to 20 years ago and I am a 32 year old lady. This was okay, I won't judge the series just based on the first book. I'm sure the stakes get higher and there's more character development as time goes on. I'll keep reading, but now it just might not at the top of my TBR."
492,2,An action packed book with a 12 year old boy. Percy had no personality besides begin a son of a god. He loves his mom and then he's given a quest. Predictable but not in a clever or impressive way. I'd probably stick around for Annabeth but she wasn't given a chance either. I'd like to expand here more but I just want to put this book behind me.
493,2,"1: I don't buy the protagonist being 12, not even a little bit. At least 16, and every time the book tells me otherwise I'm just like ""Liar.""

2: Hero story -- all characters are more or less irrelevant, including the protagonist.

3: Lots of Greek monsters for fans of them.

Meh, it's all right."
494,2,"To be honest, I LOVE the way Rick Riordan writes, but this book just didn't stick with me, neither did the rest of the books in this series (besides the fifth book). I preferred The Heroes of Olympus. This book felt too repetitive and it got pretty boring for me."
495,2,"Basically just moves from one action scene to the next, which… needs some breathing room. There were some funny moments and a decent incorporation of Greek mythology into the modern world, but overall it was just mediocre."
496,2,"Being neither a child nor a fantasy lover, it is not surprising I didn't love this book. I do however appreciate that these books and this author are well loved. I imagine my boys will enjoy them very much when they're old enough, it's just not my thing."
497,2,"This book was not that great. In my opinion, this book was to slow paced and the storyline bored me to death and I was ready to be done. I would recommend this to anyone who likes books that are about Greek mythology."
498,2,"It was a good read, light hearted and enjoyable but i felt that it was lacking in some aspects. The character development could be improved on but i think that comes along with the continuation of the series."
499,2,"I thought this book was absolutely boring. the beginning is slow, and it seems like the plot goes on forever, and is hard to follow along with. i do not recommend this book to people that get bored easily"
500,2,It was ok but just not my cup of tea. I liked Percy as a character but the plot felt a little scattered. Maybe I just didn't read this book at the right age but I didn't feel connected to the story. I'm still debating about continuing to read the next book.
501,2,"I swear I read this book, maybe I just watched the movie. Anyway, I read another Riordan series and it was the same exact story. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't always bother me, but I must just care less about this one."
502,2,This is a book one of a young-adult fantasy series that resembles Harry Potter in certain ways though with a mythology theme. I own all 5 books but have not read them in a long time. It was OK but does not deserve to sit on my shelf now that I'm more discerning about what books I keep.
503,2,"I would have loved this as a twelve year old, and I can see why high school teachers cream themselves over this book (foreshadowing! Mythological parallels! Learning disabilities framed as strengths!). Alas, not doing it for me at this point of my life. Might pick up the sequels though."
504,2,"Ugh. Reading it to catch up with J, we are supposed to read the series together. Just a bit worse than I expected but glad to see the mythology work its way into the series in a new way. Definitely super unfair to even review a kids book after reading Madeline Miller and Neil gaiman..."
505,2,I'm kind of surprised this book is so popular. I found it cheesy and rolled my eyes at how often things just happened to work out so easily. The only reason I gave it two stars was because it was obviously well researched. I learned a lot about Greek mythology.
506,2,"Not bad at all, though I feel a bit too old to thoroughly enjoy these. I probably would have devoured them when I was younger. It was pretty rad to read an explicitly ADHD protagonist, with a canonical in-universe explanation for how he's hardwired that way and uses it to his advantage!"
507,2,I read this because my daughter loved this book as a middle schooler and continues to reread and enjoy it. I thought it was OK. I couldn't muster much empathy for the main character but I enjoyed the imagination of the author.
508,2,"Rick Riordan is apparently not a very good writer. A lot of his writing is, in fact, a bit painful. Even so, he managed to create a halfway decent story that worked well for my being in a mood for a book that didn't require much effort on behalf of the reader."
509,2,"2,5/5
Me gustan Percy, Annabeth y Grover, aunque al principio no los soportaba.
El libro en sí me ha dejado un poco fría pero claro, es un libro introductorio. Con ganas de seguir con la saga. :D

#TeamHades"
510,2,"After two years I finally finished it , the book seemed a lot like Harry Potter which I didn’t like , i was expecting something different and more epic to be honest , I enjoyed reading it most of the time though"
511,2,"An easy, fast-paced read. Not my favorite, but a nice mental break. The Greek mythology based YA I enjoyed when I was in late middle and early high school was that series about the muses by Clea Hantman.
I think I found this a bit awkward largely because of the target reader level."
512,2,"I hate giving this 2 stars- it's completely my fault for not reading it until 19 and after the films making it seem like every event was so disjointed and just like a checkpoint for each scene to take place, and obviously a childish writing style because it's meant for 12 year olds. Sorry."
513,2,I expected to like it more based on what others had said. Thought it was pretty cheesy and predictable. Tried to hard it seemed. Maybe it’s just because I don’t like the Greek Mythology stuff. Not interested in reading sequels.
514,2,"2.3 stars
A little problematic
A little too influenced by Harry Potter
But nonetheless a fun and engaging set up
I hope it’s just a case of first book syndrome and the world and character building grows"
515,2,"this kinda sucked monkey balls ☹️ rick riordans writing style feels so forced along w the voice of percy, it just does not come off right ???? worldbuilding kind of swag but i cant enjoy this book because of how hard it’s obvious riordan tried to sound hip"
516,2,"I wanted to enjoy this book so badly.
Both my kids talk continuously about Percy Jackson and have been reading them for some time. But I didn't enjoy it. I didn't like the characters and I felt the whole story was predictable and boring. So disappointed"
517,2,Finale (e non solo) spoilerato a pagina 50 con una profezia che può sembrare sibillina solo se hai perso facoltà cognitive. Io devo averle scambiate con una nocciolina quando ho deciso di leggere questo libro.
518,2,"Wanted some easy reading during a tough week, but why are Americans so obsessed with blaming wars on ancient gods

Plus the whole perspective of America being the heart of western civilization is disturbing at best"
519,2,"Es un libro bastante obvio para donde iba y aburrido. También, algunos mitos que se cuentan son modificados para conveniencia de la trama. Igualmente, creo que me hubiera gustado si lo hubiera leído mucho antes."
520,2,"Listened to the audiobook with the kids. While having a slightly nasal-sounding teenage voice was accurate given the first person writing style, it was grating at times, especially when it veered into Mary Sue levels of being awesome at everything."
521,2,"No me gusto mucho, me intereso la historia, pero creo que no es mi momento para comenzar otra saga con muchos libros, porque estoy en un paro ya que termine de leer la saga HP, asi que por ahora no lo voy a seguir, a lo mejor mas adelante.
J.
PD:Me encantaron los personajes principales :)."
522,2,"Drama Adolescienziale, sulla perdita della madre e i vari rapporti con i genitori.Non mi è piaciuto granché ma sicuramente se lo avessi letto a 11 o 12 anni mi sarebbe piaciuto tantissimo. Penso che sia importante nella storia del fantasy ma adesso mi risulta molto fuori target. 5/10"
523,2,"I read this series when I was much younger and really enjoyed it, but just three years ago I went back and reread it and didn't like it whatsoever. I think that it was definitely geared towards younger children."
524,2,"God I could not get into it. I wanted a world I could get lost in like Harry Potter. This was not it. Got halfway through and had enough. Did not care about the main character at all, or any of the characters for that matter. On to the next."
