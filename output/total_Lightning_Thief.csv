0,1,1,"EDIT 09/06/2013:- That's it. I have had my fill of too many stupid, brain-cell destroying comments posted on this review in the past few months asking me to write a 'best-selling book' before attempting to take apart Rick Riordan's writing. As if the exclusive privilege of negatively criticizing a book is accorded only to published writers and not ordinary reviewers/readers.
I do have the right to record my feelings about a book in my review. And it's such a shame that I am actually being forced to put up this edit to make people aware of this fact. If this review hurts your sentiments as a fan, I am sorry I can't help you there. You must grow up and learn to let dichotomous opinions co-exist in harmony on the same page. That is all.

Brutal honesty ahead. Read at the expense of having to respect someone else's views.

---------

What a feeble attempt at recreating the Harry Potter magic! Aside from being highly unoriginal and unimaginative, the book grates on your nerves due to the frequency of Percy's lame attempts at sounding witty. Seriously, I'm supposed to laugh at his observations on the and ?
Not only did the writer not bother racking his brains to come up with a plot or a proper story, choosing instead to recycle key elements of the Harry Potter series, but he also ignored important aspects of a fantasy novel, one of which is the language. To call the narration just bad will be an understatement. Same can be said about the dialogue and the way the plot progresses - it's one cliched event unfolding after another.
The only novel thing about this book is the seamless integration of Greek mythology into a fantasy-based set-up. The 1 star is for that.
And so I'd like to put a premature end to my review because I just realized the futility of writing one of a book I hated."
1,2,1,
2,3,1,"I posted a scathing review of this book when I first read it - 13 years ago now! - while I was studying children's lit at uni. I kept getting narky comments from Percy Jackson fans with hurt feelings, so I decided to re-read the book and update my review. I stand by a lot of the things I said, but I've tried to express my views in a milder manner in order to avoid the PITCHFORKS (or should I say tridents, ho ho) from Team Percy.

With all the lofty maturity and perspective gained since 2010, I concede that it's probably not that bad. It's a quick easy read, fast-paced and entertaining, with a lot of wish-fulfillment-type stuff about an underdog kid getting his own back against bullies and singlehandedly taking on a bunch of monsters with great success. I can see why it's popular and I've happily recommended it to students before, despite my personal prejudice! But I still didn't love it, and I maintain that there are some things about it that are annoying.

Comparisons to the Harry Potter series are pretty inevitable considering when the book was published, which the author acknowledged in . Riordan said that Percy Jackson was 'in many ways' influenced by Harry Potter, and went on to defend some of the key similarities as drawing on the same mythology and containing the same universal themes. This is true, and perfectly legitimate. I have no problem with authors taking inspiration from the canon of existing literature - all fiction is essentially derivative, blah blah. I'm not going to whinge that he referenced the same mythological 3-headed dog (Cerberus/Fluffy) or used some of the same themes (hero's quest). The similarities I'm thinking of are more specific details. Things like:
• the trio of main characters includes a special chosen one with green eyes and black hair, his somewhat useless but funny & loyal best friend, and a smart/competent girl with curly hair.
• Percy/Harry has to stay with a horrible mortal/muggle relative (Gabe/the Dursleys) for his protection (scent/blood magic)
• Upon learning that he is special and not just unlucky, he goes to a magical school, invisible to mortals/muggles (Camp Half Blood/Hogwarts), where he is again under magical protection.
• The students are sorted into teams and there's one noticeably evil team (Ares/Slytherin). There's a strong rivalry between the evil team and the team our hero is on, which leads to fierce competition in games (Capture the flag/Quidditch)
• One of the main antagonists (Clarisse/Draco) is from the evil team, and we later find out has a bit of a bully for a dad (Ares/Lucius)
• The hero finds he can understand a language without learning it (Ancient Greek - and also speaking to horses/Parseltongue)
• An ordinary muggle train station takes you to the entrance of Mt Olympus/Hogwarts.
• The main villain (Kronos/Voldemort) has been in a weakened or near-defeated state due to being ripped into pieces but is regaining power
• There is a prophecy saying (Percy/Harry) will defeat (Kronos/Voldemort) - but it could refer to someone else.
• Some very similar phrasing at times, for example in the scene where the mean teacher (Mr D/Snape) greets (Percy/Harry) by sneering ""well well, our little celebrity"". And the term ""half-blood"". Personally, I think he should have gone with ""demigod"", which is both a cooler word AND a more accurate description of what they are.

I'm not saying I think Riordan intentionally set out to rip Harry Potter off. I just suspect he had the book in his memory when writing and subconsciously mimicked some aspects. HOWEVER, I freely accept that others may consider the similarities either coincidental or sufficiently different to render them unique.

Another thing I mentioned in my original review was the link between ugliness and evil. This still stood out to me on a second reading - possibly only because I remembered it and was looking for it. Some examples are Percy's bully Nancy Bobofit, who has ""crooked teeth"" and ""orange freckles like she's been sprayed with liquid Cheetos"" and has a posse of ""ugly friends"", Clarisse is a ""big ugly girl"" who looks like she ""wears a size XXXL shirt"" and has ""stringy hair"" and ""ugly pig eyes"". The Ares team is full of the ""biggest and ugliest kids"", who live in an ""ugly red cabin"" and their table gives ""an ugly cheer"". Percy's horrible stepdad Gabe's last name is Ugliano and he is described as ugly, balding & overweight. In a combat Percy refers to his opponents as ""Ugly One, Ugly Two"" etc. Meanwhile, Annabeth is ""pretty"" with ""curly blonde hair like Cinderella"" and Percy is a ""good-looking kid"" and has a ""handsome"" face. To be fair, this book certainly isn't the only culprit, but I don't think it's a particularly good message. It probably resonates with preteens, at that age they might find it satisfying to have ugliness sneered at without being told it's unkind/unfair.

I still found Percy a bit too effortlessly awesome. He's often described as guessing or instinctively knowing what to do, without having to come up with ideas, especially in battle. Feeling angry causes him to channel some sort of combat mode where he can perform skills he's never practiced, such as when he disarms Luke in training. ""My body thought for me"" he'll say as he ducks a fatal blow then makes a wild unplanned swing with his sword that somehow not only connects but slices a monster in half. He can beat Ares, the actual god of war, in one-on-one combat. He can saunter into the Underworld without any kind of plan, bribe his way in with money and flattery, have a casual chat to Hades, and then escape with his two friends unharmed. He automatically understands Ancient Greek because his brain is ''hardwired'' for it, and can speak to horses because his father created them. He often has a feeling of danger or a sense that something's wrong (although he never acts on this and plunges in anyway, every. single. time.) and guesses or figures out stuff based on VERY scant evidence. I mean yes, it makes sense in the fiction - he's a demigod, so he's supposed to be born with supernatural powers - but I think it makes him a shallower and less interesting character. In general, I thought the action moved on a bit too quickly to leave much time for any deep conversations or character development, but that's a complaint I often have about teen fiction. I think a lot of authors incorrectly assume their audience won't have the patience for a slower and more thoughtful pace.

My final complaint - a NEW one! - was that I didn't buy the underlying premise. The ancient Greek gods are still around but have moved with the times, hide most of their doings from mortals now using 'Mist', and shift their headquarters to wherever the ""pinnacle of western civilization"" is (America, natch) but they've kept all the same customs, weapons, language, building styles etc that they had in Greece. Well, ok, but what about all the gods of other ancient civilizations? Baal, Ra, Thor, Ishtar, Brahma, Shangti - were they also real? Are they other names for the same guys? Why did they choose to go with the Greek theme if they existed before and after that time? It was never explained. Maybe he'll talk about it in one of the next books in the series but I don't intend to read them so I'll never know.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Was forced to read this lame American rip-off of Harry Potter for my children's lit course. Almost everything about it irritated me deeply - the cheesy humour, Percy's effortless awesomeness and lack of any actual character depth or personality, the concept of 'inborn' knowledge like understanding ancient Greek, the constant info-dumps from other characters explaining things to Percy. And how many times did R.Riordan want to push the UGLINESS=EVIL point? Every SINGLE time the stereotypically and pointlessly evil Aries group were mentioned the word 'ugly' was used to describe them, even if a cheer went up from their table it was 'an ugly cheer'. And Percy's smelly stepdad Gabe's surname is 'UGLIano', oh yes very subtle. I wanted to get a pen and paper out and start a running tally of the obvious Harry Potter references - I won't list them because there are TOO MANY TO COUNT, but my favourite was when one of the teachers actually said to him: ""Percy Jackson... our little celebrity""."
3,4,1,"Badly written and very sexist. Evil is synonymous with ugly and fat. Girls Percy doesn't like are all described as ugly and masculine (and it is made sure that the reader knows that masculine traits in a girl or a woman mean that she is evil).

And you would not think it possible to turn Greek mythology into conservative American nationalism, but Riordan managed even that.

If you are looking a book to buy for a teenager, do get them something else. Most bricks are better literature than this."
4,5,1,"Now before you jump on my case, one star simple means ""I didn't like it."" Two stars is ""It was ok,"" which is not accurate to my feelings. The Lightning Thief isn't an awful book, it's just not any good. The concept is creative, but the writing is so sloppy, the dialogue so lame/awkward, and the plot so forced, that what you end up with is the most unimpressive Potter knock-off you can manage. I'll be honest, I hate Twilight but I think even that book is better balanced than this one. Riordan is sometimes even offensive. While the adherence to the canonical myth takes liberties which I think are fine, the Greeks themselves get the shaft. The spirit of the mythology is robbed, replaced with a kind of Ami-Greek hybrid that labels the Upper West side the center of the universe. It may sound trite, overly sensitive, but honestly, it really hurts the integrity of the mythos (ha ha) of Riodan's world.
Percy himself is annoying, the characters are stock, the feelings often forced or nonexistant. Fantastic things happen but carry no weight, and the thunder that follows allusions to the great pantheon is cheesy to say the least. I walked out on Jackson a quarter of the way in."
5,6,1,"Who knew the category of young adult books aimed at boys was such a wasteland? I've been disappointed by Eoin Colfer and now this supposedly award-winning series by Rick Riordan.
The premise is clever but as many other readers have noted, it is pretty much a Harry Potter rip-off. In one scene, Percy (the hero) sees a guard reading a thick book with a wizard on the cover which he thinks must be good because the guard takes a while to respond. Percy himself, we are told, doesn't care for fantasy. Well, he might plead ignorance of JK Rowling but you can be sure the author has patterned his entire series on the boy-wizard books. Whereas Rowling offered young boys and girls the best of fiction and literature, Riordan and Colfer dish up tired, cliched action-packed adventures. The narrator mustn't pause in the action for a second to talk or think too long before plunging his sword into the next monster. Also, Rowling obviously did a lot of research on her subject and it is clear Riordan didn't when we find lazy errors sprinkled throughout the narrative (e.g. he mistakenly calls Nemesis a god instead of a goddess).
Aside from the bad writing, I struggled with the political ideology of this book. Let's leave aside the fact that there are no characters of color. I just finished reading a novel by a real Greek author called Middlesex and it is an interesting comparison between the candid, all-inclusive, racially and sexually diverse elements in that story versus the narrow world of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. But I think the big glaring problem no one has mentioned is that Riordan has some serious issues with women. Practically every woman character is evil. The only two good women are self-sacrificing defenders of the old patriarchic order. Violence against women is not simply tolerated--it is encouraged. Considering this is a postmodern twist on the old myths (incredibly rich, layered myths to which Riordan does an extreme disservice), the reader might expect that we hear about Medusa from a sympathetic perspective or about the Furies' version of their role as defenders of mother-right.
I feel sad for the young boys out there who are making do with this kind of book and its ilk. No wonder they'd rather play video games than read books. With cheap stories like this, it amounts to the same thing. They deserve better."
6,7,1,"Somebody please tell me that a twelve year old who just saw his mother being kidnapped won't go around making jokes. Okay, I don't mind a few jokes, but i don't want a joke as big as this book. It actually took me over a year, after once starting it, to develop courage to finish it.

The first person account is one of most annoying things in the book, which twelve year old talks like that - I don't think Rick has it to enter psychology of a twelve year old. No wonder the guy in movie wasn't twelve year old; I mean honestly has the author a kid in all his life.

If you ignore for once the little trivia about Greek gods (which I shall criticize shortly), it is just a shameless coping, no, an insult, of Harry Potter series. If anything, it goes on to show, why Harry Potter is more than just a adventure story. Besides the little adventures, HP was full of allegorical references (to real world), wonderful characters and beautiful writing. She had managed to enter the psychology of both children and adults like no one else can. HP created in one a philosophy that can act as basis for a child to form attitudes towards such things like death, drugs, good or evil, hunger for power. This one has nothing of that. There is no way for example, that it would come so intriguing a character as Snape or such wonders as Platform Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.

It is just how timid mind of a gamer would have seen HP - fights and pranks. Just think of it, a monster doesn't die, if you kill it; and will come back to haunt. Isn't that the kind of thing, that happens in video games?

Now the only argument in favor of book was connections it made to Greek goods. Here are four replies that can be made against it:

1. The basic system is stolen from HP - full time school became summer school, Greek creatures rather than magical ones and so on.

2.Anyone in our generation knows about Greek gods, there are video games and movies all over places, and it is internet age friends. Hades actually looks like same character from Disney cartoon series 'Hercules'.

3. This is most important argument, it was stupid. I mean just give it a thought - 'spirit of western civilization', I mean are you kidding me. what about eastern, northern and southern civilizations - do they have gods too? and if these children of gods are so undesired, how come they are called heroes? What about children gods would have with goddesses? Will they be immortal? because in that case, we must have a population explosion of gods.

I normally don't care about logic that much, if it is a good story but it is just nonsense redefined. I mean, I never asked the logic of wands in HP but that was because Rowling made it look real.

Yes, it is a best seller but that doesn't make it a great book, does it? HP fans were hungry for more and so switched to sub-prime authors. And don't tell me that i'm too old to like it, I read children books all the same. I could go on criticizing the book but i don't see any point in doing that.

Instead of reading it, I would recommend reading HP; and if you have read it, read it again and if you have already read it twice; just give it one more reading - it would still have much more in it than Percy Jackson."
7,8,1,"I'm not going to win myself any friends from Percy Jackson's legions of fans with this review. Remember that it's just, like, my opinion, man. Now, I have harbored a love of Greek mythology since I was in elementary school and I found a book of such in my school library. I loved it so much, I am sorry to say that I stole it! Fortunately the statute of limitations has elapsed on that particular crime. I looked forward to seeing how this material was wielded in this extremely popular series, so popular that even over a dozen years later, my library can't keep any of its 14 print copies on the shelf, not to mention other formats.

First, the good: . Pretty rad name for a sword.

Then, the less good: the low reading level, the poor humour, the tired formula.

I can't fault the reading level on its own; it's not the book's fault that it was below my expectations. I thought a book and series that was such a breakout hit would be on par with Harry Potter in literary appeal. As it is, I found this to be merely a step above early-reader chapter books. I do not consider this a middle-grade book, rather I judge it to be for older elementary children in terms of reading comprehension. But of course, whoever enjoys it is free to do so, regardless of their age. I found it over-simplified, shallow, and devoid of dramatic tension. It is also supremely formulaic. Take the main party; the boy chosen-one, the goofy, underwhelming boy sidekick, and the competent female second sidekick who is the only one who actually worked hard to earn her place. We have seen this arrangement endless times before. The novel's opening and set-up uses extremely tired narrative techniques. The main character lacks any distinctive personality. Action scenes are random, with poor use of the source material. Supposedly humorous sections fall flat. The driving broader threat, that a war between gods would devastate the earth, is mostly told, not shown or felt by the reader, who has to manufacture interest in the characters' success independently. Overall, I thought the writing was lazy. I attribute a large portion of the book's (and subsequent Riordan publishing empire's) success to a powerful marketing campaign, rather than inherent quality.

And last, the questionable or disturbing: for one, Percy labels himself as dyslexic and ADHD, but does not appear to suffer any of the hardships that actual kids with these diagnoses would encounter. This does a disservice to those who legitimately struggle with these. Similarly, the issue of domestic physical abuse was approached far too casually, and

I don't begrudge anyone who has fond memories of this book, or any of the kids who enjoy it, but there are so many significantly better children's fantasy series out there that are vastly more original and that don't dumb down writing for children.

I do caution any parents to be aware of the need for a conversation about domestic abuse (and murder!) if your kids jump on this bandwagon."
8,9,1,"I read about 50 pages in. Not one character was likable to me, but I was willing to continue UNTIL...Riordan went on his imperialist gloss about 'Western civilization' being the most important in history. Seriously offended my postcolonial sensibilities. I couldn't continue with no characters to like and the author spewing his personal idiocy."
9,10,1,"If I were to add this book at the top of any list, it would be on a list entitled 'Weird, Random, and Stupid'.

Don't start jumping to the conclusion that I don't know my Greek mythology. I do. And I actually thought this book was going to be awesome.
First off, in my experience, any book with the word thief on the cover must be good (), so a thief sounded very promising.
Second, I've decided I would not jump to conclusions on books before I've even read them (my mistake with series, which I was totally ready to hate simply because everyone else in my class liked them and because Stephenie Meyer liked them).
And third, having recently read for the very first time and still feeling very sad I finished it, I really needed another book series to get obsessed over (I'm actually still reading , but it's in pdf form and frankly I can't stand reading off my laptop).
So it was. I was given two days by the librarian to finish it, which is probably the only reason I did finish it so quickly. I wasn't exactly having the time of my life while reading it.

I just couldn't get around the absolutely mediocre narrative. It literally sounded like an eleven-year-old wrote it (I ought to know, since at eleven I tried writing my own novel and it sounded almost exactly like Rick Riordan). I don't like books that are too easy to read.
I also don't like books that aren't very subtle. As in, where everything starts happening too fast and the protagonist just takes it in stride. I really think this book would've been a little bit more bearable if it had set Percy as already having been a member of Camp Half-Blood. It could've been about Percy being an outcast at the camp of demigods because no one has been able to figure out who his father is. In my opinion, if the author has way too many incredible and inexplicably impossible things to explain to the main character, then they should just make it so that the main character already knows about all of it. This would be the equivalent of Harry Potter growing up knowing he was a wizard and how his parents were killed, and that he would be going to Hogwarts someday. I mean, it's alot to take in already, the existence of mythological monsters and gods, plus the fact that you are the son of one of those gods, without adding to that the fact that you are suspected of having stolen Zeus's lightning bolt. When you write in the fantasy/myth genre and set it in the real world, you slowly adapt your character to the magical world he will eventually have to save and you pit his doom on him.

The other thing that made it extremely hard to like this book was that there were monsters at every single place Percy's trio stopped by. These were the 'Random' parts of the book. How is it that as soon as Percy and his friends get out of one tight spot they immediately end up in another? Given that they couldn't even stop at a burger joint without being accosted by Ares the god of war, or stop at a random garden ornaments' shop without having Medusa as the shopkeeper, and the nearest hotel just happens to be the one that holds kids prisoner for decades with its promise of an endless supply of food and games, I'm surprised Percy hadn't died earlier on in his childhood, along with half the population in Los Angeles.

Aside from all that, the three main characters Grover, Annabeth, and Percy were actually likeable and memorable - especially Grover, who was my favorite character - but they weren't enough to exucse the fact that they were set in a very badly plotted and disorganized mumbo-jumbo of a story that's fooling itself as an adventure with a mythological twist. There weren't any laugh-out-loud moments for me as, again, the writing style was pretty juvenile. There were some overly used elements, like a school bully, and the jerk stepdad. Generally, it was the book equivalent of a 15-minute animated cartoon. Probably only really good for an audience of 10 year old boys. A big waste of my time."
10,11,1,
11,12,1,"Audiobook, listened to with my two kids.

The reader for the audiobook did a mediocre interpretation. His two accents can be described as sepulchral or yokel. Greatly disliked.

But the media form is separate from the book and has nothing to do with the author or the story he intended. So for the actual story, I was disappointed by the mosaic of Greek myths and characters being puttied together thickly with plot convenience and thin characterizations. The three main protagonists are often characterized as smart, tough, etc. but it takes them for-freaking-ever to cotton on to the many monsters who are trying to kill them. It's like they wander around all ""doodly-doodly, naive demi-god over here, doodly-doodly"" as some sort of Scarlet Pimpernel act. Except it isn't. They are actually always dumb enough to get caught but luckily smart enough to escape.

Ideological issues:

1. The book goes off the premise that Greek myths are actually true, and the Greek deities and monsters actually exist. Fine, I can suspend disbelief. But then the book relegates the last 2,000 years of scientific discovery to humans seeing what they want to see. ""The earth doesn't revolve around the sun, as science has proven and scientists have been silenced for in ancient times. No, it's totally a god and magic.""

2. Faith in the gods is revered, and blind faith makes you a hero.

3. White-washing the myths. Medusa was not Poseidon's girlfriend; Poseidon forced her in the temple of Athena, for which Athena punished...wait for it...Medusa by changing her into a Gorgon.

4. The Camp's name. Half-Blood. Is that a good idea do you think? At least ""muggle"" is a made-up word. Half-blood is a real pejorative term that I think should not be thrown around.

5. All the gods are dead-beat parents. Percy Jackson loves his mom, but she's been just as bad as all the rest. She married a guy for his smell even though he is abusive? Because it protects Percy? What, no.

Victim mentality, only one possible choice, etc. run rampant in this story. And that's a shame because the point of the Perseus story is that you can make your own choices in life, and you can defy fate and the gods."
12,13,1,Bruh.
13,14,1,"I was all set for a fabulous fantasy series, armed with the first 4 of Percy Jackson's adventure books, courtesy of my brother, the fantasy fiend (though I've been one too since my teenage years). I thought the Olympians series would be a cross between Harry Potter and the Amulet of Samarkand. I was gravely disappointed. I admit part of it was the characterisation of my zodiac sign, Aries, as brutish ugly warring types. But fine, I can be all of those things. There were more serious problems with the first book (and no, Maher, I'm not reading the rest).

The obstacles had highly simplistic solutions. Cerebus, the 3 headed dog guarding the gates of Hades, can fobbed off with a rubber ball. Charon, the River Styx boat guard, with money. Etc. Our hero Percy, a demi-god, son of Poseidon and a human, displays no wild Harry Potter intelligence. A certain humour, yes, but nothing even close to Bartimaeus's footnotes. His only motive is finding his (beautiful kind ie perfect) mother. Bo-ring.

He is accompanied on his quest by a dorky buffoon of a satyr and a beautiful wise daughter of Athena. Hello, utterly shameless Harry/Ron/Hermione derivative? And how is a quest this important (preventing war between the three most powerful brothers and gods) entrusted to an untrained half-blood? Oh right, a prophecy. I'm sorry, but that's not good enough.

I kept finding holes in the plot that annoyed me. For eg, when they encounter an eccentric woman, there's this thought Percy has:

""Only later did I wonder how she knew Annabeth's name, even though we had never introduced ourselves.""

Immediately, I thought, oh they're not going to find out who this person is b/c he's STILL wondering later how she knew. Of course, a page later, it's obvious because she's Medusa, Poseidon's ""girlfriend"" and bitter at Athena for breaking them up and turning her into a snake head. They all know perfectly well why she knows. So why, Mr. Riordan, did you write that line? I know you're trying to point out she knows their names mysteriously at first, but it's not so mysterious a second later. Or how about when Ares smuggles something with Percy, and oh so conveniently ""worked some magic"" to make it appear only when it was exactly time. Maybe that's possible in this Olympian world, but then *work* the plot and background information so that the reader understands and believes it when it happens.

I knew by Percy's first early vanquishing of a monster that things were going to go easy for him the whole book, that no supposedly insurmountable problem would foil him for more than a few pages. This was also obvious by his convenient knowledge of all the ancient Greek stories when it's useful for him to know them. This is again something that could have been easily set up in the beginning where he's shown floundering in every school subject. Um, even Latin and Greek. So then how did he learn all that? A genetic disposition?

Anyway, the one good thing is that the plot moves briskly so it's an easy read. On an unrelated note, I hope someone out there writes a series using the Hindu gods and humans and a quest and so on. Then, even if it sucks, at least there'll be brown people and brown customs in it."
14,15,1,"I didn't get very far in this book before I set it down. The premise might have worked out to be interesting, I didn't read enough to know, but the narrative style was extremely annoying. Every page grated on my nerves. I could only endure one chapter.

Also, I felt that the book was very poor at creating dramatic tension. The main character has a confrontation in the first chapter that is told in the most mundane way possible, even though its supposed to be thrilling."
15,16,1,"It's not that I didn't like it. It's that I strongly disliked it. I kept thinking, ""I MUST have the wrong book!"" But I did not. I am utterly confused why any adult would enjoy this book. I thought it was extremely painful. I read to page 123 and I refuse to read another page. Simple, Harry-Potter want-to-be, tries to be humorous but is not, I could have written this book in 4th grade. Do NOT recommend."
16,17,1,"Might write a review about how bad this is at some point. Maybe.

Who knows though. Could happen. Not sure if there is a point though. If you like this kind of book, you're going to read it anyway, regardless. If you don't, maybe you won't.

Tricky."
17,18,1,"this book was BORING!!! this is most definitely made for kids... the writing was bland.. did not even feel nothing for the characters whatsoever!

This middle grade is loved by everybody but sadly it wasnt for me."
18,19,1,"I honestly was very, very interested in the book when I saw it for the first time. “Some dude snatched Zeus’ thunderbolt?” how cool is that? But it also occurred to me that on the day I took this book to the cashier, I felt a strange feeling that I shouldn’t splurge my dough on it. I saw a fat kid, noisily whining and pulling his parents’ hand to the bookstand and tried their best to convince them to buy them one and mum was just shaking her head and said, “No honey, I don’t think you want me to spend $8 for you to reread Harry Potter.” And there she pulled the kid with his both eyes yearningly fixed on the book. I was sure he might cry in any moment. I watched the mum and was amazed how people can be so unbearably ignorant. However I put the book back in the shelf and picked another book then walked wistfully to the cashier. Little did I know, the mum is right and my conscience was sending me the right signal to leave the thing alone.

Every day ever since, every time I heard thunder growling, my thought flying straight to that damn book. This is starting to put on airs, I thought. So one day, lunch hour, I went from my office to the nearest bookstore to get a copy. The errand easily became a quest. It was sold out in every bookstore in the area. It seemed the book had successfully appealed to every kid in town therefore the copies of The Lightning Thief was brutally thieved by a legion of little devil thieves. With empty stomach I went back to office empty handed, wasted (because of ghastly Jakarta traffic), and bloody angry. I was angry good, yeah. Then I heard the growling sound of thunder, like the universe was mocking my calamity of the day. So I went to the toilet and screamed as loud as I could: “I HATE FAT KIDS! I WANT MY LIGHTNING THIEF!” Almost surely the guy who’s shitting generously inside the room in the toilet had no idea what the fuck I was getting at and I heard a loud “plonk” when I was about to leave the toilet.

So I dedicated my Saturday and embark on an against-all-odds quest to find The Lightning Thief. I went literally everywhere in Jakarta, but simply they only have the book two to five without the one. While I was driving, the weather was getting thundery just like a bad omen. Then I gave up. The quest failed, the fat kids won. I hate fat kids ever since.
Just recently, I gathered up with my big, big family (not just my mum and my brother but also with my grandpa and ma and the entire range of my mum’s siblings and their kids which sums up to 20 plus in total) for the New Lunar Year. Then I met some of my cousins (which most of them are fat, yes, but at least they are no kids and I love them). Then it might just my luck when one of them asked, “have you read The Lightning Thief?” It happened that he owns the entire series of Percy Jackson books one to five plus The Demigod Files. I had struck a goldmine. So I went back from my grandma’s house, grinning cheek to cheek with a lump of hoard in my car trunk. Couldn’t restrain myself, I read the book that very night with a high, high expectation. And there I was. Apocalyptically disappointed.
First thing that blows from the book was the fact that one spunky kid hero, one tinker girl and one joker boy is out. I mean, come on—it’s Harry Potter! But then I told myself, no, no this couldn’t be, there must be some twist, it can’t occur that this book is a rip off. But then there it went again, Camp Half Blood equals Hogwarts, Chiron equals Dumbledore and so on. Therefore the more I read the more I saw Harry Potter on the pages whisking his magic wand and spelled, “Wingardium Laviosa!” (Mind my spelling, I’m a mundane).

The second thing was that it was ridiculously, unbearably and insufferably American. Now tell me, what’s with George Washington was an offspring of Athena? What’s with Empire State Building is the goddamn Mount Olympus? What’s with the Olympians’ delusion of America as the centre of Western Civilisation—“…where the flame is the brightest”? And the strangest of all, the bloody Underworld is in L.A? So all of us will eventually cruise down to underground L.A when we’re dead? That would be a fucking tragic death. Maybe—just maybe, this was largely what miraculously makes the series a “New York Times Bestseller” and a “National (America) Bestseller”. Those are three American stuffs humping together.

Then I also noticed Percy was pulling off some Hercules’ stunt when he was a baby: strangle a poisonous snake monster to death. That’s plain Hercules. Will this guy stop rip offing?
And next, I noticed this—IM. Ah! Brilliant! The Gods can Instant Messaging each other! Oh wait, it’s supposed to be Iris Messaging. And how? Get a squirting water gun, squirt some water to sunray, get some rainbows, throw some gold coins into the rainbow and there you go—some talking face appears out of the rainbow. That’s crazy. Not in a good way. I imagined, to maintain the rainbow face talking, I got to keep on spraying and make sure the rainbow is still there—while I’m talking to the rainbow. Shit, that’s got to be my most retarded stunt ever.
I can go on with this forever, but hey, let’s be fair will we? Strangely the book was nicely written, stuffed with wisecracks like, “Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.” Now that was good. It was both slick and sweet (and funny somehow). But there were also some letdowns like, “…my mouth felt like a scorpion had been using it for nest.” (The bloody scorpion just keeps getting in the way). However personally I think there are more goods than bads. Thus this is where the one star came from.

But then, that’s it. No more good things came from this book. I’m not sure whether I want to continue with Sea of Monsters. I was angry (again) when I finished the book—I set a high expectation for it, not to mention the fat kids and all the traffic jam I went through—I’d throw it away to the canal in front of my house if it was mine—but no, it wasn’t. Had it was, it would ended up in the darkest bottom of the waterway, collected by the garbage man, thrown into a recycling centre, and finally turned into a nice, 100% acid-free, cream-coloured recycled paper notebook—which is surely posses a sweet better value than what it once had in its previous life. The notebook would be very proud of itself indeed."
19,20,1,"This review is for the whole series.


Ok, where do I start.
First off, Rick Riordan is a complete AMATEUR. I mean come on, the romance!! Don’t get me started!!!
In every book suddenly, out of nowhere, Annabeth or somebody says something about their feelings. There was nothing to pick up on that any one of the characters has feelings for each other.
In book 4, The Battle of the Labyrinth, out of NOWHERE, Annabeth kisses Percy, and his reaction was pretty much “Oh”. Just such
a-a bland reaction. I mean, the book didn’t talk about what he felt like during the kiss or how he felt about Annabeth!
Same thing with Rachel Dare, when Percy and her were talking he said his “feelings had gotten pretty mixed up the last couple of days”.
His excuse pretty much every time was that he didn’t have time to sort out his feelings!
WHAT?!??! WHAT?!?!!! IF IT’S LOVE, YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME!!!!!
Annabeth and Rachel aren’t the only ones who have so called ‘feelings’, there’s also Calypso in The Battle if the labyrinth.
It’s like, here’s another caring mother figure for Percy, “‘The truth is the gods send me companionship from time to time... They send me a hero I can’t help... just the sort of person I can’t help falling in love with.’
‘Me?’ I asked.
‘If you could see your face.’ She suppressed a smile, though her eyes were still tears. ‘Of course, you’”
Of course you, silly Percy, heh heh, how stupid can you be. But we’re not done yet, here’s Percy’s reaction:
“I can’t.” 😂😂😂
Ok, so apparently the caring mother figure is not a caring mother figure like we thought, but in fact a several thousand years, old woman who has feelings for a teenager.
Go for it Granny.
Calypso must be desperate to fall for Percy, he’s such a goody-goody. I mean, every time he leaves on a quest or something, he’s always like ‘Oh man! I forgot to call my mom! She must be worried sick! I’m such a terrible person to not tell my mom that I’m being chased by monsters and being forced to run! I’m so terrible for not calling her the second I can!’ Blah, blah, blah. We like watching a troublemaker who stumbles into trouble at every turn and makes fun of the situation, but Percy? The guy’s a moron.
Rick, how about you spare us and DON’T EVEN try to write romance.
And it’s not only the romance. His writing style-the way he phrases things is bland, there’s not enough info on the situation, it’s pretty much “‘Hey Percy, can you take out this giant?’ So I take out the giant”
I mean, couldn’t you have explained what it was like taking him out a bit more than you do?!?!! Also the whole idea of celestial bronze weapons vaporizing monsters with a single touch is lame, boring, and honestly stupid!! Celestial bronze is just an excuse for the weak characters to wipe out challenging monsters!!!
Not only that, but, the so called ‘witty’ humor is SO BAD. It makes me SO ANGRY to see this book compared to the amazing Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is AMAZING!!! (I HIGHLY, HIGHLY suggest it).
Also, the goddess Athena, is portrayed as a 12 year-old!! A 12 YEAR-OLD!!?!?!!
You know that old Greek myth about Athena bathing in the forest and a guy stumbles in and googles at Athena bathing? Well that’d be pretty messed if she was 12.
You should’ve thought about that Rick.

And the worst thing about the whole book, listen up here, if nothing else, listen to this, the WORST THING about this book is that Rick writes the book not for action audiences, not for mythology lovers, not even for the fun of writing, Rick writes the books to express his political views. He writes the characters to express his political views. Every character in his book is an environmentalist. They all hate people who tear down trees. Or build anything on an animals habitat. That’s what Rachel Dare’s father is; a businessman who searches for and buys undeveloped land, to build houses and skyscrapers. Also Grover’s whole character’s purpose is too search for the god Pan (the god of the wild and nature) and make Pan fix the world’s pollution! When I read a book I want it to be non-subjective. No politics. I want a book that has fun characters, good romance, out of the ballpark action!
But Rick, you don’t write these books for that purpose. You write these books because you want to tell people that they are wrong for not hugging trees, wrong for living on animals’ land. Maybe the reason why the characters are unoriginal, why the action is boring, why the romance SUCKS, maybe the reason is because you(Rick)didn’t focus on those things, you focused on finding fault with people who don’t share the same views as you. You focused on telling people that their views are wrong if they’re not yours.
So no, I don’t like reading politics in books that are supposed to be fun, because they’re not fun if you spite people who don’t have the same views as you.

On a scale of 0-10, 0 being the worst you can possibly be, 10 being the best you can be (none of the following will get a 10) these are the following features of the book:
Character originality=3
Romance=0
Plot=3
Fun=3
Action=3
Writing=1
Monsters=3

The point I’m trying to make is Rick Riordan is not a brilliant author like every believes him to be, he’s a complete and total AMATEUR. Just because a series or show or movie or whatever is popular does NOT make it good. I mean, sure, the guy’s got an okay imagination, but the writing style, among other things, like the romance and the lack of information and most of all, the politics, makes me want to give this book 0 stars.

If you enjoyed or agreed with this review, please like this review."
20,21,1,"A billion people like this book, including all of my friends who have read it, so I'm sorry if I insult anyone.
Let me put the good things first. Rick Riordan, at his best, is very funny in a random and sarcastic way, and his plot lines are gripping and fast-paced.
Now for the bad part.
Not to sound pretentious and oh-my-look-at-me-I'm-too-good-for-a-gripping-read-ish, but I didn't like the writing style. The sentences were short, the ideas really not challenging, and the reading level about 5th grade.
I could have lived with that, but I'm a mythology purist, and this is less about exploring Greek mythology than killing/defeating/cracking jokes about/modernizing the Greek gods. Sure, the Greek gods, in real life, would probably have updated to GreekGod 2.0 (new! Togas replaced by Hawaiian shirts and jean capris!), but I'm still a purist, and it seems like an insult to Poseidon to stick him in Hawaiian shirts and capris, and to have Ares turned into an annoying muscly motorcyclist.
Also, Athena pledged never to marry or to have children, and that means no demigod kids, either. So why do we have Camp Athena?
The characters are also stereotyped clones of the main Harry Potter trio with all of the interesting levels of the characters that readers can respect gone: Percy, the typical main character, bold, dashing, and Gary Sue; Annabelle, Percy's wisecracking, knowledgeable female counterpart; and Grover, the lovable but faintly silly sidekick.
This doesn't have to do with The Lightning Thief, but with the Percy Jackson series in general: in the excerpt of The Last Olympian that I read, Riptide, Percy's ballpoint pen/sword ( . . . ) is literally described as ""an arc of destruction."" Because of some spell that's been put on Percy, he can randomly massacre the Land of the Dead's gigantic army and kill everything in sight without any of the bullets hitting him, any of the swords chopping his head off, et cetera. Pretty convenient.
I am picky, though. If you're looking for a good read with jokes, this is a good book for you."
21,22,1,"Well, this was a mess.

I can see why these books were popular, but my word, it's definitely written for kids.

The characters are flat, they basically do nothing throughout the book. Everything is accomplished for them, so...why do they exist?

Story's pretty boring; it took me a couple weeks to finish it.

So...I don't plan to read the rest of the books, as there are a lot and I don't have that kind of time.

Plus, as C. S. Lewis once said, ""A children's story which is only enjoyed by children is a bad children's story.""

And I completely agree."
22,23,1,"My apologies to friends who liked this book, but I tried two or three times and have not gotten past page 75. First, I think it is a mistake to use first person narration for a book about a young protagonist. It reads as if it were written by, rather than about, a very young person. Second, it is highly derivative of the Harry Potter book and has -- at best -- only a modicum of imagination or originality."
23,24,1,"im giving this a 1 star for the following reasons:

1. the author is a z!0n!st
2. the audacity to write a middle eastern-muslim character or at least what percy assumed to be one (the character had an alleged middle eastern accent too) only to end up becoming a vile monster, like are we suprised? and then when talking about the way the character is dressed you refer to her headscarf as “a cursed veil” or “reaching up to undo the WRAP around her head” dont you love the terminology and representation towards muslims in this book 😍
3. and ofc george washington was the son of athena like from all the people, you chose one of the most racist men who took the teeth of slaves to make fake teeth for his own
4. the percy jackson movie with logan lerman was way better than this book and u will not change my mind on that"
24,25,1,"I know publishers are desperate to find the next Harry Potter, but this is getting ridiculous. This book is unapologetically the story of an American Harry Potter set in a context of Greek mythology. [SPOILERS AHEAD] A boy with missing parents (well, a mysteriously missing Father) finds that strange magical things are always happening to him but doesn't know why. Turns out he's no muggle (I mean normal human), but is part of a secret world of Greek gods and their offspring, and he has dark enemies who want to destroy him. He is whisked away to a secret magical school (I mean summer camp), where he and all the other newcomers are grouped by house (I mean cabin). He quickly makes enemies with the house of Slitherin (I mean cabin of Aries) but he stands up to them.

I could go on with Potter parallels (at one point I actually started keeping a list), but I won't. I might still have enjoyed this book but unfortunately, unlike Rowling, Riordan seems incapable of building any tension or mystery. He's constantly telegraphing his narrative punches so that you can see every revelation miles before it happens. I got bored and gave up on the book.

On the positive side, at least it's somewhat educational about Greek mythology."
25,26,1,"I took me forever to finish this book. I was hoping for so much more, especially since it seems to be popular with young readers. I felt there was no character development; I knew the characters no better at the end of the book than I did at the beginning. The plot was one predicament after another with weak solutions. It seemed the author was trying to throw as many mythological characters as he could into the story with little reason for them to be there. I thought the premise of the book had real possibilities. When I finished I was just grateful to finally plow through it. I want my books to leave me wanting more. This book really missed that for me. I will not read this author again."
26,27,1,"For once Goodreads recommendations failed me. The idea itself is good, but everything else just fell flat. The characters lacked credibility and persona and the plot was worn-out. I realize I'm probably not the target audience the author had in mind, but I've read my fair share of children's books/books for young readers, and I can immediately think of dozens of alternatives for this one, books that don't underestimate the (young) reader, books with compelling, well-rounded characters and effortless narration (both of which this book unfortunately lacked)."
27,28,1,"I hate to be so harsh to a popular series that may get kids excited about reading, but 1 star is for ""didn't like it"", and that is the case for me. The storytelling is weak, the exploitation of ancient mythology unimaginative, and the writing style is poor. There is so much out there better for young minds, and I'm not going to recommend this for my kids. Write me a note if you want to hear more, otherwise I'll just stop here."
28,29,1,couldn't finish it
29,30,1,"The plot was rushed, characters were weakly developed. I found certain parts mildly problematic. I see why 4th graders enjoy it but it's a pretty crummy book."
30,31,1,"First of all, I didn't like the Idea of a civilization's fate being in the hands of twelve years old boy. That made the whole story look stupid to me.
On the other hand, I kind of hoped that the villains would somehow manage to destroy the the western civilization. It really bothered me that the writer talked about western civilization in a way that it's such a sacred thing.
The plot was loose and stupid. (Protagonists tended to accidentally get into some monster's shop and found the next clue there.)
But it was a nice way to get familiar with Greek mythology. I'm about to start reading Homer's Iliad and the Odyssey.
The only character I liked was Thalia, who appeared briefly in a dream."
31,32,1,DNF at 61% wasn't for me☹️
32,33,1,THE BEST BOOK SERIES IN ALL ETERNITY A MUST READ FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE PLANET
33,34,1,dnf
34,35,1,"I don't see a reason to finish this book, after reading 47% of it. I don't find the story interesting, I don't think the narrative of this book is good and enjoyable; and I don't like any of the characters. Being totally honest, the premiss didn't sound so interesting to me, but I gave it a go because I had the impression that Riordan was this wholesome nice guy, and I got curious. Well, I guess that was not enough as a reason to read this, as he doesn't transmit that in the book at all. There's a tendency in many of the characters to be mean, I guess to make the impression they are cool and witty. Not only that, but I actually find Percy to be quite shallow, as he comments on people's looks often and judge them by that. That thing of calling the Ares kids ""ugly"" and commenting in the (large) size of the shirts that they wear... wh-what?! He gets to the point of mentioning them as ""Ugly Number Two"", ""Ugly Number Three"". So yeh, once again, this is a book where, oh-what-a-coincidence-, the ""mean"" and ""violent"" kids are also not attractive, and are big... aha... ok.

Nothing can save this book for me, really. I'm with the minority that highlights that, even if this is a book for kids, that doesn't mean much at the end of the day. There are so many books written for kids that can be enjoyed at any age, and are beautifully written. There's no excuse for simplifying the narrative as low as this book does."
35,36,1,"I often wonder if I had a time machine what I would use it for. After reading the first Percy Jackson novel I can safely say I would go back and spare myself the time I took reading this book. I know it's intended for a young audience but that doesn't mean it has to be quite so twee. Not only does it seem to be hugely derivative of Harry Potter, just look at the title for starters, but when it comes to Greek mythology, Rick Riordan has taken so much artistic licence the genre is completely misrepresented. OK, so the dyslexia and ADHD elements are on the face of it quite clever but they hardly bear close scrutiny. The character development is poor, and the plot requires the reader to make a number of very big leaps which make it difficult to suspend the necessary disbelief. All I can say is look at the original Greek mythology and you will see this is the biggest farce of the genre since Brad Pitt's performance in Troy. Harry Potter it isn't. As a fan of Greek Mythology I was hugely disappointed. Like Pandora's Jar, I rather wish the lid had not been taken off this particular offering. Not one to recommend and I won't be reading any more of the series."
36,37,1,"As an avid reader and one who looks for real beauty in writing, this book was so disgusting that I will NEVER pick it up again! It was so superficial and packed with blockbuster action garbage that basically screams, ""I deserve to be on the big screen!""
I HATE blockbuster novels like this, because very rarely do they have a real story. With a few films that were novel adaptations that I thoroughly enjoyed, (e.g. Watership Down as a film was fairly faithful to the novel and didn't include lame attempts at humorizing the story.) I knew right away that Riordan wanted it to be adapted for the screen, and that is a good feeling to know something like that.
Plus, when did the danger ever stop? Percy's life was on the line every five seconds!
The entire tone of the book was atrocious. I did not see any actual serious tone in here. It was very hard to take seriously.
The entire novel is a joke! Riordan should really be ashamed of himself for writing something as corny and cliche as this."
37,38,1,"I know there are a lot of people who love this series, but I thought this book was a giant steaming pile. First off, I hated Percy - I thought the author gave little to no attention to developing his character, which in my humble opinion, is a pretty serious miss. Second, I couldn't escape the feeling that this was a Harry Potter rip off - and a poorly written one at that. There are just too many similarities: the child who has special powers (that even he isn't aware of yet), gets shipped off to camp (uh Hogwarts), he happens to have an awkward but loyal red-headed best friend, (and also happens to bleat like a goat while he talks - but that's another rant), the sassy girl who also happens to be part of the trio (Hermione)... I mean, come on.

So needless to say I won't be rushing out to buy the next installments of this series. I love a good YA novel, and I loved Harry Potter, but if you can't bring a unique point of view to the table, don't bring one at all."
38,39,1,
39,40,1,I think that this book is hard to understand if you are really not focused on it. I for me it was hard to understand it because there were some parts that had tricky words. This is a book someone with a high reading level would understand this. Overall this book had some funny parts and some action parts. What i mean by that is that there are funny times in some chapters. But there were some action parts when they were on a journey.To look for Percy Jackson's father. I just feel like I would've spend my time reading something else. There were a lot of questions i had that were answered towards the end of the story.
40,41,1,id buy it physically just to wipe my ass wit the pages
41,42,1,"um. let's just get this over with.

the good
the premise i guess? the whole 'wise girl' thing was cute so i guess i can understand why people love that bit so much. the camp seemed cool when i had seen tiktok edits and content about it? and i guess most of the good characters haven't been introduced yet so hopefully the series gets better? it must, right?


the writing. oh my god. i literally cannot. i don't even know what it was about it, i just found it so hard to focus on. it probably had something to do with the fact that it's intended to read as though a 13 year old with adhd has written it so maybe that's why. or maybe it was the way that almost every second word seemed to be written with a capital letter at the start due to the amount of greek gods and goddesses they were discussing. but dear lord it was hard to read. also it's middle grade so that would also have something to do with it. also literally what was the reason for it to be set in America. when they were explaining why the gods had moved there the only thing going through my mind was that one sound that goes like ""WHAT THE FUCK IS A KILOMETERRRRR *eagle screech*"". like why did it need to be all ""this is America, home of the brave, land of zeus apparently. whatever, i don't care that much. as if that was the biggest problem. i am also still somewhat undecided on the way that this book handled dyslexia and adhd but i think i've decided that i don't like it. i don't have lived experience of either disorder but i do have experience of being neurodivergent and i feel that one of the most annoying things someone can say to you about it is ""don't let it limit you, it's your superpower!!!"" blech. look, i'm sure that that kind of messaging was really affirming for some kids with dyslexia or adhd in making them look at themselves differently but from an older perspective it definitely irked me. i think the most concerning part was the quote did it occur to no one that it might be a bad idea to include a sentence like that in a book targeted at young kids, particularly boys, many of whom may have been on medication? i feel like it prompts an unnecessary distrust in the medical field. for many people, adhd medication is really helpful so i felt like it was weird to claim that it was some sort of placebo designed to keep young people from learning about the world. but that's a whole other can of worms that i shan't open.


trivialising world war 2. what the fuck guys. to claim that world war 2 was basically all the half-blood kids of poseidon and zeus fighting all the half-blood kids of hades was honestly pretty disgusting. and to say that one of the conditions of hades' defeat was that all the gods had to stop having kids with mortals is even more vile. that was an actual historical event with a death toll in the millions and blatant misinformation about it published in a kids book is just not the way to go. and i know, ""it's not that deep"", but i for one think it really is that deep. call me a snowflake leftie and i will wear that badge with pride. you shouldn't be making ridiculous claims, no matter how serious, about the mass genocide of a people. anyway let's get into the racism. as pointed out by numerous articles that pop up when you search ""percy jackson problematic"", there are only 2 explicit characters of colour in this book. and i can't speak for the rest of the series but in this book, they were both introduced in very weird manners and were both monsters. when medusa first appears she is described as being middle eastern, or at least, she must be due to her modest clothing and spoke with an accent. when charon is introduced it is with the (sarcasm for those at the back) descriptor of his ""chocolate-coloured skin"". guys i thought we had moved past using food descriptors for people!! and apparently he ""had a strange accent - British, maybe, but also as if he had learned English as a second language"". wow. thanks. it goes without saying that of course both of these characters are evil. also after doing a very minor search for charon i was horrified to learn that he had been whitewashed for the 2010 film adaptation of the book. come on guys! that's like no-no number 1!

anyway, i wasted literally an entire day on this book. i sure hope the numerous sequels got better because i will never be reading them. i'm not even tagging this review as having any spoilers because i wish i had known all this before i read it."
42,43,1,"Dear Percy Jackson fans, I'm very sorry to say that this will a negative review and I beg of you not to read my reviews of The Last Olympian or The Battle of the Labyrinth because those will only hurt your feelings and that's not what I want to do.

If you can't handle what I say please don't read anything beyond here or my other reviews of this series, I just don't want to ruin a series for someone, and if I have then I'm sorry but my minds made up and I'm not one to change it once its made.

Alright let's get started...

Positive rant-



I just don't like this boy very much, he whines, he's a brat straight up and he constantly...no wait I actually like that part.

Another thing, I the Greek gods, just a bunch of wimpy, duck flipping, moronic, evil, twisted, well understated creatures that obviously have no common sense or respect for each other or anyone else for that matter! I just hate them so much.

Percy was bullied throughout the entire book, not having a sense of direction, the lack of any ambition or interest, in fact he was nothing short of maggot in any level of interest in my books!

I respect the author, I really liked his story, he has a good sense of action and twists in a way, but...no, not for me, I am through with Percy Jackson and the Olympians .

Negative Rant-

ARE YOU CRAZY, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU! STUPID LITTLE...OOOOOH WHERE.IS.MY.WAND! I CANT STAND ANY OF THIS, I HAD TO STEP AWAY FROM THE BOOK FOR A WHILE! MOCKINGJAY WAS LESS DEPRESSING THAN THIS BOOK AND THAT IS DEPREEEESSSSSSSING!

I'm sorry but he never wanted this, and Posiden...I'm very disappointed in him, indeed!



I cant...

I can't believe it's a film series....it's going to copy Harry Potter and The Hunger Games, those are good books compared to this.

A best selling series...


I'm done! But before I leave this for good I want to say to everyone who liked this story, ignore my words if you love it enough to not let it bother you, love it with all of your soul, that all I have to say and good luck


J Vera (C) 11"
43,44,1,"* So I would like to start off by mentioning that irrespective of my personal opinion I don’t think this is an entirely awful piece of literature. Would also like to add that my thoughts are vague as I haven’t read the book in a while, but these criticisms have been sitting with me for at least half a decade now so I think they need to be put out into the world. *

I think the way he utilized Greek mythology and culture was really poor, especially seeing as he has a history related background. I didn’t expect that all mythology would be covered (a LOT of stories to be putting into a series like this) or portrayed in its original complexity but by the same token I did expect that there would be a better presentation of the gods besides what I would like to call an Americanized retelling. I also thought it would’ve been a potentially obvious idea to incorporate modern Greek ideas a bit more to better educate readers on what the actual culture is like today (not to say the book should revolve around it, but wouldn’t it make sense to see Percy alongside a character with a Greek immigrant background given the large influx of Greeks immigrating to America in the later 20th century? Drawing comparisons with modern and Ancient Greek history would’ve been such a creative approach to his narrative, especially given some of the key themes)

This to me doesn’t seem like an anomaly with Riordan’s writing, when reading his other books on Egyptian mythology I found the same, alongside many other annoyed readers at the time. I felt like the idea surrounding the series had so much potential and ultimately fell short of my expectations. I was baffled is to why no one was pointing out the alarming amount of good plot devices left unused here. It's not even necessarily that these are niche ideas, these are common topics in lots of novels of this caliber which discuss culture.

I am aware that the book was written for his kid, and I know the mythology isn’t meant to be the spotlight, but if Tolkien can do it with an imaginary culture, if not several of them, Riordan can afford to do justice to Greek mythology especially considering it’s got nothing to do with his heritage (to my knowledge), and that this is the culture and heritage of millions of people.

I wouldn’t recommend this if you have a love for Greek mythology, and as an obviously peeved history nerd I really, really despise the writing here. Normally I'm able to find the good in something despite its flaws but I'm not even willing to consider that with this series.

Nonetheless, I still congratulate Rick Riordan on writing a piece of work that has left me with an avid hatred for his books almost five years after reading the series."
44,45,1,"""The gods move with the heart of the West. …What you call ‘Western civilization’… is a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it. You might even say they are the source of it, or at least, they are tied so tightly to it that it that they couldn’t possibly fade, not unless all of Western civilization were obliterated. The fire started in Greece. Then, as you well know, the heart of the fire moved to Rome, and so did the gods. … [They] moved to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in England. …And yes, Percy, of course they are now in your United States. … America is now the heart of the flame. It is the great power of the West. And so Olympus is here.""

Very very concerning ideologies are present in this book. I will not finish and I would never give to a child."
45,46,1,"The Gods are so powerful, yet they have to hide, afraid that CNN would make them disclose they don't know what laundry detergent is. Or something.

Percy is Riordan. Percy is a good boy, but that does not seem to be enough. And like Percy, Riordan was a good boy, but that wasn't enough to get anything in the Science classes. Lucky for him, the state always lacks guardians to mind the children during English class. So the bar was low enough to get a diploma. Than, because he is a good boy, he knows all the mandatory lectures, including the Greek Mythology.

I have nothing against Riordan. I find his writing skills superior to Dan Brown. And the fact that he sold a lot of books is proof that there is something. But I prefer writers who work more to polish their stories, like say Gaiman."
46,47,1,This book was recommended to me by a couple different people and the plot seemed intriguing but it was one of the worse books I have ever read. Percy was annoying and unlikeable protagonist. There were times I wished he would have died so I didn't have to read his stupid remarks. The authors attempts to be funny did not work and came across as a middle age man trying to fit in with middle school aged kids. The potential villains were weak and easily defeated. Overall I believe this is a weak attempt to copy Harry Potter.
47,48,1,"Can't help but think of Harry Potter when you read this. It rips off it pretty bad, giving it a mutilated Greek mythology spin. It's a pretty sad imitation. Like comparing a warm, nutritious, delicious, satisfying (for all ages) meal with a hot fudge pop tart. Shoddily put together and leaves you feeling empty with a bellyache.

Definitely not a YA that can entertain beyond it's target audience of sugar hopped kids."
48,49,1,"This book was disappointing. It's not YA like the Mockingjay series or Harry Potter is YA (i.e. totally sophisticated and relatable to any age reader). I found the language to be simplistic, the characters to be one dimensional, the situations to be totally predictable, and I had no emotional connection to anything going on in the book. The whole thing just felt really dumbed down. I wonder what the YA audience actually thought of this book."
49,50,1,"Personally, I don't see why people ENJOYED reading this book. It was only geared towards a specific age of about 11ish to 12ish and since I'm 14 I felt like it was too childish. There are so many better books out there, like The Hunger Games, Nineteen minutes, and Plain Truth. How do you guys think that this is the best book ever? Seriously I don't get it. No offense to anyone out there-I'm not trying to hate on you. I just don't understand what was truly amazing about this book."
50,51,1,"If you find that you are the type of person who has to finish a series once you have started it I admonish you not to read this book. If you do read it read the first one hundred pages and the last fifty pages. Those are the only worthwhile reads in this book. The rest is contrived, mechanical, and trite. Reread Harry Potter if you are that bored!"
51,52,1,"Well, at least I've read as much of this as I ever will. I really wanted to like this book because of how much my students like it, and because of how it's getting kids to read and learn about Greek mythology. But the writing sucks. It is absolutely horrible. I tried, but I could never force myself to get more than half-way. I finally gave up."
52,53,1,I had heard that the book was somewhat different from the movie but the first parts were very similar. Unfortunately I didn't get past the beginning of Percy's training at the camp as Percy irritated me. Too much teenage bitterness does not endear one to a character sadly. I wanted to like this book but I couldn't.
53,54,1,"I didn't actually finish the book, but man did I endure it longer than I should have. I started by reading the paper book, but I was not liking it at all. Then I decided to continue my progress with the audio book, and I really disliked that. The voice that Riordan wrote with was just too immature for me, and the plot wasn't interesting enough."
54,55,1,"I didn't like the story at all. I don't get it.

The only thing I liked in this book was some of the humor. Practically everyone they meet turns out to be a villain (would have been enough to stop at one or two, I think) and I just didn't understand the point of the story."
55,56,1,Uhgg! Every time I try to read or even think about this book I shudder. Such a weak plot...such bad chapter titles...THE CHARACTERS DISCUST ME! All I can say is this book deserved a GOOSE EGG rating! O stars!
56,57,1,"Most over rated, poorly written young adult book i have EVER encountered!!!"
57,58,1,I am very disappointed with this book. I dnf it on page 100 because I couldn't take it anymore. I hope if I read it in the future I will like it more.
58,59,1,I only read this because my cousins are obsessed with it. I did not enjoy. I have never liked this kind of book so idk what I was expecting but I won’t be reading the rest of the series
59,60,1,"Ugh.

I can see how, in some ways, this is an enjoyable enough YA adventure. And in other ways unrelated to classical myth is less so (e.g., characters withhold important information from the hero for no reason at all so often it becomes a joke; the prophesy about betrayal by a friend is fulfilled in the most cop-out way possible), but I want to focus on the use of myth.

First of all, there are the things that just seem like mistakes. A big deal is made of the children of Poseidon and Athena working together, and the risk that, if the gods go to war, those two will be on opposite sides just like in the Trojan War -- except that they were both on the Greek side in the Trojan War. A minor thing, and I have no problem with an author rewriting myths; but that just seems like laziness. And of course, Athena having a daughter at all seems like a problem; Artemis' virginity is mentioned as a reason why there are no children of hers at Camp Half-Blood, but Athena's is just ignored. I know Athena is a popular mythical figure, and once you've stuck yourself with the idea of demigods, you have to find a way around some restrictions, but I would have appreciated at least a little bit of handwaving on this subject. Also, why would Poseidon have a son named Perseus? And so on.

The real problem, though, isn't this sort of nitpicking (how much does it matter, really, how ""accurate"" a book's treatment of Greek myth is?) but the way that Riordan's use of myth flattens it out and throws away a lot of promising opportunities. For example: just after we're introduced to Athena's daughter, we hear about the other gods' children at the camp, and which are the most important: ""If you're a child of Aphrodite or Demeter, you're probably not a real powerful force"" (p. 96).

Ahem. The ancient stories about Aphrodite are constantly making the point that she is the most powerful being around, that even the other gods fear her, that if you scoff at her power something very unpleasant will happen to you, etc. (This is generally about the power of love as an emotion, but Aphrodite also gets understood as a cosmic force, source of life, binding principle of the universe.) One of her canonical (so to speak) half-mortal offspring is a major hero, and through him she's the ancestor of the Romans (Rome is mentioned a couple of times in this book as the place the gods moved from Greece).

Now, I understand that you might want to keep Aphrodite out of your young adult novel, if only to get it past the censors. Fine. But with Demeter, there's no such excuse. Demeter would be perfect for this kind of story. She has canonical affairs with mortals, a canonical child, canonical major conflicts with other gods. And the idea that she's not that powerful is absolutely foreign to ancient accounts. Agriculture was the main source of food for ancient Greece (and, come to think of it, for the modern world), and Demeter is correspondingly important. She's the goddess who almost wipes out humanity when her daughter is missing, until Zeus arranges for Hades to give her back. She's the goddess who, if you cut down the wrong tree, will curse you with a hunger so great that you end up devouring yourself. She has a mystery-cult whose followers get a special status in the underworld. Why on earth would you casually dismiss her from your fantasy world? Well, two reasons: first, a lazy and superficial attitude towards myth, and second, an overriding assumption that men are more interesting than women (and boys than girls, and gods than goddesses).

I want to be clear that this assumption comes from the modern author, not the ancient source material. Given the book's willingness to change things around in Greek myth, there's no excuse for maintaining the status of the three senior male gods as the most powerful - a status which isn't as consistent as you might expect in the ancient material.* The gods we actually meet in the novel are Dionysus, Ares, Hades, Zeus, and Poseidon; no sign of any goddesses. The heroes visit Hades; Persephone is not mentioned. Annabeth, as the daughter of Athena, is occasionally the subject of comments about always having a plan; but in practice, the male hero comes up with the plans every time. The less said about Percy's mother, the better.

I really wanted to like this book. I certainly owe it for bringing a bunch of students to my Classical Myth courses, and they all seem to have enjoyed it. Maybe I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. But I'm not sure I wouldn't rather have no book based in Greek myth at all than one that makes the myths so dull.

Oh, and one other thing. Much is made of Percy being relatively poor, and feeling out of place among his richer classmates. His mom works at a candy shop, his stepdad manages an electronics store. But they live in an apartment on the Upper East Side, and Percy is sent to a series of prestigious private schools (the alternative is mentioned once, when he says he wanted to be at home with his mom ""even if I had to go to public school"" [p.17]). This is never explained, and it drove me crazy.


*The mythical Hera and Demeter both give Zeus serious trouble at times, and gender certainly doesn't seem to affect rank among the gods as much as seniority -- in the Iliad, Hermes knows better than to fight with Leto."
60,61,1,"I know, by posting this review I'll probably get a never-ending backlash from die-hard fans of this series. People who love this book and would sell their soul to Rick Riordan, no hesitation. Those who had a childhood fantasy of going to camp half blood, which they haven't quite let go of.

I had a fear of reading this book for a very long time. No, I wasn't scared that it would give me nightmares or something like that, I was scared that I wouldn't like it. Needless to say, I was right.

I knew that there was a HUGE fandom surrounding this book. Even people who I haven't seen reading a book since 4th grade, seem to have loved this book. That's the thing, I didn't read this book when I was like 8, I'm reading this book the summer going into high school.

The reason why so many people love re-reading books like these is because of nostalgia. I grew up on books like Harry Potter, Land of Stories, School for Good and Evil, a Series of Unfortunate Events, Ella Enchanted, Little House on the Prarie, etc. And the reason why I love these books so much is I get to pretend like I'm 9 again. Sure the stories are good but if I read a book series like Harry Potter now, I probably wouldn't warship it like I did as a 9-year-old. So I respect the fandom a lot but reading a book series like this after coming from books written by people like Cassandra Clair or Holly Black, the series is kinda a letdown.

Lol, I think that may have been the longest intro I've ever written. Anyway, review time :)

Where do I start with this book? The entire thing was an utter disaster.

So there are a LOT of issues with this book, but one of them that I couldn't stand was the fact that Percy never learned ANYTHING!!!
Let me explain.
In a book like HP, we learn only as much as Harry learns when he learns. We only know the spells that Harry knows. Percy Jackson just walks into this world for five seconds and all of a sudden knows everything. So you're telling me that a 12-year-old with no prior experience can all of a sudden beet gods (which have been practicing for 1,000s of years) at duels? As readers, we don't get to see him learn or grow from his mistakes. We don't even get to know how to duel.

As a reader, I had no idea what was going on. No rules for this world were set beforehand. We weren't told what the limits for this world were. We weren't told anything. It was hard to be immersed in the story when this 12-year-old brat knew everything.

Now, a friendly reminder to all authors, :)

Tbh, I didn't care about any of the characters. They were all blander than saltine crackers. No, being the chosen one isn't a personality trait.

This series had so much potential, yet I am very disappointed. Imagine if this book series was YA or even adult. It would be so much fun to read about the gods and their messed-up love lives.

Anyway, I don't plan on continuing this series."
61,62,1,i hate it i hate percy jackson so much this does not interest me at all and i had to listen to it daily for 2 years during school screw u mr pope
62,63,1,"Un-fucking-believable!

Never in my life have I been so glad for a book to end!

I mean, I realize this is supposed to be for children, but jesus kids deserve better than this!

This is lazy, poorly written, misrepresentative garbage.

I can't even begin to say how much I loathed Percy Jackson or just about everyone in this book. I mean, why is everyone in this a total asshole?

On top of that, this is so badly written. Percy's mom dies: he's over it in 2 days-and don't give me that Ambrosia bullshit because you can take it and stuff it! Don't know who Percy's dad is? Then you're dumber than you look. A punch in the stomach if you can't guess who Auntie M is. A push down the stairs if you don't know who's going to betray Percy later in the book. And it goes on like that! Percy's mom is a domestic abuse survivor, well that's just tossed in at the end for whatever reason-sickening!

I keep seeing posts on Reddit where people complain about the lousy movie that was made of this, but (even though I have no intention of further torturing myself by watching what I can only assume will be terrible) I can only figure that they must have made changes that would improve this godawful nightmare.

Also, Hades wasn't evil. The underworld and afterlife and evil didn't take on that until the Christians. Also, I don't think Hades would cheat on Persephone. But the gods in this book come off as spoiled assholes. But I think I've said that, already.

There is an episode of The Simpsons where Homer, Bart and a selected gang of Springfield residents try to pull off a ""tween-lit-gang-write"". It's not a bad episode. That's how this comes off: A semi-literate group of creative writing majors sitting around a table tossing out story ideas left and right and, just like the participation trophies of the days of old, everyone gets to contribute. Even the author name seems made up. I mean if he had some sort of strange background about being hit in the head with a crumpet then I would be totally convinced that he doesn't exist.

The one interesting character, maybe, was Luke, though the narrator (Jesse Bernstein, terrible, just terrible) gives him a stupid surfer accent--in fact, many of the accents he does are just piss-poor. But Luke, I think, would have been a far more interesting character to follow-a guy with a grudge against the gods who wants to tear it all down. That's a hero I'd follow."
63,64,1,"ignore this please i was like 12 😭

The Percy Jackson Series by Rick Riordan is an overrated disaster, I recently had the misfortune of reading the books and it was truly disappointing. The same old plot and dull characters were putting me to sleep. The whole way through I tried to think of some reason to continue; 5 books that I had to force myself to turn the pages to out of boredom.

It's a failed blend of magic, mystery, myth and humour. The endless action scenes and typical ‘main character having endless opportunities handed to him on a silver platter, because of unique ancestry’ got boring after the first chapter.

Needless to say, I was disappointed, recycling the well-written elements of magic from Harry Potter with history did not work. It's like the author expects us to know Greek mythology, as well as they do with no proper introduction to it nor explanation. Half god, half human and half wizard, half muggle, and the use of Half Blood?! Ring any bells; yes, so many, copy and paste, change a few words was what Rick Riordon tried to do, the iconic trio was horribly written and the humour was dry and forced. It seems that the overuse of mortal peril and near-death situations was used to disguise the lack of structure and description.

Somehow the book was adapted into a movie that many fans complained about, so much so that the 3rd movie was cancelled. It was most likely the visual of the books that made them wake up and realize that it was just rubbish. Yet some still blame it on the change of the original plot, of course it was only so bad because the book was too, but hey, ignorance is bliss, or in this case, denial.

Clearly, Percy Jackson was written on little knowledge. The complexity of the plot and basic language were an attempt to bring in a wider audience but I prefer books with originality and new ideas and a directed purpose that either interests or doesn’t. I must say, my favourite part was right at the end, in fact a week after the end when the confusing story had finally left my mind and the tasteless characters were history where they should've been left."
64,65,1,"One night when I had nothing better to do, I watched The Lightning Thief film on TV. It was dreadful. So horrendously dreadful. I thought the books must surely be better. After all, this is a best-selling series, beloved by millions. So I picked up the book and prepared to be amazed.

Let me say that I love children's literature. Winnie-the-Pooh and the Moomintroll series delighted me. I also love fantasy literature. LOTR and were my bread-and-butter growing up. So I was prepared to judge this book as a children's novel aimed at children.

Let me also say that I almost always finish books. once defeated me, and so did Percy Jackson. (Though for entirely different reasons.) I barely made it through Percy's arrival at Hogwarts-- I mean Camp Half-Blood-- and he was about to be Sorted into his House-- I mean cabin, when I put the book down and didn't have the stomach to pick it up again.

The characterization of Percy after his mother's ""death"" was what did it. The boy has one, living family member (that he knows of) and he watches her die. Hours later, he is crushing on a hot chick. I doubt even Don Juan would be crushing on anyone just after . But hey, we all grieve in different ways.

You want to know how a well-written adolescent boy character reacts when he sees a parental figure die before his eyes? Read Harry's reaction to
death in

Other reviewers have said this feels like a Potter knock-off. I did not read far enough to agree or disagree, but this is a juvenile book aimed at juvenile readers, in the fullest sense of the word."
65,66,1,"Well. Hmmm. Part of the problem is the narrator for the audiobook was NOT good. He worked way too hard to do different voices and it was very offputting. Very. But also, this was clunky. And it felt to me like a very obvious attempt to do a Harry Potter sort of thing. I wondered when this book was written and published in relation to Harry Potter book 1 and they were two years apart - Harry Potter coming before this series. There were just so many obvious attempts to ride the train of fame that Harry Potter created for writers.

Percy Jackson is a 12-year-old boy who discovers he is a half-blood, half Greek god and half-human. Upon finding out this surprising news Percy becomes a resident of Half-blood Hill and is sent on a quest to recover Zeus' lightning bolt. Taking along his new friends, Grover and Annabeth, Percy travels from one coast to another to gain access to the Underground where they think the bolt is.

It felt like Riordan was trying way too hard to be relatable and clever with Percy and the other characters. The jokes are all based on mythical creatures and gods and whomever your Greek god was the parent. It was not cheesy, it was just bad. From time to time I could see where my oldest nephew probably chuckled and thought something was clever so for 10 and 11-year-olds this series might be right on target. I felt annoyed at the capers Percy and friends got into and I didn't enjoy the journey at all. I had planned on reading the series because my oldest nephew did and liked it but I can't. I just can't read any more of this series. And I don't think it's because I'm an adult, a Harry Potter fan, or whatever - I think because it's just not very good...in my very humble opinion."
66,67,1,"Quite dissappointed in this one. While I would say it is not horrible, I could not get along with it and had to stop after the first third. Its only my second book ever that I haven't finished reading and the first fantasy. But its too meesy, too flat really. Even as a kid I would have not liked it.

The story is not well developed, there is way too muhc happening all the time, adn there is certainly too much want-to-be-funny! humour in every second or third sentence. There is no depth in anything, neither the descriptions of surroundings, no emotions in the feelings described and everything is put in front of the reader without real space for imagination.

I might try and get back to it another time, but I can't see the appeal in this one.

/

Ziemlich enttäuscht von diesem Buch. Ich würde nicht sagen dass es komplett Grauenhaft ist und sicherlich interessant fuer den ein oder anderen juengeren Leser/in, aber ich konnte absolut nichts mit Percy Jackson anfangen und musste nach dem ersten Drittel aufhören. Es ist erst mein zweites Buch überhaupt, das ich nicht zu Ende gelesen habe, und das erste aus der Kategorie Fantasy. Aber es ist zu kitschig, zu flach . Auch als Kind/Jugendlicher hätte ich es nicht gemocht.

Die Geschichte ist nicht gut entwickelt, es passiert die ganze Zeit viel zu viel, und es gibt sicherlich zu viel Möchtegern-Lustigen Witz der nicht passend und oft nervend ist. Und das in in jedem zweiten oder dritten Satz. Es gibt weder Tiefe oder Klarheit in den Dialogen, noch in den Beschreibungen der Umgebung, keine Emotionen in den beschriebenen Gefühlen und alles wird dem Leser ohne wirklichen Raum für Vorstellungskraft präsentiert.

Die Ursprungsidee ist sicherlich gut, die aussfuehrung Mangelhaft."
67,68,1,
68,69,1,"At first before I read the book I was so into reading a book like this. Greek mythology, action and adventure, and just fiction in general, are some of the things I love in a book. I personally think this was kind of a letdown. I did not like the characters, the greek mythology was almost completely inaccurate, and the story to me was just very bland and undeveloped. There is not much to rate on this book because the feeling I normally feel when reading a new book is not there. I am frankly surprised that I surpassed the first chapter much less read the full book. I will not read any of the other books, this one is good for me."
69,70,1,"A complete knockoff of the Harry Potter series, complete with a misfit hero who has unexplained abilities, goofy male and intelligent female sidekicks, hateful adoptive parent, and an unsuspected nemesis living out in the open. In a reverse of the Potter series, Percy Jackson spends his summer at camp and his school year trying to stay alive. I was disappointed in the quality of the writing and the predictability of the story. However, my 4th grade students (two of them anyway) absolutely LOVE this series, so it has value for someone. Just not me."
70,71,1,"Feels like the author lacked imagination, so he had to write the whole story around Greek mythology, which isn't that interesting to me. My main annoyance was the childishness of this book. I suppose I could've known, but the reviewers here were unanimously positive regardless. The whole story is written from the perspective of a 12 yo American kid. You can see the plot coming a mile away, and the dumb questions will drive you nuts."
71,72,1,"Mr. Riordan should be paying royalties to J.K. Rowling. Poorly written with shallow, hollow characters. The Story line is a pure ripoff of the Harry Potter series. A waste of time. I quit the series part way through book two when it became obvious the author was never going to find his own imagination."
72,73,1,"I have tried and tried and tried with this book, but I just can't do it. I've even tried to read the graphic novel and it just doesn't do anything for me. I just don't care about the characters at all. I love mythology and I thought this would be a great read, but no. However, I couldn't stop listening to the Red Pyramid, it's absolutely fantastic."
73,74,1,"Edit: April 3 2016
The more I think about it, I just really didn't enjoy this book so I am lowering it to a one star


Im sorry to all the Percy Jackson fans, I really wanted to like this. But I couldn't. I would have enjoyed this when I was younger. But I liked the greek mythology aspect which gave it an extra star."
74,75,1,"I think it is a bit overrated. I appreciate the creativity, but the author could not seem to transform this into a well-written book. It is a mediocre book compared to its popularity. I read half-way through and gave up on it. I guess some people like it, but I just didn't see what is so great about it."
75,76,1,I don't do this often but omfg this book is so epically craptastic I just had to let it out. It reads like it was written by a 9 year old who was kept back a few grades. The plot is absolutely bogus. Characters are just a shambles of idiocity and such utter nonsense I can't even BEGIN to describe how bad. So bad. So very bad. I wasted 2hrs of my life on this book. Don't fall into the same trap.
76,77,1,"This book took me WAY to long to finish... And I actually finished it a while ago but... I forgot it was on my reading list, XD. I don't really understand the big thing about Percy Jackson, it was a pretty average book. Maybe I disliked it because I knew what was going to happen (my brother told me before I started reading it.). I don't know, but I did not like it. The end."
77,78,1,"Maybe if I was still a 4th grader I would like this book, but currently, I just find the language annoying. It’s just so…. Well childish. Obviously since the main character is like 12, but I just cannot get through it. I will not repeat the same mistake I did with the wheel of time, so I’ll just leave this."
78,79,1,I was so disappointed in this book!! I expected an easy fun quick read but instead found the most poorly written book I've read in a very long time. It is an insipid version of Harry Potter. And then I saw the movie (on a plane) and that was equally as lame as the book.
79,80,1,"After falling in love with Harry Potter, I couldn't stand these books. My 6-year-old son LOVES them though. They are simplistic, the monsters are larger than life, and the main character always saves the day. Great for kids. Not so great for adults."
80,81,1,"Even with the joy of following along with my son, I just couldn't finish this one. Perhaps it is simply aimed at too young an audience, but I just wasn't enjoying the process of reading it unlike other books such as Hunger Games or the Harry Potter series."
81,82,1,"This book was dreadful. Fair enough if you read it when your 11 or below but if your going to read it above that age, I wouldn't bother. It was extremely childish and I was disappointed after all the hype about these books. I definitely won't be reading anymore in the series."
82,83,1,"I couldn't get into this story. I know people like it and I'm a lover of Greek mythology but this book did not do a good job at making it interesting. I see how grade schoolers could like it, but it was not for me."
83,84,1,"well. i didn't enjoy it. probably i pick it after finishing Harry potter. maybe not. the character's are not that realistic. even plot are boring. so i didn't enjoy it.
nothing is like harry potter after all"
84,85,1,"Okay. People will hate me for this but I don’t care. This series is trash and Percy is like Harry Potter in one of his angry moments. The only part I liked was Vegas, hence the one star. I don’t recommend it"
85,86,1,
86,87,1,i give it a five because is a good book is about gods so we can know what was going on

90,91,1,"Boo! Fake Harry Potter, and not a very good imitation at that."
91,92,1,I cant see the point of reading this instead of Illiad or Odyssee. It is less imaginative and as formulaic.

93,94,1,"I'm just not feeling it. I've always been fascinated by Greek mythology and to see it butchered, mordanized and bastardized beyond belief in Percy Jackson causes me near-physical pain."

102,103,1,"Predecible y aburrido. Los personajes son tontísimos y esos dioses no son griegos. Ni siquiera es fiel a los mitos. Es una norteamericananada de las gordas, con un prota con complejo de salvador blanco y unos acompañantes con menos luces todavía que él. Sobrevaloradísimo."

The first time I read Percy I did not like it very much. I thought the story(and I hate when people does this, but I couldn´t help it) was very similar to Harry Potter. I only read it because this book kept showing up in all forums regarding ""after HP... what?"".

Now, in my mid-tweenties, I thought I should give Percy Jackson a 2nd chance. Why not? The book was on sale.

Unfortunately, I stick to my first opinion. First of all, I could not like Percy. I thought he was very cocky, being only 12-years-old. I know heroes are supposed to be brave, defiant, etc, but in his case, I thought he was arrogant and sassy (hello, Ares is not enemy, he is a God, for God´s sake). And sending Medusa´s head to the Olympic was too much. The Olympic! Where all the Gods live! Where his father is! Just because he was ""angry""... Or when he saw Grover making ""something"" like the sign of the cross, only more ancient... how would he know? Or things that were a mystery, he had a that it was this or that... how would he know? And when he saw Luke´s sword, who could injure mortal or immortals, Percy remembered that ""a hero was never supposed to harm mortals unless it were absolutely necessary"". But when he, Grover and Annabeth had that encounter with that group of bad guys, he did not hesitate to take his own sword out to try to harm them.

Second of all, I did not feel too much chemistry between the 3 friends. Like they were not friends; more like companions in a mission. And it was too much that the only thing that made Grover so ""funny"" was that he was always thinking about food.

Thirtly, the similarity with HP & the Philosopher Stone:

- Grover=Ron; Annabeth=Hermione; Nancy Bobofit=Dudley; Dionysus=Snape; Chiron=Dumbledore; Clarisse=Malfoy.
- After Harry found out he was a wizard, he remembered several episodes in his earlier life involving strange things; the same happened to Percy, only less believable: he defeating a snake (hellooo, we know that happened to Hercules, why the hell did it happen to Percy too? He was not super-strong); he remembering his father (who disappeared when he was what? months-old? How could he remember his father?)
- When he fights the Minotaur, it is pretty much the same when Harry fought the troll.
- When Dionysus says something like ""our new celebrity""... ring a bell, anyone? Snape in his first lesson to Harry.
- Houses in the camp: houses in Hogwarts.
- Food appear magically at lunch
- The revelation of the enemy in the story: Luke, who was a nice guy (Quirrel, who was a nice teacher), tried to kill him because he was being control by Chronos (Quirrel was controlled by Voldemort). Percy tried to stop him, losing consciousness (Harry lost consciousness when he did the same). Percy woke up, finding Chiron next to him, who advised him (Harry wakes up finding Dumbledore next to him, who tells him most of the story). It is the end of terms, and Percy says he is going to come back, because it is like his home... or something like that (Harry tells his friends Hogwarts is his home).

I think is sad, because the idea was great. I am myself a huge fan of Greek/Roman mythology. But the writing was not good (and the translation in Spanish is even worse). In fact, several ""funny"" moments did not even made me smile. I remembered this book the other day when I was watching a movie. You you are supposed to laugh at certain moments but you , cause the joke is too obvious. That is what happened to me with this book."
109,110,1,"Where to start?

There was potential regarding the usage of Greek mythology...but sadly the writing ruined it.

There were numerous times when I wanted to stop reading the book, but decided to carry on, due to the Ancient Greek concepts within the book.

Yes I am going to agree with others saying that this was a Harry Potter rip-off, bearing in mind there have been other books I've read that I've not considered Harry Potter rip-offs, when others have.

1) The black hair and the green eyes.
2) Two friends, a male who is clumsy/not that intelligent/obsessed with food, often makes mistakes.
3) The female friend who is intelligent/more mature than the two boys.
4) The term half blood-possibly a direct rip-off?

We then have the entire universe hiding information from Percy, every time he asks, the person doesn't explain, or doesn't have the time-this happens numerous times, and is almost always something like

""It depends on the Great-""
""What-""
""I can't tell you now-""
""But""

There is so much of the above going on, that the mystery evaporates on the spot.
I know there is something like show but don't tell, but this is 99% don't even show, and forget about telling.

We also have Percy with anger issues, so much so that the puny 12 year old gets angry at a God and is willing to take him on-I mean seriously? The most pathetic things seem to annoy Percy.

The characters are all two dimensional-well what do you expect with Percy dividing his time with getting angry at everything and everybody and feeling sorry for one of his friends, and well er doing stuff maybe??

I wouldn't say that the book is well written either, yes there are aspects of Greek mythology, but they're ruined by Americanisms-well that's what I think anyway,
I mean Camp half-blood shirts-or whatever it's called?
Some gods dressed as surfer dudes, others as killer motorcycle men

Look before people lose their heads over the above statements, I've no issues with American writers or culture, but sorry to me modern American-or any western culture, and Ancient Greek mythology don't mix-yes it's the perfect mixture for everybody else-but it's not for me, and it ruins the book.
There is even a part where it says something like 'translated into American', I mean seriously?
American?
Last time I checked they spoke English in America, not American!

As for Percy's mother ending up with that Gabe-YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!
How could any woman-despite her reasons waste her time with a pig like that?
Yes it's explained why, but it's still disgusting and revolting.
You might as well have a supermodel dating a guy who showers once every 2 years, and is riddled with every single infectious disease, and who sleeps and lives in his own waste, and then shares the bed with her-disgusting beyond belief!

I'm now wondering if book two would be any better."
110,111,1,"Note: You've seen the low rating. This review isn't going to be nice. If your inner child who enjoyed these books will be offended, I'd rather you skip this review entirely.

I sincerely hope that all the adults who recommended I read this haven't actually picked up this book in the last five years, because it's got some serious problems.

I don't know why I even bothered to pick this series up again - that's a lie; it's for my future class reading list- the book is still bloody awful compared to most modern fantasy. I literally lost interest halfway, because Riordan just keeps throwing things at the wall in hopes they will stick without adding anything of value to the overarching story.

It would have helped if Riordan had gone with anything but the absolute flattest interpretation of the Greek gods and their roles and personalities. When he ventured into orphic territory by mentioning the death of pan, I had hopes for a minute but those were dashed by all the rest. (Aphrodite and Dionysus were both done incredibly dirty.)

Honestly, those were the least of my worries.

Here's the elements that got me legitimately angry:

1. The constant rhetoric about the greatness and importance of western civilization, completely erasing non-western cultures in the process.

2. The constant fatphobia and connection between heavier body types and villainy. (Nancy, Clarissa, Echidna, Gabe, Ares, should I go on?)

3. A narrative about pagan gods being completely overruled by the christian notion of death equals evil. So many conversations about alternative views on the transient nature of life and death could have been had. (You know, conversations that are a real focal point in pagan belief systems, old and new.)

4. WW2 being reduced to a fantasy trope by painting it as nothing more than a spat between helfbloods + implying that Hitler was a child of Hades. WW2 and the holocaust were deeply traumatic events that deserve a more serious approach than ""the gods don't get along so they ask their children to fight"". It pretty harmful to reduce one of humanity's darkest moments to fight between nameless fantastical figures.

5. The inherent misogyny of praising a woman for letting herself be abused to ""protect her child"".

6. Painting Medusa as Poseidon's ""girlfriend"" is sexist as hell and greatly takes away from either the horror or the empowerment of the original myth (depending on which version you go with).

That's it. If you still want to read this afterwards, I won't stop you, but at least dare to take off those rose-coloured nostalgia glasses."
111,112,1,"Quite an old book that I read because I was looking for a ya novel that was written in first pov and past tense. most of them now were written in present tense and I had to get back eight years to find one reference that fitted.

POV and tense choice aside, the idea was good, but the main character kept getting on my nerve. The more I read, the more I couldn't stand him.

I mean... what was this kid problem?

He was dyslexia, ADHD, and bla-bla-bla -- okay, he was troubled kid -- but there were much more kids who were born with worse condition and most of them didn't get kick out from school six times in six years and then bitched around blaming it in their condition. no, they didn't let the condition took control over their life -- they overcame it.

And when Annabeth said to him:


Yeah, I agreed with her, Percy wasn't smart and it got nothing to do with his grade at school.

First of all, the moment he realized that gods existed in his universe, he should've learned to watch his attitude towards them -- especially when the said-gods weren't the most magnanimous and forgiving lots.

But this kid, even after he got into the half-blood camp, he insisted that he didn't believe in gods. okay, it was his decision entirely, but the proof had been there.

so I was like, ""okay, you didn't believe, but weren't you seeing?""

one of the gods even played game in front of him! did he wait for them to dance naked around him to see that they were real ?

Second, this twelve y.o. kid lived like he had nothing to lose.

the gods were real, they were powerful, and normal people would work the logic not to go around badmouthing them, let alone calling them 'jerk' right on their face.

but Percy, no, he had to always show attitude towards them like he didn't even care of the consequence that might come -- or maybe he just didn't really think.

If I were Zeus, I would strike him with my lightning to teach this disrespectful twelve y.o. kid some manner. if the gods were as proud as they were written in the myth, Percy should've been dead the moment he opened his mouth.



He wasn't impertinent -- he was downright stupid. (excuse my word)

Overall, the Greek mythology mix in the story was good, and for that alone, this book was a two stars for me, but I really really really didn't like Percy, so 1.5 star IMHO."
112,113,1,"I can honestly say that this was one of the worst books I have ever read. However, I like to start off my reviews on a rather more positive note, so before I start slagging this book off, I will praise the author for the (albeit few) aspects that I liked:

1) The first chapter was gripping and I felt compelled to read more. It was very mysterious, and set my hopes a little higher for the book.

2) Disabilities were portrayed in a positive light, and this is something that I have rarely seen done before in literature.

3) The idea of Greek mythology is great, and I would like to learn more about it.

Sorry, but that's it. I was just repelled by the utterly abysmal writing. I am 17 years old, so I can safely say that this book is intended for a younger audience than myself, however, there are children's books out there which are an enjoyable read for an adult/older teenager. This was not one of them.

The writing completely lacked any sort of description or beauty. It was far too simplistic and I just felt that everything was dumbed down and made to feel like a spoof: a painfully unfunny spoof. The jokes were awful and juvenile. I couldn't take any of the characters seriously, largely because the book was incredibly awkward in that it didn't know whether it was a comedy or a serious fantasy novel. I just felt that Greek mythology, which is beautiful and elegant in so many ways, had been destroyed in this novel. I did not fear any of the characters, nor did I admire any of them.

Don't even get me started on how this book is a complete rip-off of the Harry Potter series by J.K Rowling! I know, lots of people are saying this but it's true. The characters, such as Percy, Annabeth and Grover are practically carbon copies of Harry, Hermione and Ron, except not nearly as well-developed or deep. Certain aspects of the plot were parallel to those of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. For example, a behemoth multiple-headed dog is guarding something and the children need to distract it to get past. The main character wakes up at the end of the novel in a bed, with Chiron (or Dumbledore) watching over them. Need I say any more?

My advice would be: just don't bother with this one. You'd be better off (re)reading Harry Potter, as it's better written and infinitely more enjoyable to read."
113,114,1,I just didn't like it at all...a waste of my time...the idea was good though just the execution that didn't go all that great...and don't even start about the cover...
114,115,1,"Изумително е в какви измерения се преражда лудостта на тинейджърите, но общо взето тя винаги витае около едно – фантастиката. Първо бяха вампирите на Майър, сега полубогове. Най-хубавото в тая книга е, че ще научи всеки на малко митология.

Има неща, които нищо не може да спре, едно от тях е фантазията. В тази книга всичко е изградено върху нея, не знам защо, но ми напомня за „Дракула”, нещо истинско обвито във фантазия. Цяла митология от богове натъпкани тук и обвързани от нещо. Лично аз съм фен на Хадес, въпреки всички лоши неща по негов адрес.

Първо гледах филма, който излезе наскоро, а чак сега чета книгата. Има общо, не мога да отрека, има много общи неща, но както винаги и много неща се разминават. Чудното обаче е, че ми е трудно да кажа кое е по-добро, филмът или книгата. Филмите винаги са по-емоционални, а книгите по-реални и тук е така.

Не успя да ме изуми или да ме вкара във възторг, може би заради начина, по който бях настроена към нея. Има толкова неща, в които се опитват да ни накарат да повярваме, само защото сме хора. И сякаш никога не е достатъчно, не е достатъчно да сме вампири и да сеем смърт, по-късно трябва да сме Богове, за да поправяме света, а преди това трябваше да сме магьосници и винаги да ни гони злото, но поне в последното има истина. Винаги ни гони злото, независимо дали в един човешки живот или някакъв по-висш.

За разбирането, че това е следващата тинейджърска страст съм съгласна, главният герой е на 13. Но мен просто не успя да ме трогне, за това не вземайте мнението ми насериозно, аз не бях трогната и от лудницата „Здрач”, но има нещо, което винаги ще признавам като най-добрата тинейджърска фантастика, както и милиони хора с мен по света и това е „Хари Потър”. Класиката е завинаги и за съжаление тя не може да бъде заменена от Посейдон, Зевс или пък Хадес.

Книгата е увлекателна все пак, чете се бързо и много ми хареса формата под който е. Самите й размери. Не е в нормалните размери и на мен ми беше много удобна за четене, най-вече в час по английски. Ще видим как ще бъде с останалите книги от поредицата."
115,116,1,"I love children's literature! Sometimes I'm at my happiest when I'm reading a children's book. But Percy Jackson represents most of the things that children's literature does wrong such as the constant employment of over-simplified, colloquial language (ex. ""My shield was the size of a professional basketball backboard. It must have weighed a million pounds!""). I understand that children don't have the vocabulary that teenagers or adults have but books can still have the musical rhythm and occasional difficult word that blends prose and poetry. Read Kathryn Lasky's ""Wolves of the Beyond"" series and you'll notice the astounding elevation in literary quality even thought it is a popular work of fiction!
Rick Riordan's first Percy Jackson novel is a novel that pretends to be creative by using ancient Greek mythology to appeal to a wider audience. There is nothing original going on here because the process for Riordan was clearly formulaic: Use Greek mythology in the context of a pre-teen, half-God. He doesn't bend or twist the rules. Every single event which occurs in Greek myth is taken literally in Percy's universe. The prose is dry but the lesser of three evils when you consider internal and social dialogue. Riordan's inability to incorporate any level of emotion in a failed attempt at tragedy is laughable. Quite frankly, this novel is a poor-excuse for one that fails on almost every level. I would recommend this book to younger children just to pique their interest in Greek mythology in a way that's more relatable.

To end on a brighter note, here's some of my favourite children's lit books: Silverwing, Firewing (Kenneth Oppel); Charlotte's Web (White); The Once and Future King (T.H. White); Guardians of Ga'hoole series and Wolves of the Beyond series (Kathryn Lasky); Goosebumps (R.L. Stine)."
116,117,1,"I am not the demographic for this book. I am not a young boy between roughly 9 and 13. I know this and tried to keep that in mind as I read, and yet I still had a hard time stomaching the ridiculousness of the plot and dialogue. It was juvenile to a fault. I mean defeating the
giant hellhound of Hades, Cerberus, with a friendly game of fetch because his master doesn't give him enough playtime is not my idea for a good fantasy story.


What I also didn't much care for was the internal narrative of our protagonist, Percy Jackson. I completely concede my distaste is derived from being 20+ years removed from teenage angst. Still, Percy's thoughts were annoying and I was counting down the pages till I could check this off my list.


Which brings me to probably my biggest compliant: this came from my list. Kids are having trouble readying or something? Have we now lowered our standards so much as to ""require"" kids to read this dribble?! If the list is accurate, I am both disappointed in our education system and saddened for our kids. Woah...perhaps Percy's melodrama is rubbing off on me.


did get me to think about ONE thing. Much to my surprise, the Harry Potter series has had a fair amount of criticism and negative reviews. Even knowing that, I've been taken aback by actually talking with people who were with the books. My own wife (if I had only known) couldn't even finish because it couldn't hold her interest. And she's a middle school teacher! Perhaps I can understand that concept a bit more now. I mean, Harry Potter critics are still crazy....but I have to admit that I can appreciate their viewpoint more today than I did I yesterday. Thank you for that, Mr. Riordan."
117,118,1,"I can't keep reading this. I realized I was reading a chapter here and there just to finish it rather than because I enjoyed it. I can see myself loving this at a much younger age but, alas, the years have changed me much.
My biggest problem with it is the overuse of the same methods to drive the plot. For example, check out the following scene between Percy and Grover.










My problem with this scene is that it happens SO MUCH. A character sharing, and then realizing that they've shared too much, and then deciding to stop sharing, and then we're left to think ""uh huh! something is going on here"" is an incredibly overused plot driver in this book.

Also, I'm a big fan of books that do a good job of tricking me and making me believe one way. I actually think I'm a pretty good audience for these types of books and movies (a la Fight Club, Beautiful Mind, etc. I'm the last person to FIGURE IT OUT). However, this book had too many doh moments that I figured out way before Percy did. ""Oh I get it, this is Medusa because of snakes and frozen statues and...oh wow doh how clever.""

I read this to connect better with my students but, 200 pages in, I really can't get myself to finish it :/"
118,119,1,"i only read half of the book! now hear me out. i should have maybe of given this book abit more of a chance but i dont know what it was i just really didnt enjoy the book. it maybe the way i was reading the book but to me what was going on i just didnt quite understand what on earth was happening most the time.

the way things were explained i just really didnt enjoy the book at all. and i know this is a very popular series but i tried reading this book rwice and i just had to put it down in the end i just sold the books.

i really hope that this doesnt put you off trying to read this series just becasue i didnt enjoy it. however i did actully enjoy the films now im not one to the ever watch the films before the series but this time i did and i glad i did beacsue i may not of ever have watched the films at all."
119,120,1,they lied to me
120,121,1,"I guess I'm in the minority, because this just wasn't for me. I'd give it 1 star, but.. eh. This isn't meant to spark any hate for all the people who love this book and series, it's just my opinion.

I had an extremely hard time getting through this book. I didn't enjoy it at all. I listened to it in something like 10 sittings and stopped at about 90% when I couldn't take it anymore and wasn't able to finish it.

Because of all the hype that this book series gets, I was expecting it to be a book that can be read at any age. Like Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, or a newer release - The Glass Sentence. Or any one of the many Middle Grade books that are amazing and fascinating at 8, 12, 18, 25, 50, 60 etc. (Not all are, of course, but there are a ton!)

For me, this was just not the case.
Not only did it read like it's suited only for young readers, but I thought it was just too cheesy. I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1, because I'm sure that many people like it with all the cheesiness and if I was 12 when I read it, I might have given it 3 stars. So I'll compromise.

The imagination of the author is.. well, very imaginative. So many things happen and there are a lot of details and I guess it was written well. Though I wasn't even able to pay attention to the writing style, because of all the cheesy dialogue and the weird things happening. Great for a younger reader, but not something that appealed to me now. Maybe if I had read it as a child and this was a reread, maybe I'd think differently. I don't know.. But somehow I don't think I'd have enjoyed it as a child either."
121,122,1,"This book series is a constant point of contention for me.

when I was in 1st grade as part of an ""advanced reading"" class I was instructed to read this book. I didn't. in my first reading of the book I probably got about 10 pages in before throwing up my hands and saying, ""I hate this!""

In third grade when all my friends were reading the series I tried again. this time I forced myself to finish the book before throwing up my hands and saying, ""I hate this!""

In 6th grade, part of the series was required reading for a grade. I was so determined to hate it and was completely shocked that I didn't. the book that we were reading was void of any plot really but was more about the backstory of the gods and goddesses which I found very interesting. so because of this, I gave this book another chance. but no. I still threw my hands up and exclaimed, ""I hate it!""

Then a week ago I saw the dreaded book on my bookshelf and thought what the heck. so I sat down finished it and threw it away. this book had no real original plot. it was one cliche following another. the narrator's voice wasn't unique at all and the integration of the Greek gods just seemed cheap. the idea of making the gods more in today's society and ""funny"" wasn't nessasarly a bad one. the way it was executed however wasn't good. Personally, I believe that this book should only be read by elementary leave readers who have been exposed to the main cliches of fantasy novels. the word-choice is able to be read by elementary students and frankly, that's where this book should stay. in the depths of some in-class school library to be read by children then forgotten about."
122,123,1,I STRONGLY disliked this book. The writing was poop and it felt sexist.
123,124,1,"Может, популярность этой книги не сбавляет обороты и поныне потому, что люди познакомились с ней в соответствующем возрасте, и теперь их интерес держится на ностальгии? Понимаю, каждому своё, но мне невдомёк почему «Перси Джексон» все ещё так обожаем, и любые новости по нему (привет предстоящему сериалу от Disney+) вызывают БУМ в сети. Наверное, я действительно недооцениваю греческую мифологию и её влияние на культуру потребления.

В рецензиях обычно отмечают хороший юмор и неплохое раскрытие уже упомянутой мифологииЯ ни того ни другого здесь для себя не увидела

Персонажи посредственные. Взять в сравнение «Гарри Поттера»: первая книга в серии также максимально детская, но написана она интересно, увлекает, хотя и представляет все тех же Избранного, Заучку и Неудачника; Роулинг делает это с изюминкой, поэтому и любопытно. «Перси Джексон» ощущается как дешёвая замена книгам Роулинг со всей этой клоунадой с Богами.

О, и у книги ужасная экранизация. Признаю, на фоне фильма писанина Риордана выигрышнее. Автор книг хоть обладает умом, дабы пояснить за любой логический вопрос, который может возникнуть у читателя, а вот фильм не только не хочет объяснять , но и более того – меняет некоторые сюжетные линии, делая историю ещё глупее. Прям детский садик ясельная группа с 0% логики, и пачкой пафоса от подростков а-ля"
124,125,1,"I fail to see why this series is so popular with kids; I found it boring and filling with stereotypical characters. The main plot line is that Percy Jackson, a sixth grader with ADHD and dyslexia, discovers that he is the son of Poseidon and a human mother. He undertakes a quest with his friends, Grover, a satyr and Annabeth, the half human daughter of Athena to return Zeus's lightning bolt.

There are similarities to the Harry Potter series--discovering magical talents, a school (here a summer camp for ""half bloods""), adventures with a male and female friend, an unhappy home life in the real world. However these elements are not handled as well as in Rowling's fictional world. Percy is never a very likeable character and the abusive stepdad is a garish cliche.

Much of the plot and action is based around the actions of the gods and Percy fights demons from mythology on his quest. Many middle grade readers love mythology so this is probably a big appeal factor. I found the action to be dull and many of the explanations for why things were happening defaulted to it is this way because these gods have always hated each other.

I listened to this book on audio and found the reader to be very sub-par. He handled the younger charcters adequately but the voices that he created for the powerful gods were robotic and without nuance. This probably added to my negative impression of the book."
125,126,1,
126,127,1,"To all reluctant readers: you're absolutely right; don't pick it up.

One star for borderline horrible. The idea of the story was good and it had lots of potential, but that was an opportunity wasted. I was intrigued by it after seeing how much hype it generated. However, when I read it, I was sorely disappointed.
The writing style was very bad, riddled with unfunny jokes. The humor was very primitive; it was the kind of humor only children would laugh at. Interactions between characters aren't realistic, with Percy's (the main character) rivals one-dimensional.
Did I mention Percy is one of the biggest Gary Stues I've ever read about? He's overpowered, popular, and constantly admired.
I was genuinely mystified as to why it was so popular, but I came to the conclusion that not many other books of this type exist, and the ones that do aren't as ""humorous"" to readers as this.
A rip-off of Harry Potter, with so many plot parallels I could write a list.
I read it when I was nine, and taking a look at it now, I have absolutely no idea how I could tolerate reading it. The book is praised for not being shallow, graphic and sexual like YA books; but I can assure you that most YA books are better-written than this, and a lot of them don't contain mature content. I recommend that you don't waste your time on Percy Jackson and the Olympians if you're over ten-years-old.

~Joumana"
127,128,1,"Totally disliked it. To me one of the worst books I've ever read. Probably a poor Harry Potter's copy although it's worse than the amazing serie (HP).
I thought the book had a bad-writing: the scenes were not detailed and the action happened so fast that you couldn't enjoy it. BAD!

It's impossible not to compare this book to Harry Potter, there are so many things that are the same! I won't tell what things are because everybook has already told them.

The main character was ok, his friend animal was fine too and the girl was nothing. I hate when authors make one main character do everything he want and the secondary characters seem to be nothing! They can't do amazing things like the main one, to me it's ridiculous, totally! There's no reason for such a thing! Percy Jackson can walk upon water, fly, got a nice pen-sword and his father is the greatest father a child could have! ¬¬º While the others characters are stupid and weak.

The last thing: I hated it. I payed a LOT of money on it and I wish I could go back in time to undo what I did. ""/

I know we are not talking about the movie but there's no way to say about it. I thought it was, amazingly, worse than the book. In the movie his animal friend is dirty, love chicks and only want to know about girls! Come on! It's a kids' movie, not a porn!

I really hated and I would give it -10 if I could."
128,129,1,"A Huge Step Forward in super-ugly neorealism.

I really wanted to like Percy Jackson. The premise of a half-god living today seemed like it had some promise. The idea may have smelled slightly of Harry Potter, but nonetheless it was hard to discount it completely, especially when I found the entire series for $20.

However, where the book's premise held some promise (and to some extent delivered), it instead proved to be the perfect example of what it looks like when adult authors try to be cool for teenage literature. Comparisons to Harry Potter aside, Rowling's novels work because (while somewhat goofy) the books remain magical without crossing the line to ridiculous. Riordan shows none of this writing ability and is instead left with a mess of gods riding motorcycles and wearing Italian suits, if for no other reason than to make it appear ""cool"". Percy Jackson is not just a half god, but one with a 'cool' attitude. Likewise, Riordan is an author who attempts to be cool by inserting extreme sports and ridiculous circumstances. In the end, the novel ends with a few interesting strands tied together by dumbed down situations and characters who become nothing more than parities of what it means to be extreme.

Shame on you Rick Riordan - you have done a disservice to literature and have simultaneously insulted the intelligence of the reader."
129,130,1,"The main storyline reads just like the ancient Greek stories do. So you know what to expect: affiars, violence etc.


Summary:
Percy Jackson, the hero of the story, adores his supposedly-wonderful mother. She has had an affair with Percy's father (who is a greek god). She still loves him but purposefully marries a ""slob"", using him as a cover for her son (children of greek gods are always in danger). Percy rationalizes why it is wrong for him to kill this bum, but leaves the means to do so in his dear mother's hands. She does the dirty deed herself. This is presented in the story as clever and funny. Our hero still adores his mother.

Review:
Even if you look past the causal mentioning of abuse (from the ""slob"" step father and other Greek god parents), the affairs and the like you still have to deal with violence (which is actually fairly graphic at times for a juvenile book) you still have inconsistencies in the storyline. And inconsistences in plot and story drive me crazy to no end because in a secular world we cannot expect authors there always to be positive concept in books but we should be expecting the author to come up with a story that is consistent.

As if that wasn't enough problems for one book, there are also holes in the story not to mention that I found all the characters to be very un-original and boring."
130,131,1,"Reading the lightning thief -- book one of the Percy Jackson pentalogy -- was like looking over my math test, that is, it's brimming with flaws each step of the way. To start, Percy Jackson, our twelve year old narrator that is suffering from ADHD, dyslexia, and a missing father, is just another cliche kid that gets powers and saves the world. The unoriginality of the story is simply appalling since there's already collections of movies and books, such as Harry Potter, that's structured around a wimpy kid getting powers and saving the world. Then there was the disastrous storyline. As someone that has held a deep fascination about worldly religions and beliefs, I beseeched that if nothing else, the plot would be entertaining; it wasn’t. Battling monster after monster after monster, I often wonder if this book is actually progressing in its storyline or if Riordan is simply lengthening the story for the sole purpose of pointlessly introducing gods and monsters. Whats worse is how Percy Jackson, this twelve year old kid from middle school who just recently found out about his powers, seemly dominates the very gods from which his power originated. However I need to thank the book because now I’m finally able to comprehend what my father means when he says,” I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed”."
131,132,1,"I hated this book. Hated. The story was fast-paced but lacked any ounce of sincerity. Yes, I will compare this to Harry Potter because they are written for the same age group. Where HP brought depth Percy felt completely flat in all regards. I felt no sincere tension, didn't worry for the main character or side characters one moment. The only ""depth"" is in the relationship between Percy and his mom but the way that worked out, the explanation took any true pain or feelings away. I am a history buff, I love history but the references in this book are warped to fit the story telling style so any pleasure at all was taken away for me. It's all run of the mill adventure, maybe an 8 year old boy would truly enjoy this but I'm rather sure that even if I was that age it still would have felt flat, inflated to the point of deflation. That's the struggle with American story telling and even Coca Cola isn't as American as this book is. It's formulaic, predictable and leans on cultural standards that have never appealed to me. In the time it took me to read this piece of burning garbage I'd preferred to watch something really bad like Jersey Shore. Yes, I said it, that show pleased me more then this book did. Even the spin-offs of that show pleased me more then this book did. Rick Riordan, never again."
132,133,1,"not a fan of this author‼️ 3 stars‼️

the writing was meh. like I get it percy and the gang are twelve years old but it was just TOO boring reading abt his thoughts. the word ugly came up too many times and by the eight hundredth and sixty seventh time I saw the word, I had a mental breakdown and could not keep going. wish I read this ten years ago because eighteen year old me did not have a slay time.

it was weird reading it cause I have seen the movie and it was way better. I love logan lerman<3 but i must admit it was interesting to see how the story was actually written and to see the what had changed in the movie compared to the book. you see much more depth and personality in the characters in here and I feel like after reading this, the movie was definitely rushed so I can’t wait for the series!!
percy definitely handled everything well considering everything he goes through. it’s for sure traumatic but he kinda just thrived through it. slay??? okay anabeth and percy they way the blush over literally anything the other one does I’m cryinggg.

anyways, I guess it was good. adventurous and such an interesting storyline. anabeth and grover are the only characters I like. percy I’ll consider you when you stop using the word ugly, jerk and punk in every sentence. it’s too cringe I can’t cope with it. everyone else is literally so annoying like pls stop."

134,135,1,"There is young adult fiction that tweens and elementary students enjoy and then there is young adult fiction that anyone can enjoy. This is not the second type.

It's impossible not to compare this book to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, since Harry Potter was the last YA fiction series to take the literary world by storm. And, unfortunately, there's no comparison.

Whereas J.K. Rowling created a magnificent, multi-dimensional universe, delightful characters, and intriguing plots...Riordan did not. The book is plot-driven (rather than character-driven) and reads like a cheesy screenplay; and so you finish the book not liking or caring about Percy Jackson--who is unidimensional, unemotional, and kind of stupid.


About the only credit I give Riordan is that he'll maybe get kids interested in Greek mythology and that he sold his story to Hollywood, so he's rich."
135,136,1,"I don't normally rate books based on my opinion of the author. But THIS?

""Personally, I don’t see any harm in learning mythology as long as we recognize the myths as stories that are part of our heritage and long-since stopped being any kind of serious religion.""

""I didn’t realize some people still worship the old Viking gods. Very strange, and a little scary... In my opinion, the more you learn about the mythology, the more impossible it is to take it seriously as a religion... after you’ve met Odin and Thor in the stories, who in their right mind would ever want to worship them?""

Listen, I'm a pagan and I honestly don't care what people think about my religion. I get all kinds of shit for it. Christians call me a devil worshiper, atheists call me delusional... I've heard it all, really.

But never, NEVER have I seen someone with the fucking audacity to throw two entire religions (Asatru and Hellenismos--Google it) under the bus WHILE FINANCIALLY BENEFITING FROM THOSE RELIGIONS. If you're writing a wildly popular series about the Norse, Roman, Egyptian, and Greek gods, I expect you to at least respect those gods who are effectively earning you millions of dollars.

So way to go Rick, you've set a new standard for douchebaggery. *slowclap*"
136,137,1,"""Pubescence At Its Most Juvenile""

There are books written for the young'uns that are written so well that anyone can enjoy them, all across the age board (Harry Potter). The Percy Jackson series isn't one of them. Reaching the last page, I cried baby-like (with kickings and blubberings) at the loss of those couple of hours I'll never be able to get back...

Written with a character in mind who seems to be from the less intelligent side of the 12-year-old demographic, I felt that the psychological and social complexities of being a kid at that age were dumbed down for, I don't know, 12-year-old rutabagas?

My personal opinion is that stories are compelling because the people they are about are interesting and have a unique story to tell. It's why the people we read about will usually start out as peasants from the Middle-of-Nowhere and go on to become the long-lost prophesied progeny of an All-Magnificent God of Magnificence. Or something therelike. wasn't horrible, it just wasn't very intelligent, funny, or original. Unless you're twelve? *shrugs*"
137,138,1,"A fun, little adventure story BUT JESUS CHRIST. The AUDACITY to call Medusa Poseidon's girlfriend? Sweets, he raped her. Also, Mr Brunner or whatever his pseudonym was (Chiron) is a Latin teacher but the exam is full of questions concerning mythology? And just teaches about mythology? Sure, sometimes in Latin class we read texts that deal with mythology but.. that's... whatever. ALSO, Athena, the VIRGIN goddess of war, has children? Excuse me? So Artemis doesn't have children because she's one of the THREE virgin goddesses (Athena, Artemis and Hestia), but Athena has MULTIPLE children? Did she forget her vows or something? No, sorry, NEXT. And why do they (the satyrs and gods and whoever else) use both Ancient Greek and Latin? Is this story about Greek gods or not? Also, what the fuck was that weird casino/hotel thing about? Still confused about that. The story itself is fine and I know that this is not a retelling of myths but really? SOME accuracy, please. And I'm not even going to get into the fact that the gods apparently use cameras and TVs and whatnot and that Mount Olympus is accessed by an elevator..."
138,139,1,"Ok, the fact that it took me over a month and a half to read this book should tell you something about how little I cared about it or the characters or the plot. It was a poor attempt to imitate ""Harry Potter"" from characters to plot to situations. The plot jumped around from adventure to adventure too quickly. The story and character development was weak and uninteresting. The monsters appeared throughout the story like they did in ""Men in Black"" - disguised humans with ulterior motives, mainly intent on killing Percy. The greek mythology was confusing, with some explanations for some of the prominent gods and no explanations for others. I thought it was cute the way he described his dyslexia as being as result of having ancient Greek as his primary language, however I think his ADD excuses were contrived to try to make things sensible. He easily solved problems that he didn't even know were problems 5 minutes before. I was disappointed after all the hype and won't be reading the rest of the books as I heard they basically follow the same formula of book one."
139,140,1,"I did not enjoy this journey into 'The Heart of Western Civilisation'. (OMG the ego!) I couldn't wait to finish it.

The green cover edition looks a lot better. It may even have increased my reading pleasure if I'd been holding that edition. This cover features a boy who looks a few years older than Percy. It may be just the angle, but I don't think so. The green cover seems to depict a younger boy looking more vulnerable, which is a better fit and increases sympathy for the main character. Amazing, the power of a cover image... Maybe it's just me :-)

No, but seriously, I am not judging this book by its cover. I read it all the way through so that I could pass a fair judgement. I found it very thin, lacking in literary skill and that indefinable quality, charm. The preoccupation with the worst of US commercialism was very alienating. Such a shame. I studied classical civilisations at Uni and enjoy the original material enormously. I just didn't find it appealing in that setting. Too many tin cans, arcade games and guns. Ick!"
140,141,1,"I had been looking forward to this story so much, and it was just such a disappointment. Percy's voice felt so forced, the possible incredible world of the Gods was never developed, and every character was undeveloped. One minute Percy is talking about how lonely he is at the camp and the next he is gone and talking about how sad he is to leave. Everything was so rushed in the narrative - it felt like an endless series of action scenes thrown together with the barest hint of a real story behind them. Percy was only at his camp for a week (!!?!?!?!!) when he is sent on his quest. Yes - this boy has just found out he is a demi-god and has trained for one whole week and will now easily handle every monster sent his way; and just like that, he's on par with Theseus and Hercules. OK. What a missed opportunity to develop a world! I know it's not fair, but I couldn't help comparing this to Harry Potter - and Percy's world was so empty when placed next to Harry, Hogwarts, Hagrid, Dumbledore, the Weasleys..."
141,142,1,"Realize I am swimming upstream against the huge majority who really love this (so maybe I am truly missing the point) but this was just a huge miss for me.

The entirety felt like a desperate reconstruction of Harry Potter, and the umpteen similarities and out-right rip-offs pulled me out of a story that felt too thin to begin with, about a character I just couldn't connect to.

Percy has no emotional architecture. He says he's sad when his mother (seems to) die, but we don't feel it, he just carries on, biz as usual. Then he says he's a rebel and a 'bad kid' but...again we never see it. He doesn't really question anything fantastical that happens - ""Hey, I just killed my mean teacher with a sword that came outta nowhere. Pass the beer nuts"" - up to and including why his mother, depicted as some sort of saint, married someone as repugnant as Gabe.

So...apologies to anyone who is a Percy Jackson fanatic - I am you love it; we're to love books & stories & characters - but this one was just a huge disappointment to me."
142,143,1,"I know, I know, I know. I bet most of you are coming across this and thinking, ""How dare she give this...this...beautiful book a one-star review! Does she even know how big the fandom is?""
Yes...yes I do unfortunately, I live with people in the fandom. The reason that I'm giving this a one star review is...well...okay. First of all, I don't think that it has a great plot or was executed well. The idea was cool, especially because I love Greek mythology. It just seemed like the book does well...this.

Fake ex. ""We had just fought the big-headed monster. Then came another monster. Remember when I said the big-headed monster was the scariest monster ever. Well I had been wrong. This was the biggest monster EVER! I didn't know how I was gonna' live! Oh, wait...I defeated it.""

(This happens again for the rest of the book.)

The book also isn't written well. It uses language like ""real bad"" and it uses words that don't sound good in fight scenes (which make up the books.)

Overall, I just really don't like the Percy Jackson books."
143,144,1,"i was impressed until i read a bit more. it started to get more and more boring, then i just decided to put in never read again bin at home. i was impressed at the good text.. until i met the monsters.

i love Greek/Roman mythology! great books if they have myths, i know, right? But the (i forgot, read this november of 2020, correct me!) centaurs seemed like copying off Harry Potter and Pegasus, even though I knew it was a character from a myth. harry potter and pegasus are the best book series ever, in my opinion (other than wof), and if i think its copying of them, its in the dump immediately.

also, the movies are weird. everyones saying that, even the percy jackson fans-- but that just makes the book worse.

i got recommended by a librarian at barnes and nobles, and since everybody thought it was the best thing in the world, i decided to get book 1. everybody has different opinions, and thats mine. i watched two percy jackson movies, and that made the first book even more horrible. worst book."
144,145,1,
145,146,1,"This book is so frustrating.

I felt like I had ADHD as I was reading it, which, by the way, is NOT a clever plot device, it's just an annoying trait added to Percy in a desperate attempt to make him realistic.

No sooner would they stumble upon a bad guy than finish them off. It was too easy. I was bored, when I shouldn't have been. This happened frequently. So frequently in fact, I stood back and thought about how ridiculous it was. The entire novel is a ridiculous farce of pseudo-quests.

Despite its fast pace, Riordan felt it necessary to allude to a future event that happened maybe a page (read paragraph) later. ""This character seems odd. OH NOES, IT WANTS TO KILL ME!""

Worst of all, this CHILDREN'S book CONDONES MURDER. It does this quite explicitly, in fact, and makes no attempt to try and solve a (sadly) common real-life problem without resorting to violence. I was repulsed and horrified.

I begged for it to end."
146,147,1,"I normally adore young adult fiction, but this book didn't do it for me at all. I have never been as bored by a book in my life. I would go into more detail, except that would require me to waste more time on this terrible, terrible book.

- It's duplicative of Harry Potter.
- Percy is a total snooze and I was rooting for him to fail. In fact, it's quite an achievement that Riordan was able to make something so fascinating and exciting--Greek mythology, for [redacted] sake!--so tedious.
- It's ridiculous to say that this book should be graded on a curve because it was aimed at 10-year-olds. Good children's literature is enjoyable for all ages; in fact, it often becomes even more enjoyable when you read it as an adult because you pick up on themes that went over your head when you were younger. That doesn't happen here.

Read it at your own risk. If I could I would give this 0 stars."
147,148,1,"Mehh... Que desperdicio de tiempo, es lo aburrido que leí en mi vida. Muy tonto, se que es para adolescentes pero es tan ñoño... No me gustó nada y no conecté con la historia."
148,149,1,"The Lighning Theif was an almost exact replica of the Harry Potter sereis. What I mean by that is that there is some kind of ""bad guy"", Percy has lost both of his parents, a lot of characters, he got a scar in the end, and in the cover is both dragon teeth (basically the teeth in Harry Potter were he destroyed a horrocrux) and a sword (Godric Gryffindors sword Harry fought with)!

Overall this book is messy with action and sophisticated to understand. Dont recommend this book a tiny bit if you have read the Harry Potter seires because again almost an exact replica. Even if you havent read it, read the ""original"" first (Harry Potter sereis not Percy Jackson books)!

Note to the Writer of The Lighning Theif:

149,150,1,"I am noticing a pattern in Tween books where the author thinks that because his/her book is based on some preposterous premise, that this gives the author liberty to ignore all sense of reason. The premise in this book is that the main character, Percy, is part-Greek god or somesuch. In the first chapter, his class is at a museum for a fieldtrip, during which one of his teachers turns into a monster, tries to kill him, and ends up being killed by Percy. Later, he wonders if he imagined the whole thing. Then, his mom dies, but he's not upset about it because he thinks he'll be able to find her in the Underworld. Come on. Where's the emotional development of the character(s)? The book just races from one action sequence to another. It's like an action movie with very little substance. Very disappointing. I couldn't finish it."
150,151,1,"Percy Jackson is really done it this time. After getting kicked out of boarding school he fins out something very shocking. He is a demi-god, which means a child of a god and human. His father is Poseidon, the god of the sea. He goes to a camp to be safe that is called camp half-blood, where monsters can't find them. He has been accused of stealing Zues's Lightning Bolt. He and Annabeth are sent to retrieve it from Hades.
I can make a text to text connection. Some kids have no idea who their parents are, they may live with them but they are either not getting the love that every child ought to get or their parents have no time for children.
I gave this book 1 star. The book starts out really fun and exciting but then everything slow down and it takes you FOREVER to read it. I reccomend it to people who liek SI-Fi"
151,152,1,"I normally try to fight to the end of the book no matter how bad it is, but this one, I couldn't finish and had to stop. While I loved Harry Potter and did seem the similarities between the two, that wasn't a problem for me. I realized that I had no interest in the mythology story line. I felt like I needed a cheat sheet to tell me what the different creatures and gods were. The writing style was just amateurish – this is supposed to be a “young adult” book, so it shouldn’t be written like a kindergarten story! Percy’s confrontation in the beginning with his “teacher” was so lackluster that I thought I had skipped over a part but no, it was just that uneventful. I tried to keep going but then finally decided I didn't want to waste my time. I’ll stick to Harry Potter – this series is not for me!"
152,153,1,
153,154,1,"I felt a bit duped because of the book's mostly-good reviews, but then again, I did pick the book randomly while feeling nostalgic for Harry Potter, the reason that I still check out young adult books. (And that I love Greek history and mythology, but that's not here or there). Unfortunately, the setup and plot of this were too simplistic and not engaging, and I couldn't like any character despite trying. Recommended for elementary readers, probably not junior high though.

Perhaps I'm simply too old for this book, but I enjoyed and before, not to mention book 1 and recently (the latter after I read this book), which are all very appropriate for kids and great books to boot. And this books is a bit too similar to for me. So 1 star it is."
154,155,1,"My friend recommended this to me because I love Harry Potter. I found this to be TOO similar to Harry Potter, to the point of even annoying. I mean, a trio of 2 guys and a girl go away to a magical place to learn how to use magic/powers. (The girl is the smart one, the main character comes from a home where he doesn't quite fit in, [and also has a ""unusual trait"" that foreshadows his magical powers] and the other guy friend is the funny, quirky one.)They are sorted into different house upon arrival, and there are inner house competitions. A nasty blond kid is the bully to our main character, and there are also half-bloods. (People who are not truly magical) Then the main character finds out about a prophecy where he will be the one to kill the most powerful evil force in the modern world. I mean come on Rick!!!!!!"
155,156,1,"The book that I read is called the The Lightning Thief. It is about a twelve year old boy that finds out that he is half god and stuff. He also goes to a camp for kids just like him pretty much like xmen. except not really but kinda. Wall he is in this camp he finds out he is the son of poseidon wooow what a surprise. And in the end he gets the stuff back. The reason that I did rate this book really low is because it wasn't hard enough and it was kind of boring and it was weird. I would recommend this to nobody because it was not the greatest book that I have read but is was bad so don't read it. but I would recommend this book to people who like vanilla ice and to the nike factory and also trix are for kids also show respect at all times.

156,157,1,"I'm currently at 46% on Kindle, but I'm not sure if I'll finish.
I kept trying to read more since it has so many positive reviews and is recommended for Harry Potter fans -- I wanted to see if it would redeem itself later on. I liked some of the ideas --
ability to read Greek letters = dyslexic when comes to reading English, etc, but the plot/writing so far is only ok (there definitely are holes in logic) and the writing level is no where near JK Rowling's level. The characters aren't well-developed and seem like very shallow versions of Harry Potter characters.

(Percy = Harry
Grover = Ron
Annabeth = annoying version of Hermione)

Also, none of the adults in the camp for half-bloods bother to explain anything. Monsters/quests/whatever just get randomly thrown in without explanation. Not enough world-building!"
157,158,1,"I must say, this one started off great. I was immediately enjoying it. I can’t tell you where exactly but somewhere along the way, maybe when Percy made it to Camp Half-Blood, I started losing interest. Maybe I’m too much of a Harry Potter fan and felt it was trying too hard to be like HP but also not be like HP so it wouldn’t be noticeable that it’s trying to be just like HP. Maybe I love originality, but I was relieved to finish reading this book. I wasn’t a fan of the writing style and I don’t understand how Percy, Grover, and Annabeth became the greatest of friends. There was no growth in their friendship. It felt forced, in my opinion. I didn’t care about the characters. I wanted to like it, especially since I had high hopes in the beginning. The plot wasn’t a shock—I figured it out as soon as Percy received his prophecy. This just wasn’t for me."
158,159,1,"I don't recommend this book at all.
I only started reading it because it could help me at school. Really it is time wasting. It annoyed me how similar to Harry Potter this was, and not in the good way. Black haired 12 year old with green eyes? Sounds familiar? And not only that. A poor written, cheap copy of Harry Potter.
Don't get me started on the Greek mythology. How could Athena have children? How? She swore when she was borned out of Zeus's head that she will forever be a maid, same as Artemis. But guess what? Suddenly Athena broke her oath, and not once. One of the things Athena was known (apart from the fact that she was the goddess of wisdom, war tactics and so on) for swearing that she will be a maid forever. But I guess Rick Riordan couldn't have found some other goddess.

I really don't want to offend the fans, but this is my opinion."
159,160,1,"You could tell when you read this that it's meant for viewers of around the age of 12, which a little bothered me, but otherwise the story was pretty interesting. I love mythology and it seemed like Riordan was trying to teach the readers about it a bit. In some areas I think it was a bit unrealistic. Like how easy it was for Percy to hurt the God of War, Ares. His friends, Grover and Annabeth practically did nothing during the whole quest, they seemed like just support. I hope the movie isn't too over exaggerated.

However I will be reading the rest of the series. I think it is just hard for authors to make a story interesting when you have an oracle tell you what's going to happen in the beginning."
160,161,1,"this is an unfair review. This book did not really deserve a rating of 1 star, just a bad match between book and reader.

I'm 42. The book is clearly a junior/young adult book, and while I and many other adults enjoy many of the books in this genre, I didn't feel this one worked well as an adult read. I found it boring and didn't finish it. It didn't have the depth, layers or detail of a book like The Golden Compass or the Harry Potter series. However, kudos to the author for making Greek myths popular with young boys. At the time this came out I was working in the children's book section of a bookstore, not only was this series very popular with 8-12 year olds (mainly boys), but they also came in looking for non-fiction on Greek mythology."
161,162,1,"I kept flipping back and forth between giving this book 1/2 stars as I read it. honestly I LOVE Greek/Roman mythology one of my strong suits so I figured this would be a good read. about 30 pgs in I could sense I wouldn't like it; too easy, omitting facts, etc. percy was supposed to be an awful student so how does he always have a sudden spark of unexplained knowledge. I thought diction was far too easy, only reason I read it was bc it went by so fast. also, I don't understand why the author sped certain things up (ie, diner and arcade scenes). but my real issue with the book is that long before percy meets each important character or god, I knew what was going to happen several pgs ahead of time. not worth the read if you ask me it's simply an elementary approach to Greek mythology"
162,163,1,"Twaddle. Complete twaddle. More than that, it's poorly disguised derivative twaddle. Percy has black hair and green eyes. Hmmmm--where have we seen that before? He doesn't know he has special powers, though strange things have happened to him his entire life. Dark beings from a dark world want to kill him. And he finds all this out as he enters adolescence.

Puh-leese. We've seen this before, and done so much better. The writing is so choppy I nearly got seasick. The characters, including Percy, are poorly drawn and unlikable. Bad, bad, bad. I gave it 60 pages--a generous 20 more than my ""40 page rule"" allows--before snapping it shut and flinging it aside, even though it is a library book.

Twaddle. I'd give it zero stars if I could."
163,164,1,"Sorry middle school girls everywhere, I was not a fan of Percy Jackson. The book was just full of super random things happening - oh, now we're in a hotel that traps people forever - and I refuse to believe that Percy and the gang just happen to stumble upon all of the gods that happen to be hiding out in the US. It was just all too much to me, and I'm a big fan of invented universes (Hello, Harry Potter series!). Also, all of the ""obstacles"" the three travelers overcome seem super obvious and easy. Like, I could overcome those obstacles and my dad's just a printer. I have absolutely no desire to read the rest of the books in the series or see the movie. Sorry Rick, but The Lightning Thief would not make my book of top 100 anything."

It's easy to say that I actually hated this book."
167,168,1,"I love Greek Mythology and I've been brought up in the cultural beliefs. This book isn't it.

Rick Riordan is very sexist. The girl characters Percy doesn't like are all described as ugly and masculine, and it was pushed to a point that the reader needs to know that masculine traits in a girl or a woman means that she is evil... sure...
Not only that, but Rick Riordan would push this point across, every time he saw a demigod of Ares. I don't know if you know this Riordan.... but demigods are not considered ugly...

In Greek mythology, the demigods are described with having ichor running through their veins (the golden blood of the gods) so that means they are golden in appearance, hair, eyes, and skin making the demigods extremely attractive to the human eye..."
168,169,1,I hated every second of reading that book.
169,170,1,"An original take on Greek mythology but it was a long haul. I have to say the movie was better. The book felt so childish and I wouln't reccommend it to teenages i really wanted more to the battle scenes. Some of the action was a bit hard to follow too, especially when you're falling asleep with bordom. Sadly the characters were unlovable especially Annabeth she could really get on the nerves and sometimes I felt as if Percy were a bit stupid. The only valuable character was Grover and even then I couldn't quite figure him out. A bit of a dissapointment really considering how great the movie is. I guess I've learnt not to watch the movie before reading the books."
170,171,1,"My opinion is not entirely fair. This story is clearly aimed at young teenagers, which I am not anymore, so I should've known better.. But I picked it up a while ago to see what it was about and all I can say is that I should have read this when I was 14. I probably would have thought it was exciting and clever. Unfortunately (or: thank god) I've changed a bit since I was 14 and now I expect a bit more from a story. Where Harry Potter, the Hobbit or the BFG are children's stories that can also be enjoyed by adults, this is a young teenager's story that can only be enjoyed by young teenagers. I do however recommend it to them, because I really think I would have loved it at that age."
171,172,1,"I really wanted to like this book because I love Greek/Roman mythology and it seemed like a modern-day twist on it would be interesting. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with the story overall. The main character is not a very good role model and many situations in the story seem inappropriate for the age-group that it's aimed at. But let's face it, Greek/Roman mythology really isn't appropriate for younger children in the first place so I guess that's the first problem. There were some clever parts with modern-day versions of ancient characters but overall it was pretty lame. I may still read the rest of the series and see if it gets any better, though."
172,173,1,"I thought this book was terrible. Yes. I mean it. I don't like Percy Jackson.
Before I continue, I need to say a few things: Although I didn't like this book, I respect the author. Rick Riordan has a lot of writing talent. What I do not respect is the way that he used his talents for this book.
Greek mythology has never been my thing. I really don't like it, so when I finally gave in and read this one; I didn't expect to like it. So, if anyone ever hears me say I don't like Percy Jackson, that is why. And that is my opinion and I will stick with it. But Rick Riordan is a good writer."
173,174,1,"This was the worst book ever. I could not even finish the story, because it was 100% the worst novel in all history, that it could not even be classified as a novel. THank you Rick RIordan for ruining my fourth grade experience as a reader, and playing the role as the most discouraging author in all history of books which I have ever read. I hope that you put more thought into your next book, or do not write one. This was a plagiarism to greek authors like Homer, who created fables and stories that depicted the Greek gods, and then you made it into your own writing, and passed it off as your own."
174,175,1,
175,176,1,"Oh dear! What is with me and well-loved books? I seem to love those the least! ‘The Lightning Thief’ didn’t steal my heart. It didn’t even steal a minute’s space on my memory shelf. I started off reading it without knowing much of Greek mythology and that was a mistake because to read this, you do need a fair bit of understanding of all the Greek Gods and their stories. I didn’t. Still, I ploughed on womanfully. Mistake. I can’t take well to books that read like fast-action movies. I get a headache. This was just like a James Bond thriller combined with the Hobbits. I was glad to reach the predictable end."
176,177,1,"I kind of hated this book. Of course, I'm not a 12-year-old boy, nor am I interested in mythology. If I were either of the two, I might like it better. Instead, I'm a grown woman who loves to read well-written books that show me things instead of telling me. This book is not that book. It's terribly predictable, and it seems that Riordan tried his darnedest to cram Greek god stuff onto every page. Tip to the author: there doesn't have to be a near-death experience in every scene. I speed-read the last 100 pages just to be done with it."
177,178,1,"Stupid book, Rick Riodan's writing style reminds me of that of a ten year olds. It was entirely pointless, the plot was not only implausible but it was boring, and hard to follow. The ridiculous banter and dialog between the young children in the book turned me off to it even more. They are only like, twelve, and they do not make for interesting characters. I found them all very flat. There was no meaning to the book, it was just cheap action, and the Greek references were way beyond the target audience."
178,179,1,"I read this book because I had to, not because I wanted to. I honestly had no desire to read it, and my suspicions were right. It was a very mediocre read, and I probably wouldn't even have read it if I had been the same age as the book. Not only was it predictable, it had crude slap-stick comedy. Seriously, exploding toilets or something like that? I do like the original intent...kids with disabilities maybe having more to them...a special power or whatnot. It is an ice idea, but I just couldn't enjoy this book on any level."
179,180,1,"So, I couldn't finish this, even though I got pretty far. It might have been better if I read it instead of listening to the audio book. I would still recommend it to young readers, I mean it's been popular so it must have something going for it. I just really disliked the tone, and especially read aloud I got tired of Percy's narration. I couldn't get into the action. My mind wandered and I wasn't interested enough to rewind. Does the series get better? I love the idea, but the execution of it was disappointing."
180,181,1,"DNF

I tried this one a while back and haven't managed to pick it up again. Percy managed to rub off on my the wrong way, especially between his humor, and his lack of maturity.

I remember being especially appalled by his rudeness to his stepfather, although I remember the stepfather being quite horrible, I still found Percy's actions incredibly immature.

I also found his crush on Annabelle rather puzzling, they are not super closely related, but they are what? Cousins? Second cousins? I don't know.

I guess it wasn't for me. Ah well."
181,182,1,"0.5 stars
This book was very overhyped do not recommend I've read better lame rather would read Harry Potter the original not the copy. I don't understand why you would learn Greek mythology in Latin class and chiron is a really crappy latin teacher because Latin and Greek are two completely different languages,cultures and mythology


Camp half blood is a torture camp for kids and I Hated this book and it hurt me really really bad NEVER READ IT OR BUY THIS BOOK MOST OVERHYPED BOOK OF THE MILLENIA"
182,183,1,"I understand that this series is middle grade, so of course it's going to be a little simpler and a little more predictable, but that's no excuse for poor writing and poor plotting. Middle graders deserve well-written literature too - and of course they HAVE a ton of great options! I have to believe this series is hugely popular because of the really awesome concept...the execution of that concept is *not good*.

I also really disliked the actor for the audiobook. I'd probably finish this one if I were reading it, but I'm not willing to devote 5 more hours of listening."
183,184,1,"this book is trash. i know YA can be a dicey genre, but i mean, jesus christ. this is the most hamfisted attempt to modernize greek mythology that i've ever had the misfortune to encounter. and the writing is SO POOR. when i think of YA, i assume the writing is geared towards teenagers, but quite honestly, i think my toddler would be insulted if i tried to read this to him and quickly insist we get back to 'this little president', which is better written and far more entertaining AND educational."
184,185,1,This book is a waste of my time. Still haven't found a book that I like. I thought that the main character. Would always ask a question. No one would answer his question. I thought that was annoying because why even ask that if now one will answer it. I found it confusing because one second he is fighting a teacher with a pen. Then there in a car driving in a storm. I find it funny that his mom couldn't beat a monster but a kid with know idea of his powers beats it. That is most of why I do not like this book.
185,186,1,"Wow. Two back-to-back books in a row I did not like very much. But this one, was the worst. I know it is tremendously popular. And, I read a LOT of YA Fantasy but this one was just so...so something. Characters without depth and feeling, no deeper meaning in the plot (which all the best Fantasy books always seem to have...with Harry Potter being supremely wonderful at achieving), and, by the last third of the book, just trying to get through to the end. Can understand how 3rd & 4th grade readers (and above) might like it who do not expect more than superficial ""action"" in a book."
186,187,1,"DID NOT FINISH

I rarely stop a book in the middle, but very early into this reading, I realized that the book wasn't for me. I like Greek Mythology quite a bit, but the writing style is so tailored towards a younger audience that I couldn't read on. I considered giving the first book a chance to see if the writing matured, but then I realized that I would inevitably want to read on in this series, so I decided that this experience would not be a good use of my time.

I liked the two movies based on these books OK, but I have only seen them once each."
187,188,1,"I don't like fantasy in general, but I read this because my daughter had to read it for school and needed some help. This is a complete ripoff of Harry Potter with a skin of Greek mythology. The voice and writing style was done in a way that the author clearly was playing for this to be made into a movie. I felt like it was written as a money-maker and the plot and action were forced, and I don't like being played for someone's wallet. The only redeeming factor was that I love Greek mythology so I liked being reintroduced to the Greek gods & personalities."
188,189,1,"I can't believe I got to the end of this book. I hated it. I bought the series to give to my nephews (and I read most of the books I buy for them before I hand them over) but I feel bad for them and only hope they end up loving it despite the crap this story is full of. If they don't like it, I will understand why.

It was so boring and the narrator just had annoying voices for each character, so this didn't help the book.

If you decide to read this series, I hope you end up like it more than those of us who gave it a low score."
189,190,1,"HOW COULD ANYONE BE OKAY WITH THIS BOOK. My seven year old started to read this book, and it's not appropriate for my sweet little angel. I live in a Christian, God-abiding household and this atrocity is going to damage my child's mind. The idea that there is more than one God is a sin, and this book is promoting the will of the Devil. Anyways, I hope this author learns how harmful his view are because I cannot condone this type of behavior in my life. I'm not okay with this at all in the least."
190,191,1,"I'm clearly not the audience for this book, but I decided to read it anyways because of the high reviews and a personal recommendation from someone I know. I thought that despite the fact it might be written for a younger audience, it might have an appeal to older readers similar to the charm of Harry Potter. I was wrong. The book was irritating. It was especially irritating when you just finished several books on Greek mythology. This book butchers the classic Greek mythology and attempts to modernize it.

I can't understand why this series is so overrated."
191,192,1,"I read this to Spencer in the car as we commuted back and forth from seeing the cousins. He liked it, I thought it was L-A-M-E. Seriously, terrible. Maybe it would have been better if I had read it to myself, some books are like that, but I was not impressed at all. My biggest pet peeve with the book was that the bad guy would totally explain himself before trying to off the hero. This happened more than once. I am not a fan."
192,193,1,"I read this book because it was fairly popular among a lot of my older students and they would often talk about it. Generally the kids spoke highly of it, so I wanted to read it to be able to talk to them about it. I ended up listening to this one on tape while commuting, and didn't really enjoy it. I can see how kids, studying Greek mythology would enjoy it. But to me, the book just dragged on and on and didn't hold my attention at all. Oh well."
193,194,1,"Riordan writing is poor. He obviously doesn't know when to be funny (he is not) or when to create suspense (there is some, but Percy's I-know-I-can't-die-it's-just-first-book narration kills it). Plot is too simple, 50% of a book consists of ""pick a mythical creature, let it attack Percy, Percy defeats it/escapes"" scenario over and over. Book ends with murder, but it's not a bad guy who kills someone but an adult and, which is most puzzling, Riordan expect reader to be cheerful about it."
194,195,1,"Don't waste your time! You can guess the entire story just by looking at the cover. Yes, just like Harry Potter, he is the unwilling chosen hero to save the world. Pretty much delivers the satisfaction of power and revenge a kid would want in a book--meaning, it's not sophisticated. I read this before the movie and thought he wrote aiming to get bought and turned into a movie. Lots of action, caricatured characters so anyone can easily understand, thin enough to not bore."
195,196,1,"I admit it, I can't even finish this. I can't get past the voice of the main character who sounds like a grown up trying too hard (and failing miserably) to sound like a kid. Add that to the lack of a realistic response by the kid to all these weird things that are happening to him, and I can go no further. I was pre-reading this for my 7.5 year old who is finishing up Harry Potter. Harry Potter this is not. Too bad I purchased this and can't just return it to the library!"
196,197,1,"Average at best, ridiculously juvenile in some places. A book meant for readers far younger to me, I guess. At least, I hope that is what the intended target audience was. Otherwise, well.. Let's not go there, shall we.. I could tear into this book, right here right now, but I REALLY believe it was intended for younger readers. And no, I am NOT going to read the other gawd-knows-how-many parts, thank you very much."
197,198,1,"I can't stand the first person POV. I don't give a shit about half the crap he worries about. And I didn't like how Grover didn't tell him important shit in the beginning. What an ass. And Annabeth is just a bitch. She doesn't want to be Percy's friend because of dumb ass family drama between their parents? Seriously? Parents who abandoned them, like why are you paying tribute to them?
Overall good storyline, just lame characters."
198,199,1,"This was the first book by Rick Riordan that I have read, or rather part read, and I am afraid it will be the last. I have read reviews comparing this book to the Harry Potter books, but in my opinion to do so is a huge insult to J.K.Rowling. I managed to get 47% of the way through the book, and believe me that was a struggle. When I get into a book I usually find it difficult to put it down. In this case I found it difficult to find sufficient enthusiasm to pick the thing up."
199,200,1,"This is the only one of the series that I've read, and I didn't expect it to a children's books when I picked it up. Honestly, with such a neat idea, it could have been made into a great adult oriented book. Maybe I'm being selfish, wanting to steal it from pre-teens. The concept of children being borne of Olympian gods, it could have been way more brutal and badass than just a camp for half bloods. But this is my discerning and very picky opinion, take it with a slight grain of salt."
200,201,1,I didn't like this book because I am not very familiar with greek mythology. It has to much mythology and is very confusing if you don't know your facts. I definitely would not recommend this unless you really know about greek gods and goddesses.I prefer the other series Rick Riordan wrote that is called The Heroes of Olympus. While this book has greek mythology it does not have as much and I think it is a much better book.
201,202,1,"This book was pretty stupid. When Percy arrives at camp, everyone acts like he should know things, as if they don't understand that he's the new kid that just found out he's the son of a Greek god. The gods can see and know so much of what is happening, unless it's inconvenient for the story. Percy falls into obvious traps, even mentioning that he shouldn't trust anyone, but he trusts them anyway. I could go on and on, but basically, the story was flimsy and most of the characters were idiots."
202,203,1,"Read it because my year six boys were reading it and had had some difficulty retaining the plot...their fault not the authors. I am just not into Greek legends etc, and found the writing a bit lame. But at least I can discuss the plot with my students and perhaps redirect them to other reading. I suspect they too are unfamiliar with the world of myth and legend and therefore found the twists in the plot difficult."
203,204,1,"This is a pretty good book for those who are into Greek and Roman mythology and action. Its about a boy who finds out that all his life was a lie and he is actually a demigod who is protected by his best friend Grover. This leads him back to a special camp for demigods in which he is sent on a quest to bring back the lightning bolt and save the world from a battle between gods. I would say, overall it is a pretty well written book. I just don't believe it to be of interest to me."
204,205,1,"I thought that the Greek mythology premise was quite interesting, which kept me reading until the end. I will probably keep reading the series through to the end. But I thought that the characters were so boring and dull.

Most of the Interesting things about the book seemed to be a complete rip-off from Harry Potter, the characters, Teams, chosen child etc.

I would say 2/5 stars. Hopefully the sequels are better!"
205,206,1,"I didn't like this book.I tried to get into mythology as my classmate Bryan recommend this book to me.I did not like it.It was very challenging and hard.I kept getting confused,I didn't know what was happening.The books were also not my type.Overall, if you are not into the mythology type of books but want to try something new I recommend you don't, just stay with the topic you usually read about."
206,207,1,"All action and no character development. That's how I would describe this book. It felt like epic battle after battle with very little back story. I found myself not caring what happened to the main characters because I had not developed an emotional attachment to them. I listened to this as an audiobook and because I was not into it, I found it REALLY hard to not to daydream about something else while listening."
207,208,1,I found this a pretty decent book and I have found myself kind of wanting to read the next four. Despite its few flaws I enjoyed certain aspects and like how Rick added in a few environmental messages about litter and how kids spend ages on video games. I didnt't like the fact of how long it was when it could've been a bit shorter but I suppose that's because it's the first book and needs to set a few things up like the cool and interesting plot.
208,209,1,"This is my live review as I read the book.

Chapter 1
A 12 year old boy says he is a half-blood. The students in his school take Latin.

The things being discussed in this book make me feel too old to be reading it. Someone is described as eating a peanut butter and ketchup sandwich. I am sure kids will have some humorous reaction to that, but I just want to put the book down and leave it for them to enjoy."
209,210,1,"I don't understand why it is so popular... That camp half-blood felt like a bad version of Hogwarts and the characters were damn annoying and one-dimensional (I hated the female protagonist the most)
The writing style was simple and childish, and I read it when I was quite young and even liked shit like Twilight
The plot is very predictable and I couldn't recall any plot-twists
I gave it to my (back then) ten year old sister and even she thought of the protagonists as annoying"
210,211,1,"I truly don’t understand why this is so popular. I think the premise is great, but it’s so poorly written I’m astounded this author is so popular. As a librarian I’m embarrassed that I’ve been recommending this (based on the recommendation of other librarians and library resources)....At some point I may try a different series by this author to try and give them another chance, but until then, I think I’ll have to offer an alternative to kids!"
211,212,1,Parents beware! I have read this author as an adult and for the most part had to ignore the numerous type-o's from Disney. But then the author decided to jump on the gay parade and made one of the kids gay through NO character development. The character never showed any propensity of being gay but was dealing with grief and hero worship. Severally disappointed in Disney and Rick Riordan. So sad as he showed such promise. I do not recommend this series as safe for kids.
212,213,1,"Lots and lots of teen and pre-teen books are great for adults too; this is not one of those books. Severely lacking in continuity, character motivation, dialogue... You name it. All aimed straight at the sensibilities and world view of an 11 year old boy. The Greek myth background is fun and has tons of potential, but is just so hacked together that it is really just a hash.

So... perhaps a great kids book but I can't recommend it at all. Zero stars."
213,214,1,"I was recommended this book by my friend's Lil brother, he warned me that people who usually like wizarding ward don't end up liking this book, I wanted to give it a try to see whether the assumption is true or not.
Unfortunately, the assumption is turning into a reality. The first part that is chapters 1-9 is slow for me, the book does not evoke any sense of curiousness. I might pick up the book again but right now it's difficult for me to keep on reading the book."
214,215,1,"Instead of being like ""If you're different, that's fine, there really is no such thing as ""normal"" and you're not any less of a person"" this book is like ""Have a mental illness or disability? Have you considered you might be a DEMI-GOD???""

If there were evidence for demi-gods this may be a reasonable line of thinking, but with the current scientific understanding I'd say it's an unhealthy point of view."
215,216,1,"I am just going to directly quote from the essay I wrote about this book in sixth grade, because I feel like that says it all. ""Rick Riordan, a dull and lousy author, has somehow turned the riveting, enthralling topic of the Greek gods into a predictable and utterly humdrum novel titled The Lightning Thief."" ""Percy Jackson is a bit like a knock-off Harry Potter."" ""In conclusion, this book failed to differentiate itself in any way from the vast majority of children’s novels."""

217,218,1,"DNF. I regret wasting audible credit on this book. YA fantasy is one of my favorite genres (in my 40s), but this book failed to capture me. Simplistic storylines and paper-thin characterizations do not a good book make. I disliked the author’s take on Greek mythology and how the “gods” were randomly based in America because apparently American culture is the epitome of Western civilization or something like that. Moving on…"
218,219,1,"I could not finish this book; I forget how far I got, but I was not at all interested. It didn't really offer anything new on the 'orphan with powerful biological parent' theme, and I didn't care what happened. Maybe the series gets better, but I won't likely try to read another one in the series. Or maybe I was just having a bad day."
219,220,1,"I had heard great things about this series, but I was really disappointed. It reminded me of the goosebumps series (I only got through half of one). The writing was so dumbed down, and I hate that in kids literature. The Greek Mythology woven in was fun, but it could have been great... and it just wasn't. I'll pass on reading this to my boys."
220,221,1,Rarely ever do I not finish a book that I start reading. This one I have decided I don't care about Percy or any other character in the book. I understand that this is a young adult novel but the writing is very simplistic. I was hoping to find a character that I cared about like Harry Potter or at least good writing and I found neither in this book.
221,222,1,"I heard that the movie on this book was coming out soon so I decided to read this. Not a Harry Potter book, but a Harry Potter wanna be. I didn't feel that it was very well written and it had a slow beginning. I was into the book 100 pages before it turned interesting. The book was ok but I wouldn't read it again and don't care if I read any of the others in the series."
222,223,1,"We really need to expect more from literature. And can't we please have a character who actually solves his own problems instead of everything happening Deus-ex-machina? The premise was good, but it felt like the writer just whipped this out without working it up at all. I'm not going to be reading the next ones. There are just much better books out there. The dyslexia stuff was funny though :)."
223,224,1,boringgg. i read some and then put it down because of boredom. ZzZzZz most of the time. it's too much back and forth. one minute they're killing medusa next their going someplace then 2 seconds after medusa this dog lady comes. i have no intention of reading the rest of the series and donnot reccomend this book.
224,225,1,"This book is a lame Harry Potter rip off! Point by point: ""Um, wizards are taken, so this kid'll be the son of a god!"" ""Uh, he needs two friends to go with him on adventures--a scaredy-cat guy friend, and a super smart girl pal!"" The sole redeeming feature is Percy's refreshingly down-to-earth first person narration. His self-awareness is a good model of writing for teen students."
225,226,1,"I listened to the audio version of this. I think this is a classic example of how the wrong reader can butcher a book. I have friends that really liked it, but they way it was read…horrible! Every flaw, every nuance, every unnecessary story repeat shone like a bright street light. Do not listen to the audio version."
226,227,1,This book is great because the kid is half human and he have a weapon that is like a pencil and the pencil is powerful.He is like the god of water he have a father and his father is cool.He have a friend that he control light and the important things is in the end of the book because the kig fight his friend but the kid of water was nice and he wins the fight.
227,228,1,"I did not enjoy this book. The premise is exciting, but the execution is terrible. And I'd feel this way even if it weren't completely copying the Harry Potter formula at every turn.

My 7-year-old son is enjoying the book, although he can't fully grasp the complex Greek mythology. I will be interested to see if he wants to read the other books in the series. I certainly don't."
228,229,1,"Bleh. The idea was interesting enough, but I thought it was executed very poorly, which is a shame because I LOOOOVE Greek mythology. I also found it so predictable that I wanted to skim. All in all, this is one of those books where I actually thought the movie made parts better. haha. Unfortunately, I read through the whole thing hoping it would redeem itself. Never did, for me anyways."
229,230,1,"This story takes the main character on a journey across the U.S., but the author did not bother to look at a map or do any fact checking. For a YA novel, this is one of the most disjointed I've encountered. The story itself is intriguing, but it was poorly executed and felt incredibly shallow (from the characters to the depth of plot)."
230,231,1,"What not to read after finishing a semester of Classical Literature. This book botches and/or waters down most of Greek/Roman mythology. That's not a huge problem, though, even though it's annoying. I would forgive that if the story was actually compelling, but the characters are shallow, the writing grates and the plot is pretty boring."
231,232,1,"As one who appreciates Greek mythology, I feel obligated to at least give this book a little praise, but the reality is this: it is lame. I was never sold on the characters, every problem, battle, or situation was resolved a little too easily and neatly for me, and the voice was horribly grating.

I'm not a fan."
232,233,1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. I can't even write a review, I don't want to think about it. Maybe my taste has gotten too used to young adult books to go back to straight-up children's books? Not sure. I didn't find anything about this book believable, which is the first requirement for a good story."
233,234,1,"Exceptionally kiddy. To anyone who responds with ""duh, it's a kids' book"", I refer you to Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland, The Hobbit, The Chronicles of Narnia, etc etc. I usually like to comment on one thing that I did like about a book, which I give a poor rating to but I can't think of a single thing, except maybe the cover art."
234,235,1,"To be honest, I got about half way through and just lost interest.

The story line was decent, but the characters seemed unusually dense though. I mean it took the daughter of the goddess of wisdom more than 5 minutes to discover Percy's bloodline. It was obvious to me from minute one and I know almost nothing of Greek mythology.

I may pick this book up at a later date. Just not sure"
235,236,1,"pretty simple plot - vowed to go through this series only after i thought that fantasy fiction can be an interesting genre- well, nothing interesting about this book - its very linear - and well I guess I am not amongst the book's intended audience, but since i have started the series - i am impelled to finish it too."
236,237,1,"I have nothing good to say about this book. I don't think that anybody is wrong for liking this book, but I just hated it. I can't wrap my head around it but I just can't stand this book. I personally thought it was beyond boring and couldn't get myself to like it. Once again not criticizing anyone who likes this book I just don't like it."
237,238,1,"Quite interesting.
I did not like the repetitiveness of some events. The similarities and cliches of every middle grade book. And the predictable and unrealistic plot.-he won over the war god, really?-
Other than that, it was a meh book, I did not expect to get something out of it and I did not.
(Hades is my favorite.)"
238,239,1,"I heard that this book was really good and was kind of like my favorite sic-fi books, plus I like mythology, so I was like why not? I tried reading it about 3 times and got through 100 pages, and couldn't keep on going. Nothing about this book interested me. It was all so boring and I was pushing through it, hoping that it would get better, but it didn't."
239,240,1,"Could not stand this book for the life of me.

They literally got attacked by some sort of monster in every single chapter.

The only reason I finished it was because I made a deal with my sister that I'd read Percy Jackson if she read the Unwind Series by Neal Shusterman.

She got the better end of the deal."
240,241,1,I was very interested in this series for the longest time. I heard tons of great things so I gave in and bought the box set. This book was torture. I know this series is Disney and I know it's for YA but I still expected more than what it was giving me. I may be too old for this series but I could not even finish.
241,242,1,"My god, the Babysitters Club books were better written than this. What is this garbage. The dialogue is painfully clunky and the plot turns are embarrassingly dumb. I wish this story was handed over to an actual writer, because it is strikingly clear that Riordan has no skill or training in the matter."
242,243,1,"Read this only because Linzaloo has been bugging me for half a decade about it. JUST FOR YOU, LOODLES. I knew I'd wouldn't like it because I hate Greek mythology. I felt like banging my head against a wall so many times. Also, the whole trying-to-be-like-Harry Potter issue annoyed me, as I knew it would! BUT I READ IT, LINZ, OKAY?!! :D"
243,244,1,
244,245,1,"DNF @ ~25%

This one really was just not for me. I just got such a 'post HP, young YA vibe' from it. Sorry, tumblr, I know you wanted me to love this one due to later characters/arcs, but I just cannot get there."
245,246,1,"Excellent idea, terrible writing and idiotic characters. Some good ideas that are never followed through, and foreshadowing that ruins absolutly everything leaving no tension at all. It reads like an okay-written fanfic. I do not recommend this book (or series) at all.

Full review on my blog:"
246,247,1,"it sucks ass and seems as if it was written by a five year old version of myself. There's nothing more to add except that it's overrated and if you liked this book, please comment your age and anger since i find it very amusing. thank you percy jackson, for blinding me with cringe-attacks and making my insides slowly die. :)"
247,248,1,"Let's compare.
1. One of the major themes that weaves through all seven Harry Potter books is the death of his parents. Percy Jackson is sad for less than a chapter.
2. Another theme that weaves through all seven Harry Potter books is the extraordinary protective power of love: the deepest magic. The Olympians?
To quote Dickens: ""Bah, humbug!"""
248,249,1,Honestly this was one of the worst books I’ve ever read. If I could give it zero stars that is what I would give it. Rick tried to give the gods a personality and completely failed honestly it was hard to read and now I’m going to go and read a decent book and hope I can mentally block this one out from my memories.
249,250,1,"DNF.
I got about a quarter through and could not finish. This seems to suit the age range of 6-9, yet even if I had read it as a child, it would not have been enjoyable for me.
It’s incredibly simplistic writing style and immature, campy humor was too much to bear.
Half my mind was asleep while reading.
Not imaginative or exciting."
250,251,1,"This book is not good to me because the book had no animals in it.
But I like that a mako shark is in the book.
I also like the animals in the zoo transport truck.
I would suggest the author should add King Kong and Dinosaurs in it.
I would recommend the book because it had a lion,zebra,antelope and shark."
251,252,1,
252,253,1,"I‘m sorry but that just wasn’t it. It felt like a child had written the book, the writing was just so bad. I did not feel a thing for Percy or his story. All the time I just thought how dumb he is and the plot points made literally no sense. It was really hard to get trough it and I was really relieved one it was over."
253,254,1,"I was looking for something to read and because this kept being recommended to me I read it.
Thoughts:
plot: overused incidents, predictable
humor: cliche
characters: unoriginal
dialogue: lack of flow
After considering the book when I finished it, at least I could see why people like it, although that did not induce me to like it."
254,255,1,"This felt like a Harry-Potter-wannabe. I'm sorry but no human (i know he's a halv-god but He still has human feelings) acts like He does. It just made me cringe reading 12 y/o Percy with hero-thoughts, i mean Come on, he's twelve.
Also The third perspective thing wasn't written good.
Good idea though."
255,256,1,"I'm probably the only person in the world who doesn't like the Percy Jackson, but it was just too action packed, almost. Every single chapter, I mean, there's just one thing after another. I love the characters, the plot is good, and the way it's written is decent. For some reason, it just didn't appeal to me when it's all put together."
256,257,1,"I will not finish this book. I only read 25% of it, but it is too much like Harry Potter, and not nearly as good. I find it hard to believe that any child who has already read Harry Potter would enjoy this book. I would have difficulty recommending it to anyone because I think the overall idea of it is much too similar to Harry Potter."
257,258,1,"This book was nothing of what I expected. I even read the whole series and series after because(hero’s of Olympus) everyone said it was such a good book and I was just waiting for that one really good part everyone tells me about but it never came. It is not worth the time. Try the first book and if you do it like it, don’t continue."
258,259,1,"Started this one as part of a reading list only to realise it is probably a children's book (and not Young Adult).
Even by those standards it is poorly written with a boring story and a predictable ending. It is based on just one idea, fit elements of Greek mythology in the modern world. Even that looks like force fitting in quite a few places."
259,260,1,"This book was fine not amazing. It has magic and is fairly gripping and hard to put down. But, the plot falls flat and there is very little showing. I like the idea of children of immortals but the writing wasn't good enough to carry it."
260,261,1,"I just couldn't finish this book. Generally, I have no trouble with willingly suspending my disbelief--this just went too far for me. I also felt that hints to the plot line were heavy-handed--more whacks in the head than anything. Sorry...I just could not get into this."
261,262,1,"Meh, I'm not a huge fan. The really juvenile voice bothered me, a lot of details and components of the magical world were inconsistent and sloppy-seeming. I liked the Greek Mythology aspects, but I felt that was one of the onyl differences between this and Harry Potter."
262,263,1,"The next time I want to read about a teenage boy who didn't know he was magical and then has to save the world with a smart girl and a funny guy, I'll that other series.
I was ok with the simularities, but the story was so forced. And it had monologues at the end. I hate that."
263,264,1,"The story was fairly entertaining, but it just seemed like such a rip-off of Harry Potter to me. Plus, like my brother-in-law pointed out, it is a story about the illegitimate children of gods. I could see how teens would really enjoy this, though."
264,265,1,This book is boring. It is too heavy into greek myth with a weird adolescent perspective. I saw the movie and it was okay. It did not follow the book which I think is a good thing. The book had too many mini adventures that were lame.
265,266,1,"Percy is half blood. He is half human and half god ! trying to save his moms life. making friends and having enemys.he goes through many problems through the book.
i cannot CONNECT ANY WAY.
Terrible book very boring nothing,"
266,267,1,"I always loved reading Greek mythology as a kid and had high hopes for this, but just thought it was painfully by-the-numbers. I wanted an entertaining, breezy fantasy, but all I got was Harry Potter in Greek myth drag."
267,268,1,"The author takes Greek mythology and stomps on it. Why, Riordan? Why?! How is that Dionysus?! And Hermes! And even Poseidon--almost all of his children were monsters, not heroes...! Augh... There is something to be said for creative license, yes, but this book takes liberty too far."
268,269,1,"At first I really liked this series. But by the end I realized what a big waste of time it was. I know many people love it and would be offended by this, but compared to classic literature, it really doesn't stand a chance."
269,270,1,"I should be better about doing my homework before I read certain books. Never got into this at all, but only because I couldn't stand studying Greek mythology in Jr. High & have never liked it since. If I had, I probably would've loved this book more."
270,271,1,I wasn't a big fan of it at all I sort of think these books aren't that exciting but thats my opinion so thats my thought and I'm not really going to read another book like this inless it's on accident and I don't know what it is cause I'm not a big fan
271,272,1,"Couldn't get into it. The reading age was extremely low which made getting past the first chapter tedious.
However, i gave it to my little sister who hasn't read a book all the way through before. She's 13, and really enjoyed it and all of the references to Greek Mythology."
272,273,1,This was too young adult for my tastes. I was hoping for a good story and it started out interesting but then it just fell into silly road trips and cartoonish characters and left me feeling very old. I wont bother with the rest of this series.
273,274,1,"I saw this on TV and decided it was rather juvenile and I did not want to read it. I like the original, classic Ulysses story that it pretends to be much better. I can see that it might appeal to younger teen-age boys who read adventure stories, but not to me."
274,275,1,"Oh, probably work better for the age group it is written for than me. I thought the book was duller and more boring than the movie! Have the rest of the books as well, but guess it's gonna be a while before I read them."
275,276,1,"Hated this book. I thought the writing was poor, the plot was poor, the characters were underdeveloped... I disliked the morals that were introduced. Surely there has to be a better way to excite kids about Greek mythology. Little Merit."
276,277,1,Forced myself to read at least 100 pages before I quit. Didn't like it after first 20 and even less the farther I read. Quit before starting page 101. Do not understand all the rants and raves...awards and best books. Wasted 100 pages worth of my time...now on to something much better.
277,278,1,"Really didn't like this and was surprised. I'd heard good things from people who'd liked Harry Potter - but I found it to be trite, formulaic and overly self-absorbed. Too bad - I was ready for a good series."
278,279,1,"for anyone who thought the twilight series was bad... this... this, has got to be one of the most awful books ever written. words cannot express how bad this is. I won't bother with the rest of the books, like I did with the twilight series. what a waste of time!"
279,280,1,"Really glad I didn't buy this book because it wasn't that good. Maybe it's just that everything pales in comparison to Harry Potter. The general idea is good, but there was just some really bad writing at numerous points."
280,281,1,"Percy was not likeable! he tried to be cool and the book just overall bugged me! Rick Riordan is a horrible writer. Everyone is like ""Peter! You should read the lost hero or red pyramid!"" I just hate these show offy books. The movie made me hate the book even more than I already did."
281,282,1,"I could not even make myself finish this book. It was cheesy... too cheesy for me. Although, these types of books are not really something I would normally read. So if you don't like mythology books that have twists to them ect. don't read it."
282,283,1,"I have finally finished it!!

It was OK at the beginning, but got worse by every page. I didn't like or feel for the main characters, I hated the whole idea of the book. I thought it would be totally different.

The truth is, it's not even worth writing a review for!"
283,284,1,"Couldn't even finish it. I might try to read it again since everyone seems to love the books. Probably didn't help that I had just finished ""The Book Thief"" when I started this, which is an exceptional YA book."
284,285,1,"I read this book after i watched the movie. And im not into gods and goddesses and too much fantasies when it comes to reading. So, i got bored and read half of it. But, the movie was good. ;> another boy captivated my heart"
285,286,1,"I read this book on the advice of a friend, who admittedly, reads a lot of bad books. The characters are whiny, the writing is terrible, simple, and in some places wrong, and it's just overall a sad little book. Oh well. I'd have been better off reading Harry Potter again."
286,287,1,"Formulaic and tiresome. There really was nothing to attract me to this book. Admittedly I am very much older than the apparent intended audience age, but even taking that into account this seemed like a marketing/publisher-driven work designed to cash-in on the burgeoning YA sector."
287,288,1,"This book was beyond my 9 year old. Thank goodness, since I was slightly sickened of reading him bed time stories with evil spirits and powers. Not a very Christian story for his innocent heart and mind. We quit somewhere around page 50."
288,289,1,"Hmmm. A boy finds out he's magical, goes to a special school to hone his skills, and then sets out with his two friends (a super awesome girl and a comic relief boy) to defeat a dark overlord. Does any of this sound familiar? Luminos! Hopefully that will spark some original ideas."
289,290,1,I was quite disappointed it sounded really exciting but when I read it I just couldn't read the second it was just so boring and I love books that keep your eyes glued to the page and this definitely didn't have my eyes glued to the page.
290,291,1,"This book was decent and was okay as a time-killer. Recommend for people who have nothing to do with their time. This book was not as good as what people exaggerated it would be. I thought it had too much action and humor, and I didn't really get it."
291,292,1,"Why 1 star?

2 reasons:

1) I'm not a 14 year old. It is no longer easy for me to fall deeply into some fantasy world

2) UNORIGINAL. I've read and seen too many great books/stories that pre-date this one.

* I only read half of the book - reading on would hurt , so why waste more time."
292,293,1,I really did not enjoy this book because it made no sense and I think that if it was more fast passe especially in the beginning because for me I thought it was really slow so that's why I put it down to 1 star.
293,294,1,Read this when I was a college freshman. It felt like a chore. It just wasn't enjoyable at all. It bored the heck out of me and I couldn't pinpoint why. The world building just couldn't bring me into it. I wanted to like it so much but I simply couldn't. It's frustrating.
294,295,1,"This is a good adventure book, not as good as Harry Potter though. They have similar plot style but Harry Potter is more intriguing. Enough about comparing. Overall, this is a good book. I think kids would love it."
295,296,1,"Read the first 50 pages, and only one thought crossed through my mind - Just abandon this book.

This book was extremely irrelevant to me. :#


BTW, if you find my review offensive, then I am sorry. But I have my full rights to give any kind of review to a particular book. :)"
296,297,1,"Poorly written, poorly conceptualized, poorly executed. I am sorely disappointed that this has received the positive reviews and success it has. It speaks to our lack of respect and standard we have today for writing."
297,298,1,"The characters are stupid. The protagonist is annoying. His backstory is cliche as hell.

Also, while ""The Kronos Chronicles"" is not that great of a series either, it handles the whole what-if-pegan-gods-were-real idea in a much more creative way than ""The Olympians"" series does."
298,299,1,"This book had a nice topic but overall, was written horribly. The characters were very cheesy and literally made to be a popular teenagers biggest dream. At some points in the series I felt as though my heritage was being insulted."
299,300,1,"I hated this book, and I cannot fathom continuing to read more adventure of characters who are so unbelievable clueless and foolish. At least Hades isn't the ultimate bad guy in this story, as is too often the case."
300,301,1,"I definitely don't like Greek mythology. The whole time reading this book, I thought how two of my sons would enjoy it much more than me. We are reading it in class so I had to finish it. We spend way too much time butchering every paragraph. Yuck."
301,302,1,"I tried to like this one - or at least finish it, because it's a favourite of my 10 year old, but I couldn't do it. Stories about gods don't interest me, and I wasn't a fan of the writing style. I gave it a good effort."
302,303,1,"Characters are flat. The plot is needlessly complicated. The story world is unelaborated (except for the under world,) and the events are staged. This book does not respect the mind. Oh, did I mention that it blindly copies from Harry Potter?"
303,304,1,"DNF @ 40%

I don't get the glowing reviews for this book. The story was a snooze. The writing was TERRIBLE--""I went here. I ate this. I said X. I did Y. I saw Z."" There's no show, just 100% tell. Also, the narrator does not sound like a 12 year old."
304,305,1,"This book portrays a world where the Greek gods and hero's are real. That's the main reason I gave it a poor rating. However, if you want a fun way to teach your children about Greek mythology, this book is a great way to do it."
305,306,1,I think this book was very good the characters were great and the plot twist's were great as well. It also was a very long book which I like long story's. The book it self is really good because it was sad in some parts and some happy and exciting parts in the book.
306,307,1,"I honestly don't understand why anyone would give this book more than three stars. The writing was terrible, the dialogue was cringey, the world-building was non-existent, and the plot simultaneously dull and erratic."
307,308,1,"Our poor protagonist can't get a single question answered, despite worldly perils and loyal companions that provide him with little information, withheld for no reason at all. That's not cryptic, that's just annoying."
308,309,1,"I really wanted to like this book since so many of my students have read it/are reading it. But, I just couldn't do it. I should have abandoned it, but I made it too far I figured I should just push through."
309,310,1,"I bailed on this book about 1/3 of the way into it. It just didn’t capture my imagination the way other YA books have, I.e. Harry Potter. I decided to stop forcing my time on this book as it wasn’t offering anything in the form of entertainment or bettering myself."
310,311,1,"Frustratingly poorly written - great story line, compelling plot and characters with potential. This seemingly winning formula is destroyed by terrible application of written English and jarringly unimaginative dialogue. Read the original Greek myths with your kids instead."
311,312,1,"A mockery of the myths and just ridiculously lazy writing - especially for a kids book. Example: Earthquake decimated LA, everything burning, but they can somehow grab a supersonic flight to NYC? I mean, come on... give kids a little more credit than that."
312,313,1,"Hey, I'm not above reading juvenile fiction, and I love Greek mythology, so I should have been all over this one. But alas, it was not for me. It reminded me of Johnny Quest. Seems like it should be fun, but it's just a tedious slog."
313,314,1,"Efterlogg.

I've tried reading this before, and gave up after a few chapters. This time I read the whole damned thing and I still don't understand what the fuss is about. This... isn't funny? It's not interesting? It's bleak and boring and annoying."
314,315,1,"Meh. A FUCKTON of fatphobia plagues this book, as well as western exceptionalism which was super annoying. People kept hyping this book up as the woke alternative to Harry Potter but honestly? I wasn’t a fan of the anti-indigenous comments and the white-washing of history."
315,316,1,"I was hoping for a lighthearted and imaginative adventure of mediocre quality, and even at that I was a bit disappointed. The audience seems to be 10 and 11-yr olds rather than young adults, so maybe that's why it was such a miss."
316,317,1,"i don’t know why but i could never get behind the percy jackson series, even as an avid harry potter fan. i guess you’re either a percy jackson fan, a harry potter fan, or if you’re both- seek medical attention."
317,318,1,"DNF. I understand I’m not exactly the target audience for this series, but this felt obviously childish. Some children’s books still feel magical and any age can enjoy them for what they are. Percy Jackson isn’t one of them."
318,319,1,"I really wanted to like this; I even brought the entire series believing I would. But this was a hard one to get through. At times it felt rushed, at times painfully drawn out. I can see why they changed so much for the movie. Many I’m too old for it."
319,320,1,"The worst and most boring fiction book I’ve ever read, too much description, pointless dialogues, unrelated events. Honestly the only thing I liked reading was the Greek mythology parts, other than that the book is terrible"
320,321,1,The behavior and language of Percy is something I couldn’t stomach. It’s condoning his disrespectful nature. It details the abusive relationship he has with his step father. We returned the book. These are not appropriate for children.
321,322,1,"Joelle Reads Her Bucket List #3

Good freaking grief. Now I get why the movie was so incredibly stupid.

This is just about the most worthless, lamest, and idiotic bunch of trope I've made myself read since I survived the Harry Potter series last year.

Utter and complete trash.

The End."
322,323,1,"This book is absolute crap. I didn’t think it was a bad story, but it’s the more overrated thing I’ve ever seen. As I’m typing this, I’m sure there will be hundreds of crazy fan girls screaming at me in the comments. It had nothing to do with actual Greek mythology"
323,324,1,"Terrible. The author ripped a bunch of things from other books. It was difficult to get around that, especially in the beginning. It also would've been nice if he kept his politics out of it. This was a waste of time."
324,325,1,it was the worst book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't even think about commenting about my comment RYAN!
325,326,1,"readable, but just not that good in the end. clumsy and labored."
326,327,1,I don't really like the book it's just on of the books I have to do for summer reading.
327,328,1,I couldn't get through this book. It just felt like another one of those stupid fantasy books that people won't stop writing.
328,329,1,"I know this was the caudill for 2009 and everyone loved it, but im not a fantasy girl (unless it has to do with vampires!)"
329,330,1,Didn't engage my attention. It felt like a chore to continue reading.
330,331,1,"It is horrible, It disgusted me. So nasty.."
331,332,1,"chock full of page filling blither. modern day kid deals with Zeus, Ares, Poseidon, Persephone...in theme parks, fast food joints. It's a children's book that I wouldn't recommend."
332,333,1,Overrated.
333,334,1,the lightning thief by:shianne
334,335,1,"Fantasy books are hit or miss for me (ex. I don't like Harry Potter, but I love Lord of the Rings). Could barely get through this one. I can see why boys would like it though."
335,336,1,I had to give it to my 10 year old to read...don't know if I'll get it back...lol
336,337,1,
337,338,1,I only read about a third of this book. I didn't like the writing style and I didn't like the story.
338,339,1,i hated this book it was horriable i dont know How any one could read it!!!
339,340,1,Badly written and slow. Plus I didn't care much for the characters or plot. Blah.
340,341,1,All my students love this. I made it 30 pages and wanted to die.
341,342,1,"A mere shadow, poor rip off of Harry Potter."
342,343,1,I think that you should not read it because the story does not flow although the character are awesome
343,344,1,My students read this and recommended it to me. Anxious to get started.
344,345,1,"The mythological version of Harry Potter. Yes, it is a kid's book and it has action, but kids are smart enough to recognize formulas."
345,346,1,Cheesy.
346,347,1,couldn't get into this book.
347,348,1,"only got through the first few chapters. thought it was poorly written, and just couldn't get into it. written for a younger audience."
348,349,1,The tone and writing style in general was not very pretty and rather annoying at intervals. The twisted Greek Myth stuff was kinda fun and saved the book from being an utter wash.
349,350,1,"couldn't even finish it ... so much for ""the next harry potter""!"
350,351,1,"Made sense that it was turned into a movie because it read like a movie. Filled to the brim with action, but not too much substance."
351,352,1,This book was in my opinion not intended for anyone over the age of 12. The story was simple and the development of the story itself was amateurish.
352,353,1,What was i thinking?
353,354,1,movie was better dont read it
354,355,1,it was realy wierd to read dis book i only read the first page then i got board
355,356,1,I started reading this the other day and the writing was so juvenile! :( I was really looking forward to getting into a *series* of books again. I hope the Hunger Games will fulfill my needs!
356,357,1,Harry Potter ripoff.
357,358,1,Nothing special. In this case the movie was better.
358,359,1,Ehh. Not sure that I'll pick up the second one.
359,360,1,"Attempted to read this, was unable to. The plot seemed so poorly imagined, the writing wasn't great either. Might have been good for kids, though. Usually I enjoy the kids books."
360,361,1,Kinda boring if you ask me.
361,362,1,enjoyed the movie. hated the book. had to force myself to finish it.
362,363,1,don't waste your time on this
363,364,1,Didn't like the writing style. Liked the movie better.
364,365,1,"Was ok .. Liked the greek gods, got bored by 3rd book."
365,366,1,Too juvenile for my liking!
366,367,1,My brother got this book out from the library so he could read. I read the first few chapters and it was a terrible book! I hated it.
367,368,1,Couldn't get past the first chapter
368,369,1,It seemed like it was actually written by a sixth grader. Which maybe is harder to do for an author than I realize but it was annoying to read.
369,370,1,"Eh, I just didn't like it.

Found it predictable, couldn't relate to and didn't like the character of Percy at all and just couldn't get into it."
370,371,1,A fun book to read but the story get very predictable.
371,372,1,"Three reasons I didn't like this book
Reason 1: It didn't make me want to read
Reason 2: It was boring to me
Reason 3: I true it because I haven't read fatasy"
372,373,1,Might be the worst-written book I've read.
373,374,1,"Mildly interesting but clearly written for kids, not to my liking."
374,375,1,"the book is about a guy named percy that has to find and return zeus' master lightning bolt but to do that he has to stay alive from monsters, best, minotaurs, an a teacher bird monster thing."
375,376,1,i do not like this book. To be honest i think is boring. The book is about this Percy's mom who want to put him on a safety place. and Percy want to find out who his father is !
376,377,1,I did not like this book and will not continue reading the series.
377,378,1,i liked the moive better.
378,379,1,I did not finish reading this book ... don't understand how people can read this stuff!
379,380,1,"I honestly thought it was boring. I read it, but I diddn't really get into the concept of the whole story. I mean, I won't say it was a terrible book and I recommend it to anyone that likes reading."
380,381,1,"Shocking.

I thought the film was bloody awful but nothing quite prepared me for this bilgewater.

Avoid like the plague."
381,382,1,"I gave it a chance, but this is not a good book."
382,383,1,I personally did not enjoy The Lightning Thief. I felt it was poorly written.
383,384,1,"Maybe it was the audiobook version that I was ""reading,"" but this was just terrible."
384,385,1,"i just found the whole premise to be dull, i had really high hopes for this as ive heard its amazing :("
385,386,1,Meh
386,387,1,"I didn't even finish it though, l o l."
387,388,1,Just couldn't get into it enough to want to finish it.
388,389,1,"I kinda feel disappointed. The book is too young for me, no? All is too easy, too shallow, too one-dimensional. Hardly any surprise, not to mention the horribly simple writing."
389,390,1,I didn't finish it. The story was just so derivative and predictable on every level.
390,391,1,"""I'm going to write a book that blends fiction and mythology and a healthy dose of adolescent literature tropes,"" said Rick."
391,392,1,"This is more for just kids really, not really one of those ""for everyone"" books. The writing is very YA and the plot is very fast."
392,393,1,Ashley gave me this book to read... thank you Ashley.... I took me a while to get into it.. but I enjoyed it.... partly because I thought of Ashley reading it.
393,394,1,HATED IT IT SCARED ME TO DEATH WELL PRETTY MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 and i meant to put it in caps
394,395,1,Rick Riordan has the subtlety of a sledgehammer.
395,396,1,it wasn't what I expected
396,397,1,"Disgusting, I hate it. What's the point of the book?"
397,398,1,I stopped at chapter 3. Bleh.
398,399,1,I HATED THIS BOOK
399,400,1,My son made me read this. I was not a fan. Just didn't strike any chords with me.
400,401,1,"No character building, no pacing. It just felt like the whole thing was rushed."
401,402,1,This book was very much a children's book- with a fast (and very random) plot and absolutely no character development.
402,403,1,It is difficult to compete with the Harry Potter series.
403,404,1,"The plot is full of holes, and so is the world in which the story is set. Also, the main characters are terribly naive. The book is quite bad."
404,405,1,It was not good at all. I did not appeal to me at all
405,406,1,"I had a really hard time getting into this book. The story line is very slow, and seems pointless in some spots."
406,407,1,I couldn't stand this book. I tried but couldn't like it enough to even finish.
407,408,1,this book is cool I recommend every one to read
408,409,1,Was not that good the characters were going all over the place. You picture the wrong things when you read every word.
409,410,1,"i du know. 1.5, because i already knew most of the ending. I'll see how the second one goes. the 0.5 is out of pity, if i didn't already own the books i probably wouldn't have countined reading"
410,411,1,Started this book on the recommendation of my nephew. Read about half of it but just couldn't finish it.
411,412,1,This book sucks cant even read it
412,413,1,Recommended for younger readers...
413,414,1,"Was not a good book for me, being that I dislike Greek mythology."
414,415,1,A tiring read.... Would not recommend to any one for sure....
415,416,1,First book done in book-tube-athon! I did't really love this book but I do think it was written well and if I was younger I'd probably enjoy it more
416,417,1,An absolute joke to compare this to the legendary Harry Potter series.
417,418,1,good if you're an 8 year kid that's just learning to read
418,419,1,How do you start reading a book not Ebooks but just a regular one
419,420,1,"A little too kid for me. I was on a YA kick but this one did not read like a Hunger Games book. Enjoyed the Greek myth, but that was about all. Will not be reading the sequels"
420,421,1,"It lost me multiple times, it wasnt my kind"
421,422,1,I just couldn't enjoy it. Maybe it is better for a younger audience. *shrug
422,423,1,"The Lightning Thief was a long and boring starter book. It took too long to get into it. For me when it's hard to finish, you know it's not good. This was one of those books."
423,424,1,I read 3 pages and couldn't take any more. The kid (narrator) was just too much.
424,425,1,I do NOT recommend this book it is NOT good. I rest my case
425,426,1,I REALLY don't like this book. It was so hard to get into and it was just boring. I'm sorry if you like it but I think it's really awful. :(
426,427,1,I attempted reading this and it just was so boring! The characters were sooo unrealistic and difficult to picture
427,428,1,"I did not like this. It was so weird and just stupid. I'm sorry, but I don't recommend reading this."
428,429,1,"Let us be clear about this, this story is awful. I don't know why people like it but it's terrible. Badly written and disappointing I present to you the lightning thief."
429,430,1,"The story runs on pure stupidity.
I hate that the main characters tends to do actions very stupidly."
430,431,1,"okay, sorry to all of the Percy Jackson fans out there. But i DID NOT like this book or series at all. WAY TO CONFUSING AND TO MANY CHARACTERS."
431,432,1,"I felt the writing to be a little too middle grade for my taste, so I did not finish it."
432,433,1,I didn't really like it. It wasn't really that interesting.
433,434,1,"Didn't finish... Very dark and kind of disturbing how angry this poor kid was. In fact, it was making me angry just reading it."
434,435,1,this book bored me so much that I wasn't even willing to finish the book.
435,436,1,"Did not finish- I wanted to like it- too ""young adult""-ish."
436,437,1,"i didn't like this book it was boring because it is my opinion
i think this book can be recommended for like reader that like fantasy"
437,438,1,its not the best book ive read in my life
438,439,1,"I read it, I don't care for it, I am not continuing the series. The book was really confusing and I have like absolutely no thoughts for liking it."
439,440,1,Protagonist is an asshole and the writing is clearly not meant for readers who've reached puberty.
440,441,1,I feel like I was probably too old for this when I read it.
441,442,1,made it a little over halfway before quitting - couldn't get over the cheese factor of the writing
442,443,1,Non starter really. Not for me.
443,444,1,"I like children's books, but this was boiled down too simplistically. The story was just being told to me, and I like engaging storytelling that surrounds me instead of just talking at me."
444,445,1,"It's like Harry Potter, but then boring"
445,446,1,Was boring and hard to get through
446,447,1,"I was portrayed very unfairly in this book. Sad to say I won't be continuing the series. Get your facts straight, Riordan."
447,448,1,I can't understand how 14+ year olds can enjoy this incredibly childish book
448,449,1,"I thought I would like this book because my friend told me it was good. It was very poorly written, it had weak character and plot development, and it to quickly moving."
449,450,1,
450,451,1,Nope.
451,452,1,*NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S MOVIE*
452,453,1,Good
453,454,1,I did not finish this book. I found Percy as a narrator to be very annoying. The book's insistence on worshipping the Greek gods was...unsettling.
454,455,1,All I have to say is if I could I would give this a 0.
455,456,1,"It's just bad. It's middle grade fiction, maybe that's why?!"
456,457,1,"I really wanted to like this book as it has been recommended to me by so many people, but was disappointed by the simplistic writing style and the formulaic characters."
457,458,1,it was hard to get into this book
458,459,1,This book blows. The movie was much better. I read it in 7th grade and still remember how boring it was.
459,460,1,Page 2 was very tasty!
460,461,1,
461,462,1,"I found this book to be entertaining, but it was a little fluffy, would have loved a slower pace to develop some atmosphere, a little more description, etc!"
462,463,1,The book was alright not the best but pretty good because the adventures and the characters
463,464,1,wtf is this.. how pathetic to try copying Harry Potter and how miserably it failed. Just wtf
464,465,1,
465,466,1,i did not like this book that much.
466,467,1,I put this book down about 10% of the way in. The author lacks subtlety and the main character is weak and oblivious.
467,468,1,"I just could not buy into this one. Unlikable characters and very dull writing. I can usually live with one or the other, but not both."
468,469,1,I had tried to read this so many times and could never get past page 100
469,470,1,boring and not fun to read at all. this book is very bad
470,471,1,"Jesus Christ, I didn't know someone could write up a book with this racist of a main character and get away with it. How did he get away with this? How does no one notice this?"
471,472,1,I didnt really like it as much.
472,473,1,"I hate this book. It has a difficult story line to follow and it just feels very done before. I found it boring and typical, I wouldn’t recommend it."
473,474,1,"It was horrible, I could not even get to the second book, it was very far fetched!"
474,475,1,"Only includes Greek gods, no Christian gods."
475,476,1,Very childish... maybe would have liked it if I read it 18 years ago.. :( DNF
476,477,1,Crap
477,478,1,"Terrible book. Can I rate something negative stars?

I mean seriously.

This book sucks, for reasons I just lengthily typed on the PJO haters strand and will not type again."
478,479,1,Rick Riordan should not continue to be an author. I could barely get through this book
479,480,1,I personally didnt like it very much. Hopefully the actual books will be better.
480,481,1,A story that is not for me.
481,482,1,and I oop-
482,483,1,not to good
483,484,1,Look at my review on book 5 for my full view.
484,485,1,Yuck. Read only because three of my kids love these books and they peer-pressured me.
485,486,1,I don't really like it
486,487,1,a good book for young readers. uses a LOT of foreshadowing.
487,488,1,This is one of those overrated books I've ever read.The whole plot is so stupid.There's absolutely no logic in this whatsoever.And there wasn't a single character I found interesting.
488,489,1,no❤️
489,490,1,the only saving grace was that its a short book.
490,491,1,I... I do not know what to write exactly. The book is a bad harry potter copy/fan fiction. How on earth this has become a bestseller?
491,492,1,This entire series was a disappointment. The narrator was awful and made the story worse than it already was.
492,493,1,This book was awesome! I loved it!
493,494,1,It was alright. Grateful that I've read it but honestly don't see the hype. Ranger's Apprentice by John Flanagan has a much better start and stays consistent throughout.
494,495,1,"Dnfed!!!
Ik a lot of readers suggested me this and I really wanted to love it...but...uggghhhh...I didn't hit well with this world..."
495,496,1,
496,497,1,I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK
497,498,1,Definitely imaginative but not my speed. I did not enjoy any of it.
498,499,1,"Okay for western, Christian 6-10 year olds.

Other children's books will impart better messages and probably make a better stab at being accurate to the mythology it's trying to draw on."
499,500,1,
500,501,1,It was kind of strange and the ending sucked
501,502,1,.
502,503,1,No read
503,504,1,
504,505,1,Not my jam. DNF
505,506,1,"Absolutely hated this. Not a fan of Percy… kinda annoying. But to be fair, I don’t like Greek Mythology."
506,507,1,this book suck sorry
507,508,1,DNF. Annoying with bad narration
508,509,1,I didn’t like it
509,510,1,please don't yell at me for my one-star rating I know I'm in the minority here
510,511,1,"New York
Greek mythology
Ancient Being
Water
Blue
The muses"
511,512,1,"Read this for Ellie, but it's just not my jam. Very conversational writing style, predictable 'twists,' and shallow."
512,513,1,How do i read the book?
513,514,1,DNF at 25%
514,515,1,I am decidedly not the target audience for this book.
515,516,1,it was enticing. idk why my cousin who likes the same genres as me didn't enjoy them. they gave me the entire series their friend gave them because of their disliking.
516,517,1,i ddint read this but it looks bad
517,518,1,"Simple writing, cliched and nepotistic character traits, over the top villains encounters,"
518,519,1,"Maybe there's something I'm missing or something wrong with me, but this might be the worst children's book I have read in a long time."
519,520,1,Terrible.
520,521,1,“The dead aren’t scary. They’re just sad”
521,522,1,Bad never reading another got gifted the hardcover box set and gave it away FOR FREE
522,523,1,(dnf @ like 60%) i feel like i just read a completely different book to everyone else …
523,524,1,I can't seem to read the books even though they are in the my books column...I'd like to know how to read the books pls..... HELP
524,525,1,I never read this when I was younger so I thought I'd give it a shot. I got like halfway through but I had to stop because it was making me hate greek mythology.
525,526,1,I hated this so much. It took me an embarrassingly long time to finish because I loathed it so much that I couldn’t power through.
526,527,1,Trash
527,528,1,In my opinion this book was really boring and it was really hard to keep reading but I pushed through and hated.
528,529,1,A bunch of rubbish! I couldn’t force myself to even finish it.
529,530,1,Really felt like a 12 year old WROTE this book.
530,531,1,"I've read the whole series, so I'm talking about every book in this.
WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR MEN TO WRITE GREEK GODDESSES?"
531,532,1,I did not like it. It was confusing and the story line made no sense it was that good at all.
532,533,1,This is my 13th reason
533,534,1,I couldn’t do it. Got about 50% of the way through but I just really don’t care for mythology in any form.
534,535,1,worst book ever apsolutely no theme or plot at all
535,536,1,"i cannot enjoy a book when i dislike the main character. percy drove me nuts, couldn’t stand him the entire time. overrated as hellllll"
536,537,1,"I read it when i was an adult, so it felt too much like reading a kids book without the nostalgia."
537,538,1,No thank you
538,539,1,"I know that each book is different and has its own audience, but I couldn't help comparing it to the Harry Potter series, so maybe that has affected my opinion of the book a lot. Warning: might contain spoilers, also apologies to the fans. Anyway, here is what I think:
1. This felt more like a collection of greek mythology stories all dumped into one book. The book doesn't seem to follow one specific plot. There is a quest to be done and understood, but it's revealed almost halfway through the book. Each time Percy kills or escapes some creature, it's like that alone could've been a quest on its own, but they are described as some mini-games he needs to pass in order to get to the main boss. Of course, a hero is expected to face obstacles on his way but usually, each of those would lead to them discovering some part of a bigger plan or goal, in this story, however, the obstacles are sort of random and have no deeper meaning behind them.
2. Another thing is the characters. Literally the whole universe revolves around Percy, as it should be, but seriously, Percy seems to be doing perfectly fine on his own. Seeing as Annabeth and Grover are with him on this quest, some more credit could've been given to them. Like, Annabeth is supposed to be ""the wise one"" but I saw Percy show way more wisdom than her. It made me think of how in HP Hermione is the smart one and you can actually see that from her actions and contribution to the trio's success.
3. Percy tends to discover more and more of his abilities at the most convenient times, like always. It really feels like the author creates some trouble and only then makes up a new ability for Percy to help him overcome it. Not to be a jerk but again, in HP, Harry had his abilities discovered at, possibly, the LEAST convenient times (like discovering his magic while living with Dursleys or Parseltongue in front of the whole school, making him appear like the bad guy)."
539,540,1,"Percy Jackson e o Ladrão de Raios ou Como Escrever um Block-Buster com a receita pessoal de JK Rowling!

Na indústria dos livros há dois tipos de abordagem quando uma série faz sucesso estrondoso: se contrata um ghostwriter para que ele crie mais obras com o nome do autor original ou se usa a fórmula já comprovada para atrair aqueles que gostam de mais do mesmo.

Foi assim que Rick Riordan, um escritor no máximo razoável, usando os pontos principais que tecem a trama de Harry Potter, criou o personagem Percy Jackson numa tentativa de dar uma roupagem estadunidense a uma trama de renome internacional.

Percy tem uma personalidade desequilibrada que não compete com a de um garoto de 12 - 13 anos. Seus amigos são igualmente estranhos e obtusos e apenas trocaram de roupagem para não receberem os nomes de Rony e Hermione.

Mesmo os professores, com quem ele tem contato no Acampamento de Meio-Sangues, uma espécie de Hogwarts de Verão, são opacos e praticamente desligados da trama. O autor não consegue conciliá-los com a noção aventureira da série e a idade de Percy, e por isso se tem a impressão que eles sabem o que está acontecendo, mas são incapazes de fazer algo.

Fica difícil de engolir que deuses e centauros de milênios de idade podem ser superados por um garoto de 12 anos, ainda que um semideus.

E esse talvez seja o maior ponto fraco da série, a roupagem mitológica. Para os entendidos, tudo fica previsível demais, para quem não conhece, é muito confuso e as referências não-explicadas - teoricamente subentendidas - podem desmotivar os leitores mais novos.

A linguagem e a escrita, contudo, são bem dinâmicas e por serem simples facilitam a leitura. Talvez não seja a melhor escolha para o seu pimpolho, mas em tempos de rede social... talvez não seja a pior."
540,541,1,"They say you can read “100-minus-your-age” pages to assess a book’s value. After 64 pages, I had no trouble making a call on Percy Jackson.

Our narrator and “hero,” young Percy, is an underdog, a troubled kid from a messy home who hasn’t managed to succeed yet anywhere in his young life. So far, so good. An underdog hero can be the best sort. But Percy’s attitude is calloused and sarcastic, disrespectful in his narration even as he paints himself as a kid who’s trying to be good and stay out of trouble. Rather than earning his readers’ affection, he demands it.

The writing is mediocre, almost what you’d expect to hear conversationally from a twelve-year-old boy: everything with a tinge of smirking. I suppose this is precisely what makes the book appeal to twelve-year-olds, but it’s not the voice I want my child absorbing. The potty humor, or just shy of it, sours the story even further. Chapter 3 is titled “Grover Unexpectedly Loses His Pants” and Chapter 6 is called “I Become Supreme Lord of the Bathroom.” And those are just chapter titles.

The plot in Percy Jackson is compelling. Were it done well, it could be a wonderful introduction to Greek mythological characters, an effective rags to riches story of a boy who thought he was a nobody coming to grips with his deep significance. Instead, it’s a weak imitation of a true hero story told in language meant to appeal to the masses and, frankly, likely to keep them interested in only the base forms of literature.

For a beautiful story that does all this stuff right, try Mio, My Son or Winterhouse."
541,542,1,"Maybe my expectations were too high from all the hype, but it was really difficult to finish this one.

It was a cool idea, but read like a NaNoWriMo HP fanfic on its second rewrite. I'm glad the kids like it, but I just can't.

I couldn't help going into editing mode. I want to slash and reorg so much of this book - especially the opening chapters. The middle sagged and characters didn't seem to step into their power (or indeed change in any meaningful way at all). The ending was drawn out and boring.

I could forgive the overly obvious foreshadowing, clumsy wording, lack of descriptions, and maybe even all the telling that should have been showing as YA or first book issues, BUT I just could NOT get over all the blatant contradictions.

Someone really needed to read this book specifically to check for consistency in events and logic (e.g. the bag of coins they got from one person but then later it's said to be from someone else).

Also, I'll accept a 2D character where it makes sense, but there was NO logic of consistency in character motivations either. And the mom and step dad are just... I just can't even get started. Especially to end with mom... Wow. Great message on morality there. And to have a ""protector"" that's totally useless and needs your protection?!?

Okay, I just need to walk away now.

Needless to say, I won't be finishing the series after all."
542,543,1,"Rick Riordan isn't the best writer, but let's be honest. Camp Half-Blood deserves better. Percy is just unbelievably stupid, and should be put into Juvie, not going to some private school. Percy's mother doesn't have any character growth! She stays the exact same, throughout the little parts she's in, even though she was trapped in the underworld for like 2 months!!! That would change a person, but nooo, not for Rick. You wouldn't find any of these characters in real life, human, demigod, satyr, or not, you wouldn't find these personalities in the real world. The gods are supposed to be all powerful, and all knowing, but they couldn't figure out who took the lightning bolt, and how it was taken. Gods and can't take anything from other gods, so there wasn't really a plot twist when they figured out that it wasn't Percy who took the bolt. They also, for how powerful they're supposed to be, couldn't kill one 12 year-old boy. The only reason this book was fun to read, was to imagine what if I was a demigod, what if I went to camp half-blood, what if I went on this quest. The book itself was just predictable, even a 10 year old kid could figure out what the main character should do before the main character does."
543,544,1,
544,545,1,"I wanted to like this book so bad. But I read it, and it was just... bad. I'm sorry to all the Percy Jackson fans out there, but I seriously regret reading it. First of all, the writing was just horrendous. It sounded like a nine-year-old wrote it. Predictable and boring. A boy that's ""different from everyone"" and just can't seem to fit it. Then, it's revealed that he's not actually a human (didn't see that coming...). Sounds familiar, no? Oh, yes, it's Harry Potter but poorly put together. And don't get me started on the characters. The heroic teenager, the love interest, and the quirky best friend. Let's start with Percy. He doesn't have any... well, feelings. His mom dies in front of him, but who cares? Not Percy, that's for sure! He has to go on a deadly quest! But he doesn't care about that either... Then there's Annabeth, who has no other purpose than to be Percy's girlfriend. Riordan tries to make her some inspiring female character, but he fails. Immensely. Then, Grover. Sweet, sweet Grover. He doesn't matter at all. He exists solely for more bodies in the story. Overall, Percy Jackson is not something I would ever really want to think about again."
545,546,1,"I hated this book. We had to read this book for English so it got boring quickly, I feel like if we didn't have to read it for English I would have read it on my own and liked it. There were too many unnecessary details and, this is my opinion, but I don't like fantasy books that much and I especially don't like Greek Mythology books. There are definitely better books than this and you could never pay me enough money to read this book again or to finish the book series. Everyone is like "" OMG Annabeth and Percy"" like no... just no. This book is a harry potter wannabe, I can go on and on about the similarities and how this book is such a wannabe. Another thing I hate is people simping over Percy Jackson like ""I love him so much he is like my fictional crush"" I get that most of us bookworms have fictiophilia like, but PERCY JACKSON IS DEFINITELY NOT ALL THAT! Anyway, in conclusion, this book sucked, don't read if you want to be disappointed thank you!<3"
546,547,1,"Ammetto di essermi imbarcata in questa breve avventura (è un libro che si legge in un paio di serate) per motivi di lavoro: nel turismo pare che Percy Jackson sia il fenomeno del momento e che molti ragazzini americani ne vadano pazzi.
E' la classica storia che già riesci ad indovinare dalle prime pagine. Una trama che sembra il riassunto breve di Harry Potter, dove i personaggi sono gli stessi (il prescelto, l'amica secchione e l'altro amico brutto ma buono), ci sono dei mostri che vogliono distruggere il mondo e l'Eroe, poteri sovrannaturali che il protagonista scopre man mano, sogni premonitori, la scuola che lo chiama e lui che torna a casa ad anno finito, insomma gli stessi ingredienti ma conditi di mitologia greca e sintetizzati al massimo.
Se questa è la nuova letteratura per ragazzi stiamo messi male davvero, lo trovo un insulto alla loro intelligenza"
547,548,1,"Not a fan. If you read this review you may not be a fan of me.

It's pretty obvious the writer is a New England man at heart. Not only does he use words and phrases common to the NE area he also writes about a young man, who has no idea you SHOULDN'T HIT A WOMAN. I can't believe this guy grew up in Texas!

Did you miss that part? I didn't. It's a common New England characteristic for men to want to and be allowed to strike women.

The author downplays it because the protagonist is young oh and he had a right to because that's how an uncivilized person acts when faced with issues.

Go back, reread this, and count how many times Percy mentions, thinks,or follows through physically harming a girl."

en serio este libro está lleno de clichés, y de onomatopeyas osea un niño no es capaz de imaginar como bala una cabra, osea nunca escucho ese sonido, y encima los típicos clichés de libros de niños, la tía que es la bruja mala, y que podemos destruir, si muy a lo cuentos de los hermanos grim.

hey está bien que los dioses estén en todos lados pero en serio vivir en NY en el piso 600 allí está el Olimpo, si creanme eso fue lo que mas me dolió, lo lindo de las series, sagas o lo que sea ue tome la mitologia griega es el Olimpo está en el monte Olimpo, que lls dioses van y viene en el mundo a su antojo peor el Olimpo no se mueve de su sitio.

leer el libro no fue una tortura, más bien me daba una pereza que esa si fue mundial, no se si seguiré la serie"

599,600,1,"I am not one for myths being present in the modern day, so I am biased in that regard. However, while I would say that it had great potential for a creative and well-developed portrayal of how the ""worlds"" could possibly co-exist without knowing of each other. I don't think it did that.

The main plot in concept is intriguing, in execution, however, it felt more like the author didn't know how to get the characters from the beginning of the book to the end. As it is, the book is very average and is definitely very 2000sish.

Finally, I find the main character to be, truly, an insufferable character. I am not sure if that is what was intended but if it was, I must congratulate the author on making a protagonist so unlikable that you almost forget he is supposed to be the one to succeed in the end. Overall, if I were to describe this book to anyone, I would call it ""a mean-spirited book""."
600,601,1,"it's an ok story for kids and i was really just reading this as a primer for greek history since i never read it as a child but there is quite a lot of american centric and us/western imperialism in the book even though it's all mentioned off-handedly. lots of uncritical praise for the west rubs me wrong.

really uncomfortable with the amount of commercialism and literal consumerism (namedropping brands - it really dates books) and the attempt to mythologize real historical figures as past demigods feels incredibly inappropriate.

aside from these issues, the book is a fine middle-grade read."
601,602,1,"I didn't like it.
I don't know why people make it out to be an amazing book. It's, to be completely honest, boring.
The book drones on and on about the same old things. It's Percy that Percy this and I didn't understand, anyway.
I only made it half in before I gave up, deleted the ebook from my laptop and downloaded a much more worthy, more interesting book. That book, in fact, is One Of Us Is Lying. Please check that out. It's amazing.
So what can I say about this? If you are searching for a Harry Potter similar book, don't try this one. There are many books out there that are pretty similar to HP, if that's what you're looking for.
Thank you!"
602,603,1,"Da questo libro nutrivo grandi aspettative. Mi ha incredibilmente delusa. Tratta i personaggi in modo superficiale e infantile. La trama non è poi così male, ma gli avvenimenti che accadono nel mentre sono a dir poco imbarazzanti. Per non parlare di come la mitologia greca, che è a base praticamente della letteratura e della cultura occidentale, viene trattata e rovinata. Per un bambino questo libro può essere carino, ma dato che me l'avevano consigliato anche persone adulte, l'ho valutato con occhi oggettivi."

0,1,2,"I knew almost nothing about Greek and Roman mythologies prior to reading this book. So, while reading the first two chapters and when I had difficulty following what's going on, particularly who were those characters, I picked up and started reading Edith Hamilton’s Mythology. After finishing the first chapter of that book, I resumed my reading and then I could follow.

The reason for my ignorance was that my teachers in elementary, high school and college did not bother teaching about those gods and goddesses. When people say “god,” for me it should be one of the three persons of one God: the father, the son or the holy spirit. Although, of course, mostly it is the son or the father and rarely the holy spirit). Virgin Mary nor any of the female saints has never been referred to as a goddess. Growing up, when a woman is referred to as a goddess, she must be a fox and not something that can move mountains or create a storm.

Okay. Okay. I had some sketchy knowledge about Mercury, Mars, Venus (the Romans and not the planets, silly!) from the that I used to read as a kid but I did not think that those had Greek equivalents who were created or made popular by Homer (around 850 B.C.) who wrote the , an epic poem about the Trojan War and is among the oldest extant works in Western literature. So, here I am saying hello to: (one of the Titans) who had three children: (ruler of the heaven), (ruler of the sea) and (ruler of the underworld). The three children seem to be evil that they “killed” their father and pound them into pieces. However, Kronus as the father of Gods cannot be killed so he is just there somewhere beneath the earth and he is making himself felt and I think he is like Voldermort in Harry Potter who will be the ultimate villain in the end of this series ha ha.

With the looks of it, Texan guy Rick Rioldan (born June 5, 1964 – ) cleverly used this portion of the Greek mythology and make us believe that Mt. Olympus which is where the 12 Olympians (3 of those I mentioned) reside, is on the 600th floor of Empire State Building in New York and the underworld where Hades stays is in Hollywood in Los Angeles! Good thinking for a guy as old as I ha ha. Two target (captured) markets: the old ones who love reading books about Greek mythology and the young ones who love adventures set in American soil. Clever guy. He is a graduate of University of Texas at Austin in 1986 where in double-majored in English and thought English history including Greek mythology (that’s why he knows his stuff oh so thoroughly). He got his first Master Teacher Award in 2002. So, the guy is not just an ordinary mortal like us, he is a model teacher!

The story revolves around a 12-y/o boy who is a demigod (son of Poseidon) with ADHD and dyslexia. He helps in finding the missing master bolt of his uncle Zeus to prevent the war between the two gods. In his quest, he is helped by , a satyr and also a demigod as she is the daughter of , the daughter of Zeus. Sorry, for lovers of romance, there is no love angle to the story because Athena is Percy’s (or Perseus, his Christian err Greek name) first cousin. The plot is ordinary but teacher Rioldan made sure that he followed the formula for YA: interesting characters, build the climax, throw in the mystery of Oracle, unstoppable action, one conflict after another up to the point of almost losing the quest, then suddenly there goes the resolution and then explain, explain, make the readers believe that everything still makes sense, then as this is a series, hang some stuffs unresolved, and oh the second book oh, put the first chapter of the second book to tease them to read it too.

Everything is in order: Flawless in following the formula to the letter. Witty and funny lines. Brilliant boundless imagination. I just cannot find fault about this book.

And oh, for those who did not like this book because they felt too old for this kind of story? Why did you pick it up in the first place? Aren't the cover and the blurbs obvious?"
1,2,2,"This book was released when I was about 16 or 17 years old, and at that point I loved Harry Potter (still do) but had moved on to adult literature. Like Middlesex and Brave New World and such. I was not going to read children's books anymore (god I was a book snob). So basically I missed out on the whole Percy Jackson obsession.

Anyways, I won't rehash the plot. I was honestly bored while reading this, and the flow of the book didn't work for me. It was like it had ADD or something. Every time the characters would try to accomplish something, something bigger happened right away. And I know that's the point, but I found it really annoying that they got attacked every 2 hours or something. It was all over the place.

I can see the appeal this holds to younger children and tweens, but I guess as an adult, this book just didn't work for me.

Via the Goodreads rating system I am rating this a 2 because ""it was okay"". I did not enjoy this book but I did not hate it."
2,3,2,"*boards up windows and doors*
Sooooooooooooo.. I'mdnfingthisat45%. *hides*

It's just not my thing. I'm keeping this sweet because this book is close to my dear friend Francesca's heart (Dear Lord, please don't let her see this) but I really didn't like this. I really really wanted to and was excited about it, but I didn't. I tell myself that it's not the book, it's me. That I'm too old for it, that it's not my fandom (I gave my heart to the boy in the cupboard under the stairs a long time ago) but honestly.. I think it's the book a little bit too. I absolutely ADORE , it's one of my all time favorites, which is also a middle grade but it's written SO much better than this. The first Harry Potters are aimed at a younger audience as well, and the fact that I grew up with it probably plays a huge roll in my thinking, but it's also written so much better than this is. The writing was so simple that it was hard for me to read and a little laughable. I tried to keep in mind that it's for a younger audience, that the characters age but I just couldn't do it.

I liked the mythology, but I could care less about the camp (I can't even remember the name) and just kept comparing everything to HP. I couldn't stop. Maybe if I hadn't seen the movie and didn't already know the end I would have found the plot more interesting but.. I knew the end and didn't find the plot interesting SOOOO.

Percy and his friends were fine. There were nothing special about them that really stood out to me. I didn't dislike them and I didn't like them. They were just meh.

So. Yep. Not my fandom. Not the book for me."
3,4,2,"2.5 stars Porbably would've lied it more have I read it when I was a kid for the first time. Reading this one as a grown up doesn't do it for me. I liked the Greek mythology in ti of course and think that it's simplistic enough for the younger audince to understand it and be interested in it, but also intricate enough for the adults to nod at the references as well. But at the same time, I didn't like - at all - that every freaking Greek god wanted to be only in North America. The freaking Olymp was ste in America. Are you kidding me with this?! Greek god's would obviously reside in - guess where! - Greece. They could be traveling all over the world of course, including America, but why the heck would ALL of them live there of all places? They have NO history there. That kind of thing seemed way too americanized for my taste. I also feel like Riordan inspired A LOT in Harry Potter. And even readers who love this series should well see that.

**************************************





Amazing start to the beloved Percy Jackson series! First of all, I absolutely love Greek mythology and Rick Riordan did it very well, so that even if you don't know these myths, you won't be confused at all.
I'm sure that Percy is very relatable hero for younger audience, Annabeth is just the kind of heroine I adore and all the characters are really cute!
Riordan's writing is fast, simple and enjoyable. All his characters are interesting and relatable to young readers. And I absolutely love how he blended mythology with real world - Even though, I don't get why would be Olymp and Greek gods in America. Shouldn't they live in Greece?!
I would - of course - like The Lightning Thief more when I was younger and sometimes, it reminded me too much of Harry Potter (Yes, I compared these two. And I'm definitely biased, because Harry Potter is my ultimate favourite series of all time. Duh.)






For me, some things were really good and some not so much - repetitive plot twists, little bit boring toward the middle of the book.
Overall, it was fun, fast and addictive MG read. I enjoyed the mythology, characters and their witty dialogues. And can't wait to read the rest of the series soon!"
4,5,2,"This is a sheer rip-off of Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

While Rowling's work is impressive and detailed, Riordan's work is a pure copy of hers.

Half-blood boy destined to save the world. Sound familiar?"
5,6,2,"...well, that was...interesting.

I honestly feel slightly bad for rating this so low since so many people I know love it, but it just made me squirm while I was reading it.

I love the way some authors weave mythology into their stories, like N.D. Wilson and Kyle Robert Shultz. Mythology is cool! So many fascinating creatures and places sprung from the imaginative minds of those who created mythology and legends. But the themes of the original myths? Not so great. Greek mythology, to me, displays the depravity of humanity, and I hate reading those stories. It’s important to understand the baseness of humanity to understand the grace of God, but Greek stories are just depraved.

And yes, I knew that this series was full of mythology before I read it. But I held out hope that there would be some redeeming qualities to it. Unfortunately, I found that it was infused with the same humanism and childish cosmic fits as the original myths.

It’s not the “mythology,” exactly, that bothers me about this story; it’s the themes. It was interesting how at one point, Chiron hinted that God did exist in addition to the Greek gods. But the way the whole system was set up...there’s no way Yahweh could exist. Greek mythology is full of humanism and hopelessness, and it makes me feel sick to think of living in a world like that. How can people live with no hope? The gods are capricious, immoral, and manipulative; it’s quite obvious that they were created in humans’ own image. Since the gods set such a horrible example for humans, it’s no wonder that humans abandon true morality when they follow that system. These childish, glorified humans with superpowers whose temper tantrums cause world wars are not people who deserve homage.

The “good” in the story seems really pointless based on the arbitrary morals presented. If God doesn’t have an active role in the world, then what is good? What is evil? The fates of those in the underworld cast a hopeless, meaningless gloom over the story. Over life. Doing “good,” then, is...what? Something that will get you into Elysium? Which is doing stuff and desperately hoping that it’s enough? There’s no moral foundation to say what’s good and what’s evil.

Additionally, the whole thing with gods running around infatuated, having affairs and having kids all over the place, just...gives me a sick, yucky feeling. I know that’s a big part of the Greek myths, but of course that does not at all make it okay. *shudders* Ugh. I hate stories where people don’t truly value marriage/true love/relationships, just the cheap thrills they can get from casually playing around.

All that said, does have fun parts to it. The perspective is realistic for a twelve-year-old; Percy is a great narrator. Good foreshadowing and snarky/sarcastic humor compose a well-structured novel. I like the theme of friendship and teamwork as Percy, Annabeth, and Grover persevere on their mission. And the chapter titles are hilarious (they remind me a little of the chapter titles from the Afterverse books).

Now, I don’t think reading this series will cause kids to do anything so drastic as to start worshiping the Greek gods, but I personally do not recommend this book. I know I’m reading a lot into this; it is a MG series. But I just didn’t feel okay with it.

It’s possible that I may read the rest of the series at some point in the future since the story is interesting, but I didn’t enjoy this first book very much.

Content: mild violence, Greek mythology (obviously), many references to affairs/extramarital relationships between gods and between humans and gods"
6,7,2,"No.

Writing for children is not easy. It's not something you do if you can't write for adults. Children are not stupid, they are people in development. Because of that, every author that specialises in child literature has a responsibility, and I'm not talking about the story told, but how it is told. If they read half-sentences, they will think half-thoughts. If they are not challenged to think, their brains won't challenge themselves.

That said, this is not a book for children this is just a badly written book. Author is chewing on someone else's world and not bringing in much new. And being predictable predictable predictable.

P.S.
The only thing America is the center of is mass market production."
7,8,2,"The observation is hackneyed by this point, but the book just screams 'Harry Potter' knockoff from page one on and very rarely lets up.

The writing is pretty good. The story is adequate, although the big twists are pretty well obvious and the author does little to conceal them. The author is particularly good with action scenes and wisely decides to stick to what he does well. The attempts at witty, angsty teenage banter often seem forced and clichéd. One of the biggest virtues of the book is that it is short and doesn't drag.

Compared to the first book of the Harry Potter series, I was much less bored by 'The Lightning Thief'. But on the other hand, I was at the end a lot less satisfied. I found 'The Sorcerer's Stone' to be dull and drag and was on the verge of giving it up several times, but Rawling's excellent story telling skills made for an ending that was sufficiently dramatic and unexpected that I was willing to give the second book a go. Likewise, the Harry Potter stories are infused with a deeply thoughtful morality and occasional flashes of brilliance that made them more than simply good kid's fare. I rarely got the same feeling from 'The Lightning Thief' and was left with little to chew on or anticipate, so it seems unlikely that I'll follow Percy Jackson's story further any time soon.

I also got the feeling that this book simply couldn't have been written without Harry Potter as a template.

One concern about this book is that I can't figure out really what age of reader is appropriate for it. The book deals with a lot of tough mature themes which I'm not sure I'd consider appropriate reading for a 12 year old, but the language seems more geared to 6th graders. My guess is that by far the biggest audience for the book is adult readers of Harry Potter. While the substance of the book is perfectly appropriate given its genesis in the wildly amoral Greek myths, it stands in marked contrast to the sensitivity of the Harry Potter series which successfully matured its characterization of evil to match the maturity of a reader of roughly the same age as the main character.

Besides all that, my single biggest complaint though is a nerdy one. In the book, several characters are said to be the children of Athena. Athena however was a fiercely virginal goddess both by oath and inclination and it’s completely out of character of the chaste mythic goddess to be having casual affairs with either gods or mortals. Like Artemis, she is supposed to be unconquerable, even by Eros."
8,9,2,"This would be amazing if I was an child and never had seen the movie but this wasn't the case so I didn't realy enjoyed this one but I'm curious what happens further on in the serie so I will continue plus the bright side of this book serie is the greek mythology wich I love and the fast pacing, gave this book 2 ⭐⭐"
9,10,2,"I read the e-version and it had some glaring typo and grammar mistakes....but that isn't enough to put me off a book if it's fast paced and contains a balanced mix of realism and fantasy, and a refreshing lack of vampires, zombies and other blood-thirsty examples of the nether world.

Rick Riordan certainly scores with weaving Greek mythology into the present-day US, and as a means of introducing Greek gods to reluctant students, this is as good a means as any.

What I didn't like was the ADHD aspect to Percy's personality - the symptoms described didn't seem to match personal experiences of the condition and there was a tick-box mentality towards cataloguing the known or possibly attributable characteristics of ADHD from which Percy suffers. The flip-side to that is that Percy's ADHD 'weaknesses' are turned into positives in Riordan's take on the making of a god, and given all the uncomfortable press ADHD receives, this has to be a plus for any kid who has been labelled ADHD/Asperge's Syndrome/Autism Spectrum.

For an average 12 year old suffering with ADHD, Percy comes across as being far more perceptive than is possible, able to vanquish his foes without any basis other than being hyperactive and therefore possessing super-fast reflexes. Annabeth seems much older and is set up from their first meeting as a love interest, regardless of her crush on the older, more accomplished Luke. Luke is nicely foreshadowed at the beginning of the book, but Mr D is a little tedious by the end. The description of the Furies is a nice twist, as is the modernisation of Olympus and the reasoning behind its present location.

It's an easy, fast read for the age group at which it's aimed, and despite being an HP copycat, Percy Jackson brings a slew of different characters and adventures to fill some of the breach left with the vanquishing of Voldy. It won't provide the same emotional intensity as HP, but it's a fun-filled way to catch up on some ancient Greek in an American setting."

This is another one of those books that I had passed on, but then got prompted to read it by a mixture of high praise and the fact that all of my friends seemed to have read it - saving the one I read it with.

My verdict is very middle-ground - didn't love it, didn't have it, and ambivalent about continuing.

It was entertaining enough, but there were things that bugged me.

For one, I kind of got bored with the constant battles. It was like reading a game of Zelda or Final Fantasy where the random encounters just got ridiculous. Now, I know some of them made sense, since they were being chased and all, but some of them really were pretty random. Also, I didn't really feel any suspense or anything in the battles. They all seemed too easy, really.

There's a part of me that wants to give it some credit for sticking with the sort of story arc of things like the Odyssey, but there's a bigger part of me that just started rolling my eyes when there was yet another battle.

Intro, battle, travel, battle, intro, battle, travel, battle, travel, battle, intro, battle, ad nauseum.


My second issue was with the characters. Two things: 1) they're not really all that developed and 2) they're all really stupid.

And I don't mean ""learning disability"" - I mean just stupid.

Like how when everyone was ""Hey, I wonder who Percy's dad is"", and completely ignored the very ample evidence that, at the very least, it's got something to do with water.

Like how people thought that Percy stole shit with no evidence that dude was even there. Do they have no security at all on Olympus? Can no god figure out anything?

I mean, sure, the Greek gods are kinda flighty, but damn.

And, lumping this in, little inconsistencies like why does Chiron stuff himself into the magical wheelchair when he's in the camp?


And, speaking of learning disabilities, I can't say I really liked how they were handled in this book. The whole ""your dyslexic 'cause your brain is hardwired for ancient Greek"" makes zero sense. I mean, even assuming that a demigods brain works differently, which I guess it must, it still makes no sense.

Also, the ADHD thing. I wasn't as bothered by it being a built-in battle system (though, actually, yeah, I am, 'cause not all the gods or Greeks are warriors, ya know?) - but I was more bothered, at the time, by things like when Percy is listening to some guy talk and has a random thought about what he's wearing, or something, and this is an example of ADHD.

'Cause, kid, then *everyone* has ADHD. Seriously.

I know the whole thing where Riordan wanted that in there 'cause of his kid , but you'd think someone who has a kid with ADHD would describe it better than having a random side thought when someone is talking to you.


So, yeah - this is why, when rating it, I bumped it down to 2. Entertaining enough, but there were a lot of things that just bugged me.

I can see why people like it, especially those who are less analytically prone than I am, but it just didn't work for me.

I might read the next in the series and see if it gets better, 'cause, like I said, I didn't hate it and it had its charm... and I already have the book... so...

It's not likely to be in the near future, though."
11,12,2,
12,13,2,"After teaching the first two chapters of this book to a class (the director of the school had selected it) I was intrigued. I borrowed the book from the school so I could finish it.
But it was all downhill from there.

Here's what I liked about the book:

1. The first two chapters were mysterious and intriguing.
2. The language was rich and interesting, at least in the beginning.
3. The story combined a contemporary setting with Greek mythology.
4. The author portrays disabilities as having special powers behind them. (Not only Percy's dyslexia and ADHD, but also Grover's strange legs and Mr. Brunner's wheelchair.)

Here's what I didn't like about the book:

1. The writing got sloppier and sloppier as the story progressed.
2. The author tried too hard to be humorous too often, so that the story couldn't make up its mind between being a serious fantasy hero's quest and a slapstick comedy. In many places, reading it felt like watching a TV sitcom.
3. Once Percy was given a quest, the plot didn't make much sense from there on out. For one thing, we all knew he wasn't the one who stole the lightning bolt in the first place. The more we learned about who did, the less sense it all made. After finishing the whole book, I'm left with the feeling of ""WHAT??""
4. The monsters were all too easily defeated, making it feel like they were not really threatening at all.
5. Most of the problems that happened on the way from New York to L.A. were overcome before the next problem was encountered, making it feel episodic rather than thickening the plot.
6. The part in the Lotus Casino was an interesting idea, but it would have been better if the reader had more hints before Percy figured out what was happening.
7. The main characters were annoying. I had to follow three annoying young teens all the way from NY to LA and back again.
8. Percy and his buddies were able to complete a task for a god that the god himself dared not even try to do. Yeah, they ran into problems, but it was still a little too easy.
9. It was too predictable. Despite the obstacles, we all knew that Percy was going to get to where he was going in time and do the thing he was supposed to do. No real twists or surprises there (except that the explanation for it was very long and complicated.)
10. The monsters and gods and traitors that tried to fight Percy would tell their life story to him before fighting or tricking him. This was the author's way of explaining their motives to the reader and revealing some facts we need to know. But I don't think monsters would usually tell you everything they know before they try to kill you.
11. There were too many info dumps. In the beginning, they were integrated into the story better. Toward the middle and end, they just seemed so artificial.
12. Percy's dyslexia wasn't realistic. The explanation is that his eyes are hard-wired to read Greek, not English. That doesn't make any sense. Our brains and eyes are hard-wired to learn to make sense of the squiggles of any writing system. Furthermore, I don't think that dyslexics see words in the same way that Percy misread the signs on buildings, with letters jumbled at random.
13. There were many times when Percy went where the author wanted him to go. Like in L.A. when there is only one store that looks open, and it just happens to be the kind of store they are looking for. Or the time when Percy willingly gets in an elevator with a woman and her dog that he senses are monsters because he thinks that waiting for the next elevator will take too much time. Obviously, Percy wouldn't have really done that. The author just wanted Percy to battle that one alone.
14. Percy's dream descriptions were long and didn't make any sense. Maybe someone with more patience would have picked up some clues from them. But I just found them confusing.

Rick Riordon has a lot of talent and potential to write something great. I hope that his writing has improved with later books. However, because this one was a sorely disappointing waste of time, it will be the last of his books that I read."
13,14,2,"The writing style is accessible to kids and teens, so I give the author a star for that, but god damn if I don't find the premise absolute bunk.

If gods can't even be part of their demigod children's lives, then why are they fucking mortal women in the first place? Seems to be a lot more grief than it's worth, or the gods just don't give a shit about the suffering their mortal lovers had/have to go through.

That makes the gods pretty shitty, and the shittiest of them all being the one responsible for that rule in the first place.

Also, the whole learning disability thing being a touch of divinity. Ha! Look, I'm not making fun of people with learning disabilities. They have to work hard at what many people take for granted, but tying this in with the gods was just a fucking load of cockamamie.

I'm all for urban fantasies and retellings/twists of old mythology and fairy tales, but the premise for this series just doesn't cut it. And to be really able to enjoy a book or series, the premise has to be at least somewhat believable if not perfect."
14,15,2,"Rick Riordan should learn from Jonathan Stroud and JK Rowling on how write characters and plots. Middlegrade story is not an excuse for juvenile writing with too many cliches, tropes and cringeworthy dialogues. One star.

The idea is cool though. I myself would love to be Poseidon's lovechild. I wouldn't have to worry about sharks and could be the greatest freediver in the whole seven seas. Bye bye expensive, heavy scuba gears, stinging hydroids, and decompression sickness! On that happy note, extra one star."
15,16,2,"Reading this book was like watching a Disney movie, entertaining but, in a way, somewhat predictable."
16,17,2,"“The real world is where the monsters are.”
I did it. I’ve finally read The Lightning Thief. This is one of the most well-known middle grade books ever, so I was very curious about it. Also, my friend Álex has been trying to make me read it for almost two years now. So here we are. I’ve read it, but unfortunately it wasn’t for me. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think it’s a bad book at all. Quite the opposite, actually. I think it’s a funny book full of adventures that the target audience for this series is going to enjoy. I’m sure I would have love it if I had read it 10 years ago, but now it was just a boring and predictable book for me.

This is the story of Percy Jackson, a twelve-year-old boy whose life is about to change when he discovers he’s a demigod, a half-blood. And with that premise, Rick Riordan presents us a story full of Greek mythology set in our modern world. I think it was a very cool idea to include such famous gods, goddesses and monsters in Riordan’ own version and, at the same time, doing references to the original myths. Also, I loved the fact that the dyslexia and ADHD are part of the half-blood powers.

My problem with this book and the reason why it was just for me was the plot. I found it way predictable, to the point that it bored me. The traitor was so ridiculously obvious from the beginning that I still can’t believe it took the characters until the end of the book to figure it out. Also, some things were very convenient for my liking.

I was also shocked by the fact that we get to know more about the Olympian gods and goddesses than Percy’s companions through his quest: Annabeth Chase (another half-blood at the Camp Half-Blood and Athena’s daughter) and Grover (a satyr and Percy’s classmate at Yancy Academy). I actually felt they were quite plain in , especially Annabeth. I was a bit intrigued by her, but we barely get to know her in this first book. The only information we have about her is who her parents are and a couple of aspects about her personality, but nothing more.

So I don’t think I’ll continue the series, I’m not invested in the characters or the story. The only reason why I would read the next books is because I like the way Riordan includes Greek myths in the story. But honestly, even that it’s not enough for me to continue reading about Percy and his friends. Nevertheless, I think is a funny and quick read, perfect for its target audience."
17,18,2,"I will try reading this book another time in my life, and hopefully i will like it more then."
18,19,2,"Apparently the Percy Jackson series has a cult following akin to that of Harry Potter, which was largely unbeknownst to me until my friend pointed it out. Though I can see why Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief may be appealing to young audiences, it's amazing to me how it is so popular when the books have such little merit.

The Lightning Thief is the first book of the Percy Jackson series written by Rick Riordan. It follows Percy Jackson, son of the Greek God Poseidon, as he journeys to the Underworld to recover Zeus's lightning bolt to prevent a war among the Olympian Gods.

I understand whyis appealing. I understand perfectly. Percy's characterization appeals to young teenagers who have felt, in one point or another in their life, out of place, isolated, alienated, awkward or on the fringe of teenage normality. Percy's poor performance at school is easily explained by the genetics on his father/Greek God's side, his inability to pay attention is because of his instinct to stay alive - essentially, every flaw that has plagued Percy's life is explained by the fact that he is a superior human being. And as a young teenager, or else as a person in a confusing stage in your life, I can certainly see why that is appealing.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying teenagers are petty for finding this sort of novel empowering; in fact, I get it. Even for me, it appeals for my want to become something greater than what I am now, or being part of something that is larger than life. But the problem is that beyond this - and the integration of Greek mythology into the novel - the merits of this book are sparse.

Bearing in mind that the target audience is for children to teenagers, the narrative is simplistic, and I am unsure if that is due to the limitations of the author or because Percy is a young adult with a teenage voice. But then again, even simple writing can be sophisticated, and lacks that sort of sophistication and refinery, or insight in the overarching ideas of the novel.

The primary failing of this novel, however, is the execution of the plot. If you detach the plot itself from how it was executed, then the story is decent. It's a children's book that has potential, especially because it is eventful and can be interesting. But the events of the novel felt disjointed and spliced together, like a compilation of 'mini adventures of the Lightning Thief' amalgamated into one book. Understandably the eventfulness of the book is to probably keep readers entertained, but when the events do not contribute to the story or are not completely meaningful in building towards the book's climax, then it feels very underwhelming and pointless in the end. For me, it felt like Riordan chose including an assortment of cool mythological creatures for the sake of 'coolness' over coherent storytelling. Essentially, is poorly written.

Furthermore - and many readers have already pointed this out - Percy may have 'challenges' but they aren't challenging, or else do not feel so. His successes are predictable and thus feel largely undeserved. The challenges that Percy faces are 'challenges' in terms of what a quest should have, but ultimately the quest taught him nothing about himself or did not challenge his development as a character - which is what a quest should ideally do for someone.

Also, a  gripe that I have with this book was that it had many eurocentric and Americentric undertones. The Western world is the greatest force in the world? The Olympian Gods are centred in America because it is the most powerful force? I won't even delve into the problems that sort of ideology has caused; these are the ideologies that uphold systems of oppression, justify imperialism and American supremacy. For that sort of ideology to seep into a children's book -- this sort of rhetoric has no place in children's books. Kids may not understand the impact that sort of thinking may impact the world, but it will impact how they perceive it. (Not to mention Chiron was extremely preachy about it too.)

To sum it up: is average. It's easy to read because of its simplistic narrative and characterization, but it makes no attempts to gauge or emotionally or mentally challenge its readers. It is escapism material with very little merits, though it has enough for it to be entertaining. Maybe is one of those books that you give to kids that don't like reading to ease them into the idea that reading Personally, had potential but it's lack of boldness, problematic undertones and poor plot execution left much to be desired.

Review can also be found on my book blog,"
19,20,2,"Hm... Maybe I need to stop seeing movies before I read the book. Here's another movie that I felt was better done than the book. The movie made some *major* plot changes that I felt filled in holes that were left in the book and streamlined a lot of overly long and complicated series of events.

There are a lot of events and explanations in this book that require a great deal of suspension of belief to swallow, even apart from the Greek god and monster parts. The author often relies on weak logic to tie it all together, and Percy is at times painfully slow and dim-witted. Perhaps this is an effort to make him seem like a typical 12-year-old boy, but he's also a demigod - so shouldn't he have a basic or even above-average level of intelligence?

Don't get me wrong - this is an easy, fun, entertaining read, and I liked being reminded of the Greek myths (since I haven't thought about that subject since high school). Mostly, though, the first book of this series left me nostalgic for the Harry Potter series. Same premise (young gifted black-haired 12-year-old boy goes to a special school for students with special powers, makes friends with a smart girl and a goofy, wisecracking male and goes on quests) - but J.K. Rowling is the far superior story teller. Still, I might read Book 2 in this series. We'll see."
20,21,2,"This was recommended to me by the 11 year old son of one of my best friends, so of course I had to read it! He's totally captivated by greek mythology, so I can see why he'd love this series so much.

The first book was a decent read, but truthfully, after reading Harry Potter, it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for another boy with special powers. Harry's hard to beat IMO.

That said, Riordan's done his homework, and has certainly made a good case for energizing greek mythology and injecting a modern twist to the old tales. I would imagine that young boys 9-13 would really like this series, and if it get's them to read, then I say bravo to Riordan."
21,22,2,I guess I will be writing a review once I watch the movie!
22,23,2,"2 Star's!!

This was okay, def for the younger audience. I don't have much else to say about it sooo....."
23,24,2,"Narration: The first person perspective brings unique challenges, especially for a children's book. Riordan fails entirely to surmount these challenges. The narrator goes from sounding way too smart and too interested in describing random crap one minute to being a complete dunce the next.

Plot: One of the things that makes a good children's book be an adult book as well is that you don't figure out too much in advance. If the author made the overarching plot any clearer he would have just put it on the first page, with all the excessive hints he gives to the main character (which, by the way, the main character ignores)

Character: Speaking of which, am I supposed to love these characters? Because I don't. They all come off as flat. Percy is an idiot who somehow lucks into pretty much everything. Is he not amazed by this world? Does he not want to explore his own powers when he starts to discover his control of water? I think the author forgot what it is like to be a kid. The girl is not memorable and has stereotypical female weakness forced upon her, and Grover is unsympathetic and boring.

Action: The action sequences are completely lacking. Why and how does Percy manage to just luck into win after win? Everything is simplistic, there is no depth and the escapes are all too easy. If Percy can do this, anyone can and its nothing special. And, how on earth do they manage to run into every ""monster"" known to man in one 10 day trip?

World Creation: Riordan goes out of his way to incorporate as much mythology as possible, but his world lacks a desirability that is needed in this type of book. The world he creates is so capricious and corrupt that I cannot see how any kid would want to enter it. I have to agree with the first few lines that, based on this book, its great I am not a half blood. Essentially, world, the magic, etc, lack fun, wonder, and whimsy. Also, there is distinctive moments where this seems to just rip imagery and ideas about how Gods would be on earth from Neil Gaiman's

Concept: This is a great concept. That is what makes the rest so sad. This could be such a GREAT world, and such interesting plotline and awesome action scenes, but its not. It just falls entirely flat."
24,25,2,"I am too old for this.

That, or it completely lacks the magic that other children's lit possesses. I just finished reading, for the first time, The City of Ember and I adored it. I completely went down the rabbit hole with that one. With Percy, I was just along for the ride and a little disenchanted by the whole thing. It didn't have the charm, the energy, the discovery or the wonder that books like Ember, Narnia, Alice in Wonderland, and The Indian in the Cupboard possess. These are my true, all-time favorite children's books that I can read again and again, as an 8-year-old or a 38-year-old (not quite there yet, but for argument's sake!) and probably again as a 68-year-old, and feel, once again, like a kid reading up in a treehouse, and not like an adult who's too old to be holding this book in her hands."
25,26,2,"Praticamente un rifacimento in salsa mitologica di Harry Potter e la pietra filosofale: le analogie tra le due saghe si sprecano e sono talmente evidenti da risultare irritanti.
Se almeno l'autore avesse affrontato l'erculea fatica della caratterizzazione dei protagonisti, anziché ricalcare per filo e per segno le personalità del trio di rowlingiana fattura, forse i suddetti non sembrerebbero delle macchiette piatte e incolori e questo libro sarebbe più digeribile.
Se gli dei dell'Olimpo mi concederanno l'ispirazione, leggerò il seguito: sia mai che faccia la sua entrata in scena l'originalità, questa sconosciuta."
26,27,2,"I had such high hopes, I heard about so much and expected to love it. I also love greek mythology, so that is double disappointment. But 2.5 stars, that's it. My daughter though, would not agree at all, she really liked it.

I didn't care about any of the characters, I wasn't excited about what happened to them, and found most of the book quite boring. I guess Rick Riordan really aimed to the juvenile readers, and seems that he succeeded with his goal.

The idea is creative and interesting. Sons of Greek gods in modern times. But, the situations they got into weren't interesting, and of course they overcame any obstacle too easily.

I would not continue reading this series. Completely unnecessary in my opinion. Almost 2.5 starts."
27,28,2,"Now, this was a fast read! I absolutely enjoyed this book. Fast-paced, lots of fun, great characters.. not to metion that it's a wonderful way to learn more about greek mythology (yes, I know, I should have studied all that stuff at school but you know.. it was school and not a Percy Jackson's book so..). I just can't wait for all the characters to grow up so that I can enjoy this books even more."
28,29,2,"America is now the heart of the flame. It is the great power of the West.
There's a tiny, easy-to-miss joke in the movie Team America: when cutting to an establishing shot outside the US, it will needlessly relate the foreign country's distance from America. That distance acts as a gauge for just how much Americans really need to care. Jokes about American egocentrism aren't a new, or terribly clever, observation, but when I read the above quote, I was reminded of it. ""Western civilisation"" is referenced too: the Greek-rebrand colonialists used to mythologise their own conquering of unknown territories. In terms of culture and history, America is barely out of its infancy. Since slaughtering the natives and their culture, only three centuries has elapsed. There are bridges and walls I walk past daily that are twice as old. ""The West,"" and ""Western civilisation"" are phrases that evoke societies rising and falling in isolation, as if the world hasn't always been interconnected. Besides that, its hilarious that the Greek gods operate under such a modern understanding of the West and its global geopolitics.

That WW2 is directly related to a 1v1 between gods is a choice, for instance.

The whole story could take place in America because Percy is American, but no, lets have a sermon about America's pre-eminence in a mythology literally named after a country that still exists.

I'm not sure how I feel about how disabilities are treated here. A wheelchair user turns out to be a not-fully-human mythological creature. And Percy's learning differences — ADHD and dyslexia — are othered too, as being a byproduct of his half-blood heritage. I've always been of the opinion that these kind of differences should be normalised rather than pedestaled in any particular way. Good or bad. That's not to discredit the value of these kinds of depictions exactly. I just think they're not as valuable in the long-term.

Other than that, Percy is a twelve-year-old that learns he's the offspring of Poseidon and is tasked with recovering Zeus's lightning bolt, presumably stashed away in the Underworld. The plot is a basic fetch quest, and I spent a lot of time noticing the unfortunate similarities to . To be clear: isn't terribly unique, at all, but with its cultural dominance, the similarities hurt . The age of the main characters, the friend group of a diligent girl and a somewhat luckless boy; both attending a school/camp to hone their extra-special-unique abilities; and the fact that the first instalment is heavy with thunderbolt imagery. Also, the titular item turns out to be in the main character's possessions at the end, unbeknownst to him. A fearsome enemy in Kronos, presumed dead, but lurking in the shadows. It's by no means plagiaristic — Riordan and Rowling draw from the same well, and by the time was published, was on its fifth instalment. It wouldn't have hurt to tweak it a bit more to stand out.

The description of Hades is something else:
Just in case the references to Hitler, Napoleon and, presumably, bin Laden didn't immediately convey Hades isn't a great guy.
Luke was an absolute treasure trove of observations like this. Poor guy just wants some half-decent quests. Sadly, it also does that thing where the end is expository monologuing to wrap up every conceivable loose end in the plot. It's just as bad here. I did enjoy the twist on Percy having to let his mother save herself, even if her character is an afterthought.

The world of is a roller-coaster of loosely connected action sequences and a lathering of Greek mythology. As it is, ticks all the right marketability boxes without distinguishing itself in an oversaturated genre of plucky chosen ones."

31,32,2,"I had heard of this fantasy series from a few people, saw it on bookshelves a few weeks ago and then caught a teaser trailer for the upcoming movie, so I decided to give it a whirl. The initial appeal was the juxtaposition of Greek myths with the real world, and the idea that the cosmos are actually being controlled by these colossal deities whose lives are defined by monsters, magic and mayhem. So I bought the first three books in a box-set and dove right in. Here is my verdict on the first book, The Lightning Thief:

As far as plot goes, it's impossible to avoid any comparisons to the Harry Potter franchise. A child has powers unknown to him and, when threatened by the forces of evil, is ushered to a far-away magical place for kids with similar powers only to find that he's destined for greatness. It's simple and familiar, but in author Rick Riordan's world it's not Midas' touch. For starters, Riordan doesn’t incorporate Greek myths into the modern world as much as he waters them down. : For example, Medusa owns a shop where she sells statues, Procrustes owns a bed emporium, Poseidon wears a Hawaiian beach shirt and Ares resembles a Hell’s Angel. : Greek myths are suppose to be larger than life; towering, often terrible creatures that rise above the lot of mortals, engraved forever in the pantheon of ancient human culture. Here, that status is turned into a series of gags, and not very good ones.

The book takes off instantaneously from page one, as if readers were to have the same ADHD that the protagonist has. The book moves at a breakneck speed and has very few moments of imaginative brilliance. With the amount of material for inspiration, I was expecting an abundance of visual experiences. The book, however, is shockingly short on eye candy. Furthermore, it is written in first-person and in the language of a snappy but dull 11-year old. The problem with this is that Riordan gives himself carte blanche on describing things as ""pretty cool"", “awesome” or “a surfer dude”, and describing every single object in terms of how tall or far away it is instead of giving us any sensory comparisons. But my biggest pet peeve is the chapters’ names: each one sounds like the title of a Bruce Coville novel, and though they aim to draw out some chuckles, they all fall painfully flat.

All of the above leads to one simple conclusion: the target audience for this series is a much younger demographic. I will, however, finish books two and three to see if this changes. Not only can you finish these books in an afternoon, but they do suggest that there might be a big payoff in the end. Here’s to hoping."
32,33,2,"2,5 en realidad

Bueno, en realidad pienso que este libro debería haberlo leído en otro momento, estuve en una reading slump que afectó todas mis lecturas y ésta no fue la excepción. La verdad me gustó (algo), es entretenido pero le encontré como muchas cosas que no me gustaron tanto.

Los personajes son tan irreales más allá de que la mayoría de ellos son criaturas mitológicas, dioses, etc etc... no tienen reacciones humanas en lo absoluto. Este libro es un Middle Grey, lo entiendo, pero creo que si el autor no sabe manejar una muerte en un libro middle grey no deberían haber muertes.

La realidad es que estoy como enojado con este libro porque no fue lo que pensé, no me hizo sentir lo que pensé mis expectativas no estuvieron cumplidas por la mitad.

Fue un libro lindo pero creo que tiene una bola de hype al rededor que te llenan de ganas de encontrarte con algo que la verdad en mi caso... no encontré.
Annabeth Chase mi personaje favorito.

Quiero agregar algo que no puedo dejar pasar. Todo el mundo compara con demasía la saga Magisterium con la saga Harry Potter... esas mismas personas ¿de verdad no encuentran semejanzas entre la saga de Percy Jackson y la de HP? Lo dejó ahí para no hacer muy largo todo el asunto.

Uno de los factores que me gustó mucho es la cantidad de contenido de la mitología griega que hay. Amo la mitología y en este libro ese asunto está muy bien logrado. I mean, el crossover de Mitología Griega con el siglo XXI está muuuuuy bien logrado.

En fin tengo un sabor agridulce con este libro, me gustó y al mismo tiempo no, por eso decidí darle la mitad de la calificación máxima.

Todavía no estoy seguro si planeo seguir con la saga."
33,34,2,"The witty Percy Jackson is a 13 year-old half-blood. A half blood is a demigod that has evil monsters trying to kill him. After being kicked out of his boarding school, Percy, his best friend Grover, a curly haired centaur, and Percy’s mother set out for Montauk, Long Island. Their friendly trip is soon interrupted though, when the three come face to face with The Minotaur. After a grueling fight with the Minotaur, Percy’s mother is dissolved into nothing and Percy and Grover are left to find their own way. Then, Grover, along with Annabeth and her father, take Percy to Camp Half Blood. This camp houses demigods on Long Island. Soon after Percy’s arrival, tragedy strikes Mount Olympus. The all-powerful and mighty Zeus’ master lightening bolt is stolen and the prime suspect is Percy Jackson. Percy has to find Zeus’ property and return it to him within ten days while Mt. Olympus is in a Civil War. Once Percy discovers the real robber, he has to meet his father who ran out on his mother, the father who wanted to send Percy to Camp Half Blood from the start. Later, he confronts the Oracle’s riddle, warning him of a fault in the loyalty of a friend, and he must prove to Zeus that he is not the culprit. The Lightening Thief is a phenomenal read for those who enjoy science fiction/fantasy novels. The book contains action, comedy, and suspense. Rick Riordan is a genius of suspense and thrill. The book seems to absorb the reader into Percy’s thoughts. The reader is beside the character in Riordan’s descriptive vocabulary and exhilarating events."
34,35,2,"I don't get why so many adults think these books are so great. I can maybe understand kids loving them, but discerning adult readers (like myself, ho ho)? I found many elements that had obviously been adapted from Harry Potter, but that wasn't what annoyed me, no, what did was the plot line. It was Percy and Co. blithely walking into one encounter with a Greek god after another, and each time, there would be an obvious air of menace about the diner/shop/theme park they're about to enter, and Percy would feel 'slightly uneasy' or that 'something wasn't right' and then EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. It was unbelievably frustrating to have the main character act so blindly.
So the story felt jerky and episodic, and I didn't appreciate the rather dumb sense of humour throughout. The next Harry Potter? I think not!"
35,36,2,"DNF. Things I liked: the empowerment of little boys who had been labeled ADD/dyslexic underachievers.

Things I didn't like: Pedantic, dumbed-down writing (even though it's a middle school boy book, that doesn't mean you have to put pages and pages of blatant, boring explication in the mouths of secondary characters)

The first two girls we meet are villains, and both are described as ""ugly,"" and one as fat.

""Most teachers are monsters""?! Great way to screw over your middle school boy readers.

2 stars."
36,37,2,"I'll have to try and review this later.

It just wasn't my cup of tea unfortunately. Didn't really connect to the characters and I found myself tuning it out, (audio version) I didn't even care enough to go back and listen to what I missed.

Do the characters get older through out the series like HP? Or do they stay this young forever. I think that might be part of the issue of not connecting is because of the age differences."
37,38,2,Ya sevmeyi çok istedim ama sevemedim... Muhtemelen ileride bir şans daha vereceğim ama şimdilik böyle oldu
38,39,2,This book is very disappointing
39,40,2,"Pues... un meh. No ha estado mal, se deja leer, pero tampoco ha tenido nada que me haya parecido diferente o especial.

**Alerta Spoiler!!

1.-La historia. Percy, un niño de 12 años, es atacado por los monstruos porque resulta que es el hijo de uno de los dioses Griegos. Para estar a salvo se refugia en el campamento mestizo, donde lo mandan a una misión, recuperar el rayo de Zeus que ha sido robado por alguien que desea desatar la tercera guerra mundial.

2.-Los personajes. Percy, no está mal, tiene unos puntos de humor bastante buenos, lo que pasa es que luego resulta que tiene 12 años y no te crees parte de su comportamiento. Mejor imaginar como que tiene de 15 para arriba.
Grover, el sátiro que siempre va perdiendo los pies, es el graciosillo de la panda y es un compañero agradable.
Annabeth, la hija de Atenea, la inteligente del grupo.
Luego están los dioses que son como niños grandes, caprichosos, irascibles, egoístas...
La madre, que es un amor, y el imbécil del padrastro.
Y poco más se pude decir porque no es que haya mucho desarrollo ni trasfondo en los personajes.

3.-La pluma, la trama y demás. Es un libro con una trama ágil en la que no dejan de pasar cosas, y que va desvelando poco a poco la información que le interesa. Los capítulos son cortos y es agradable la forma en la que la mitología se integra con el mundo actual, pero hay cosas que son un poco de poner los ojos en blanco. Lo malo es que los personajes son niños que no actúan como niños. Es difícil imaginárselos con 12 años y no con 15 o 16 y eso le resta.

4.-El final. Bien. Ata los cabos, cierra lo que tiene que cerrar, y te deja sabiendo que la historia no ha hecho más que comenzar.

En fin 2,5 estrellas sobre 5 que se quedan en 2 porque sé que es un libro que ni siquiera leyéndolo unos cuantos años antes, hubiera conseguido hacerme pensar que era ""genial"" o ""espectacular"".

**Popsugar 2021 categoría 39. Un libro que parece haber leído todo el mundo excepto tú."
40,41,2,"Want to sign up for the greek Mythology class? you have come to the right place. The book seemed illogical and inconsistent at various places. The narrator is a twelve-year kid, who saw his mother almost die in front of him, do you think he would go around sounding so brave and cracking miserable jokes? Sometimes that boy is dyslexic and sometimes not.

The book had been over-explained, and not sure why, but again and again it has been made clear that any ugly or fat, or masculine girl is evil. Listening to opera has been compared to walking naked on a cactus farm. What's with the idea that America is the center of Western Civilisation and George Washinton is the son of Athena. The book was very much with the use of and greek Mythology jammed into it whenever the author got a chance.

I had such high hopes for pjo series but it failed me terribly, maybe I was not the target audience. Halfway into the book, I was basically dragging myself just to complete it anyhow. For kids it might be good but definitely wouldn't recommend it to any adult or even not to teenagers, there are great books out there, reading it just for knowing a little bit of pjo series is fine but don't get your hopes high."
41,42,2,"La lectura es muy ligera, Percy se me hace uno de los personajes más insufribles que he leído.

No lo soporté, de no ser lectura conjunta creo que lo hubiese abandonado. Lo terminé en un 24 hrs leyendo porque ya no soportaba al personaje.

Espero que la saga mejore. Este primer libro, me gustó la mención que hace a los mitos griegos y los personajes de Annabeth y Grover, pero creo que es lo único rescatable."
42,43,2,"2.5 stars

I didn’t really care for the series. The characters were fine. The plot was fine. The world building was fine. I thought that the underworld was interesting but i didn’t care about the camps. Part of the story it started sticking to a certain formula. Find a monster, fight it and move on. It got kinda boring. I didn’t really care about the quest or the gods. Nothing really stuck with me.

I did like that the main character was dyslexic and had ADHD. You don’t see that many characters especially in middle grade that is dyslexic."
43,44,2,"There seemed to be two different camps of thought when I read other reviews of The Lightning Thief, and they have very little common ground:

“Percy Jackson and the Olympians has a modern, hip, even urban style that people weary of Harry's earnest heroism may actually PREFER.” – “Like a Hipper Harry Potter” Amazon Review by bensmomma

“Maybe if you're aged between eight and 12, or exceptionally dim-witted, you may not notice that this is a tenth-rate rip-off of Harry Potter, with Greek mythology taking the place of magic.” - Chris Tookey

I am not as militant about it as Mr. Tookey, but I definitely do dub it “Potter Light”. As I was reading, I kept thinking about ninth grade English, where we analyzed West Side Story and how it was really a modern retelling of Romeo & Juliet. (The Nurse and Anita give the same advice, i.e. “stay away from that boy”, in the exact same act, etc.) However, you don’t need a class or to comb through either series for minor details to make the connection. The similarities are pretty hard to miss:

Percy has grown up with strange things happening to him throughout his life that he doesn’t understand. In sixth grade, he learns he is special and charged with saving the world in a prophecy, where he’s even also called “the one.” While at Camp Half Blood (Hogwarts) students are placed into tents by gods (not unlike the houses via sorting hat) and there are competitions between these groups to capture their flag (Quidditch). He has two sidekicks, one of which is a girl who is the brains of the trio. Chiron the centaur provides the sage advice (Dumbledore) to the young boy. He has a horrible step-dad Gabe (who is much like the Dursley’s) and discovers more about his parentage throughout the story. To get to Mount Olympus, you take the elevator to a floor that doesn’t exist in the Empire State Building, much like the 9 ¾ train platform to Hogwarts. So, while there are Gods and Goddesses instead of witches and wizards, basically the plot reads much like Harry Potter as a Mad Libs exercise.

However, this was not the worst part for me.

Most frustrating for me was how the plot is peppered with incredibly fortunate coincidences...you know, JUST when the characters need them. In Harry Potter, these lucky breaks are rarer and, more importantly, explained. For example, Dobby is able to disapparate in and out of Hogwarts, as well as the death eater’s basement to save Harry and his crew in The Deathly Hallows, because he is an elf. Voldemort considers elves beneath him, and therefore wouldn’t have thought of powers they have that wizards don’t, which is why they are able to escape. In contrast, Percy and his group were hungry, and a mysterious five-star hotel appears. They are given a credit card with an infinity symbol on the limit. They get to eat, shower, play for a while, and then take a taxi the rest of the way. No explanations or reveal of the characterization behind it. Just...Ta Da.

Also, it’s less offensive to me, but I’ll also note how the casual slang does not read as refreshingly “urban” as some credit it to be. More like a Caucasian forty-six-year-old who is trying very hard to sound “urban”. (Oh, wait…)

All that said, it still is a fast-paced action novel with the same timeless themes of good versus evil, and there is a reason why they work so well in HP. Young adolescents can definitely identify with Percy, his A.D.H.D. and dyslexia diagnoses, and his frustration with constantly being blamed for things he didn’t do. The Lightning Thief is entertaining and an easy read. It certainly never taxes one with obscure symbolism or requiring pondering analysis. It’s fun for what it is.

Bottom line? Is Rick Riordan ground chuck to J.K. Rowling’s tenderloin steak? Absolutely. Still, there’s nothing wrong with enjoying an occasional cheeseburger. Just know that’s what you’re ordering."
44,45,2,well that was dumb. can't believe i had to read this for school...
45,46,2,"Mi sono avvicinato a questo libro senza pretese e senza aspettative.
Immaginavo fosse una mezza cavolata scritta cavalcando l’onda lunga di Harry Potter, allontanandosi dalla magia e tirando invece in ballo la mitologia greca (idea affatto malvagia, anzi!, e che offre innumerevoli spunti…) ma speravo di venire contraddetto.
L’aver trovato in offerta il libro a meno di due euro mi ha aiutato a decidere di dargli una possibilità.

Purtroppo però mi sono ritrovato a confermare le impressioni iniziali.
L’idea di fondo è buona, o almeno lo potrebbe essere (gli Dèi esistono, non sono mai scomparsi, solo che non sono più in Grecia ma si sono spostati con l’Olimpo in America, visto che restano dov’è la civiltà occidentale… solo che ora cercano di dare meno nell’occhio. E continuano a copulare come conigli con i mortali, da cui il fiorire di mezzidei che i mostri amano cacciare e uccidere prima che questi crescano abbastanza da venire riconosciuti, individuati, addestrati e usati per cacciare mostri leggendari). E il ritmo dell’avventura non è malaccio, c’è abbastanza azione da non fare addormentare il lettore e da condurlo rapidamente alle pagine finali.
Questo però, per quanto mi riguarda, è tutto quello che ho trovato di buono nel libro.

Perché posso sorvolare sulla banalità e sulla prevedibilità della storia, posso passare sopra al fatto che il giovane Percy che studia i più oscuri miti ed eroi dell’antica Grecia non riconosca le Norne al chioschetto lungo la strada… ma l’assenza di introspezione psicologica (arrivato in fondo al libro ancora non so che carattere abbia Percy, a parte che vuole bene alla mamma e odia il patrigno, ed è amico del satiro Grover) no, non la posso ignorare.
Come non posso trascurare il fatto che la storia, raccontata in prima persona da Percy fin dal titolo dei capitoli, non mi entusiasmi per niente, anzi tenda ad allontanarmi dal libro.



No, francamente penso che per quanto mi riguarda l’incontro con Percy Jackson finisce qui…"
46,47,2,"I did not enjoy this book! I thought it had a creative plot (half-blood greek god children living in today's world), but I just didn't think the writing was all that great. The thing that bugged me the most was that the character development was lacking. The characters weren't fleshed out very much so I didn't become attached to them. In fact, you don't even find out what the main character, Percy, looks like until like the last chapter. I also thought the dialogue was extremely cheesy and fake. It was appropriate for the characters to use teenager slang and such, but like I said, it was cheesy and fake. And finally, a small thing, but there was a TYPO in this book! I know most people would have read over this without even noticing, but I notice little things like this... on page 231 it says, ""She snatched an entire row of stuff of the racks and disappeared into the changing room."" (Should be stuff OFF the racks) Okay, sorry for slamming this book, I was just disappointed with it. It's obvious that there are going to be sequels to this book, but I'm not really interested in reading them. I did really like all of the references to greek gods and myths, though. It made me want to go read more about that! I loved learning about that in middle school."
47,48,2,"The one where Percy discovers that he has something a little more serious than ADHD and a bad school record: He actually has a destiny from his father, a Greek god.

I read this only semi-voluntarily; my mother had gotten it for my nine-year-old, and then begun to worry that it might have something inappropriate in it. If I hadn't been providing parental supervision, I wouldn't have finished it.

The chapter titles are marvelous (""In Which I Accidentally Vaporize My Pre-Algebra Teacher""), but that sense of humor isn't evident anywhere else. And -- look, I'm certainly not going to say that 's character-building and world-building are flawless, but they're There's more happening in the small corners of one chapter of Harry Potter than in this entire book.

The characters are flat collections of motivation+conflict with no eccentricities. The world is as thin as a stage set; there's nothing there that doesn't serve a purpose, nothing that's been tossed in just from the sheer joy of creation.

For the record, I didn't find anything I considered inappropriate for a nine-year-old. I just thought it was boring."
48,49,2,"Kids these days! They are obsessed with this series, but I mostly just found the opening volume flat and dull. The Harry Potter comparison is the obvious one to make, and as several other reviewers have pointed out: even at J.K. Rowling’s CAPSLOCKY worst, her books are bursting with more imagination and world-building on a single page than Riordan manages in his entire tale. The M.O. of this story seems to be “demigod preteens go somewhere, something mythological shows up.” These cameos aren’t particularly imaginative or revealing—Medusa has a fruit stand/roadside shop with a statue garden! Blah blah—nor are the main characters dynamic enough to make me really care. So it’s not bad—it’s just . Okay, fine—I can keep showing kids where we keep the series in the shop; I don’t have to read it."
49,50,2,"I could see that Rick Riordan had a bud of potential when he struggled to write this book. But as soon as I got into it, Riordan stomped on that bud and ripped those roots out of the ground in a flash. Don't get me wrong, this book has humor, suspense, adventure, etc. But the author laid everything out flat, thinking that kids wouldn't be smart enough to look over the hills. Some children are actually capable of inference and context clues. (I know! Shocker!)
Another thing, either I'm an old, blind, dumb man or there was no character development for Percy whatsoever. Maybe he grew without my mind comprehending it. But Percy seemed like the same loser who happened to gain some friends along the way. That bothers me. Character development is critical if you want the reader to relate with the character better. Humans learn from their mistakes. Learning=changing. I expected Percy to change in the next book, Sea of Monsters. As far as I could tell he hadn't changed one bit.
Overall this book wasn't too terrible. I did expect a little more from the author but it's okay."
50,51,2,"My siblings had been recommending this series for a while, so I decided to give the first book a chance. It was about this boy (Percy) who discovered that his life was pretty weird. After a couple of really weird things happened to him, he was sent off to a demigod boot camp! He gets sent off on a quest and the rest of the book is about that quest. I personally didn't really enjoy the book just because imaginary things aren't my favorite genre, and when I read books, I like to be able to imagine exactly what everything in the book looks like and this book made that pretty hard. I won't be reading the rest of the books, but at least I gave it a try. The author is really talented with these types of books, and I'm not saying the book is bad, it just doesn't interest me."
51,52,2,"A lot of people ask me why I don’t like this book, since kids love them, so I decided to leave a review.

First, I think the main qualification of being a high quality young adult or children’s work of literature, is the book needs to still be enjoyable and appealing to adults. If your main goal in reading is page-turning, adrenaline rushes, this book might appeal to you - for the first 3-4 chapters - until you realize that almost every chapter repeats itself in the same sequence and then becomes gruelingly predictable: main character encounters a weird person, weird person turns out to be a bad guy, bad guy tries to kill him, main character narrowly escapes death, and repeat ...

There is no depth here. Minimal character development. No real moral lesson. In short: it’s twaddle."
52,53,2,"While it steals from the Classics, this will never be a classic. This is a thoroughly mediocre book. The underlying idea is good enough - a modern day revisiting of Greek myths. The first person perspective could be an interesting choice. However, the incredibly unoriginal treatment steals significantly from the Harry Potter series then adds large chunks of silly pop culture references that will make this book seem dated in a couple of years. The juvenile sense of ""humor"" also drags this book down. This is a flavor of the month that will fade away just like the disposable Top 40 hits it mentions."
53,54,2,"Alright. So, I have read this before but I decided to give the series another try. Still not liking it. Don't like the characters, the action was so random and unimportant. Percy was stupid and uninteresting. Annabeth was unlovable. She didn't have a personality outside of rude and blah. Grover, however, was likable. I too eat when I am stressed. The action came at random spots and barely seemed to contribute to the story. All in all, this really wasn't a good book. I'm going to try and finish the series, but I don't know if I will be able to make it."
54,55,2,"While I genuinely like greek mythology and everything that surrounds it, this book was a bit hard for me to get through. Perhaps because I am not the exact target audience, but alas. I liked the book and I will certainly continue reading the series. Just hoping that i'll like the rest a little bit more."
55,56,2,"I had such a rough time with this book. It was too cheesy for me, I am blown away by how much kids love it- and that's really all that matters. It made a fabulous tween program and now I know enough to do a good recommendation to a kid."
56,57,2,Do yourself a favor and leave this one to the 8 year old boys. 😩
57,58,2,"Pretty dull for an adult, but probably great for a 10 year old."
58,59,2,It wasn't definitely my right time to read this book.
59,60,2,"The writing was flat, the story was cliche, it all felt so déjà vu and I struggled to finish."
60,61,2,am I human?
61,62,2,"Look, I do my star ratings by how much I enjoyed the book, not as a measure of its objective worth, so don't come for me. This is obviously a your mileage may vary scenario. But I really, really didn't enjoy reading this book. I struggle with first person perspective at the best of times and I just didn't like being in Percy's head. Also, the whole ""old, ugly woman = evil monster"" trope got old really quickly. If this hadn't been a bookclub pick I would have DNFed quite early on. Ah well, can't enjoy them all."
62,63,2,"This was lost on me, it was just ok. Mostly, I was put off by the portrayal of disability and the awful language they used to describe it: weak, powerless, crippled, stupid, wheelchair bound, but wait, just kidding - they’re not disabled, the disability is fake to hide their magical skills. It’s so over played. This was flagged as notable to me because Percy has ADHD and a learning disability, but even that is just hidden magical whatever. Why couldn’t they be magical, powerful, and disabled? This doesn’t promote acceptance, it’s just ablest nonsense."
63,64,2,

STORY BRIEF:
Percy is dyslexic with ADHD. His mother raised him alone. He doesn’t know who his biological father is. Odd things have happened to him but he never questioned them. At age eleven a minotaur attacks Percy and his mother causing the mother to disappear. Percy ends up at Camp Half Blood where he discovers that he is a godling (child of a Greek god father and a human mother). The other kids there are also godlings. Each child has talents and skills relating to their Greek god parent. As godlings age they have stronger vibes which draws monsters to attack them.

Someone has stolen Zeus’ master lightning bolt. Percy is selected to go on a quest to get it and return it to Zeus to avoid a war among the gods. Grover and Annabeth accompany Percy. They are given some magic objects to help them, for example a hat that makes one invisible, and a pen that turns into a magic sword. As they travel to get the bolt, monsters attack them on a regular basis.

REVIEWER’S OPINION:
This book is extremely similar to the Harry Potter stories - just change wizards to godlings. I loved the Harry Potter books, but when I read this book I was bored. But I could see reading it to a child under the age of eleven. The main character Percy is a little slow and doesn’t figure things out very quickly. So I could see a child guess things before Percy does and feel good about it. But I haven’t read it to a child, so I’m not sure about this.

It reminded me of children’s computer games where the character is on a quest. To solve the problem the character must travel to different locations and do tasks to get trinkets. When they get all the right trinkets the problem is solved and they get the main prize. But it was missing the character development, depth, and creativity that Harry Potter had. It was mostly kids on a journey and when fighting a monster they’d yell at each other “run.”

Throughout the journey Percy gets clues in the form of riddles. The oracle tells him where to go, and then tells him he won’t succeed with part of it but doesn’t explain. Later another fantasy creature tells Percy something that helps but also creates some unknown. These sources are supposed to be helping Percy, but they give him riddles to be solved. What kind of help is that? Why don’t they just tell him what they know? But that is me. To a young child it’s probably fine. I do not recommend it for teens and young adults. But it’s better than nothing, so if interested they might try the first book from the library and see how they feel.

Yes, there were riddles in the Harry Potter books, but they didn’t bother me the way the riddles here did. Riddles can be fine. I’m not against riddles. I think it had something to do with other things in the story not working for me.

It’s told in first person by Percy which did not appeal to me. He sounded like a typical contemporary eleven-year old using slang such as “that sucks” and “wwwwwhatever.” I didn’t care for the narrator, but that was personal preference. I kept wondering what his accent was. He said bit, ind, and ixactly (instead of but, and, and exactly – the generic TV speak which I’m used to).

75,76,2,"- Letture per il nipotame -
Il problema non è tanto il suo essere derivativo (Harry, Hermione & Ron go to the summer camp + American Gods for children + Saint Seiya).
Il problema è che fa veramente poco per nasconderlo, e che Riordan non ha lo stile piacevolissimo della Rowling (o i traduttori sono meno dotati, in questo caso non vedo nulla che possa spingermi a leggere l'originale).

Punto a suo favore, ed è un grosso punto, l'interesse che può facilmente generare verso la mitologia greca. Ma, a pensarci bene, sarebbe bastata Pollon..."
76,77,2,"Wanted to give this book another try after hearing repeatedly how much better the series and the author's works in general get when it comes to diversity later on. And I enjoyed myself enough this time around to give it a second star, mostly because the three main characters are so likeable and fun to read about (Percy himself took a while to grow on me, but he did).

In addition to my complaints mentioned in the original review below, what also bothered me this time were some rather... unfortunate... phrasing (""crippled"", ""wheelchair-bound"" (for a character who is also just
), describing darker skin as ""chocolate"" etc.) and the repetitiveness of the plot in the middle part of the book where the protagonists stumbled from one short encounter with a mythological beast to the next short encounter with a mythological beast with little to set them apart.

I did, however, really like one bit near the very end, namely that
, which is much more than I had expected from this book at this point.

Original review from March 2014 (1 star):

It's not a book I suppose, but even after 45% (or whatever the equivalent is in page numbers) there's just nothing there to keep me interested and more than a few things that annoy me to no end. From the little bits that I chalk up to personal preference (like me being driven up the wall by the ""America is so amazing, it's the True Heart of the West"" explanation for why this story about Greek gods in modern times takes place in the US instead of, oh, I dunno, Greece) to other bits such as there being a grand total of one sympathetic female character in the first half of the book who doesn't get fridged. Add to that that the narrative structure doesn't appeal to me and I have to wonder why I even read this far. (I blame the chapter titles. Those are kinda fun.)

Other things I didn't like:
- the narrative voice. Percy-the-narrator sounded less like a kid telling us his story and more like a middle-aged man desperately trying to sound like a kid telling us his story. I read Animorphs ffs and I still can't put up with this.

- the utter predictability of it all. And before someone says anything, yes of course I know this is a kids book. I read plenty of those that manage to pull what are essentially predictable plots off with more elegance.

I've heard that the series gets better later on, but the thing is, at this point I just don't care.
Oh well. Lots of other fish in this sea of books."

The concept is so promising (I love me some modern twists on mythology) and I've been meaning to read it for quite some time. But within the first chapter I knew that me and this book were going to have problems. Most notably because of Percy's narrative voice.

First person narration can be used to great effect but it takes significant talent, particularly when the narrator is a child. But throughout this book Percy's voice never felt authentic let alone likeable. Every joke cracked and most every thought Percy has felt as if it had first been forced through a ""Kids are dumb right?"" meat grinder. Annabeth (poor man's Hermione) and Grover (even poorer man's Ron) each possess a single motivation and otherwise felt flat.

I know I sound like a curmudgeon, and this book did make me feel like a joyless old man at times. But many of my favourite books (and many of the books I read to this day) are classified as YA/childrens literature. Having an intended audience is no excuse to treat the reader like a moron. There is a line between writing for children and writing AT children (ie. catering) and this book crosses/pole-vaults over it.

What's worse is that because I was forced into Percy's head I became painfully aware of the fact that Percy NEVER REACTS APPROPRIATELY TO ANYTHING! Every single situation, from near death experiences to the apparent deaths of those close to him, feeds through Percy's demi-god brain with a levity that never stopped pissing me off. I will admit that I shouted at Percy several times.

None of this was helped by the fact that I listened to the book and the audiobook narrator made a number of performance choices that grated on my nerves. But I still place the majority of the blame for my woes on the writing of Mr.Rick Riordan.

If you're looking for an unfailingly pleasant romp of a read, or you're willing to overlook a lot for the sake of the cool premise, go ahead. But I went in with those thoughts in mind and was still repeatedly frustrated."
80,81,2,"★★☆☆☆ / 2

The first thing that came to my mind while reading this was: “I would have loved this so much if I was a kid”.

And that was my whole experience in a nutshell with this book.

Percy Jackson was entertaining, funny and easy to read, and that’s it. I’m an avid reader since I was very young but I managed to skip reading “classics” like , , etc… And that applies to Percy Jackson’s books.

Despite not being the biggest fan of Harry Potter, I liked them a lot more than this one.

But, I must say, my biggest problem was another. I didn’t really remember much about the movie,

I get it, they sell you the Gods move around the world, and it could make sense, but WHY everything is in the United States? Am I really the only one who was extremely irked about this?

In my mind I couldn’t stop picturing this scenario in which I would write about other country mythology, like Japan, Russia… and just say I feel like I would have been heavily criticized?

I just couldn’t shake the feeling and it bothered me all the book."
81,82,2,"2.5 stars - The writing was good and it's not a bad story, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. It's very clear that it's a book for middle grade boys. I couldn't find any character I could relate to, and it's definitely a very action-driven story rather than character-driven, which is what I like. It was just one event after the other, and I never got emotionally invested or cared. I listened to it as an audiobook and might have even DNF'ed it but didn't have anything better to listen to. The narrator, Jesse Bernstein, was amazing though and I wouldn't mind listening to other stuff by him (but looking on Audible, he hasn't narrated any other book that I'm interested in, sadly).

I do LOVE that we get a book with a main character who has ADHD.

I won't be continuing with the series, but I may watch the movie.

Just a few random notes:
- I didn't like the depiction of Ares. Just the way the narrator voiced him and the way he kept calling Percy ""punk,"" I felt like he was just a random biker dude... and that's exactly the way the author ended up describing him. I feel like Wonder Woman had a much better depiction of Ares (but of course, the Wonder Woman movie came out like 12 years after this book was published). I just couldn't take Ares seriously for most of it.
- Why would Dionysus, a ~god~, spend a year teaching at a middle school just to keep an eye on Percy? I don't get it. You'd think ~gods~ have better things to do, but then again, I guess that's one of my bigger problems with the entire book.
- Slightly unbelievable that three pre-teens could travel cross-country from NY to CA all by themselves. (Given, Grover is 25 but like a 12 year old? That's another problem. We have a 25 year old friends with a 12 year old.)
- And more I can't remember right now."
82,83,2,"I can't say that it's amazing nor lousy. So I think I'll have to settle into so-so

I tried hard not to think of Harry Potter while reading but I can't help it.. the similarity is just overwhelming. That I had to repeatedly remind and correct myself that the heroes name were Percy, Annabeth and Grover, not Harry, Hermoine and Ron respectively. And that they were divided according to their cabins and who's their parents are and not into houses or their ability. and most annoyingly that it is , not . It is a place not !

Even Percy's appearance, hello, black hair? Green eyes? I'm pretty certain I already met someone with the same descriptions but under a different name, in different pages of a different book penned by a different author. Sigh.

Percy Jackson and the Olympians and Harry Potter. Different books but the story is startlingly the same.

But what it failed to capture is the magic the boy wizard had cast to it's readers, or to me, for all I can remember from this book is it's just a great copy of a story I had grown to loved. i guess if i read this before HP i might have a different reaction/reception to this book, after all, it was a fun and quick read. HP was just better.

X'cess: while reading I had imagine Daniel, Emma and Rupert as the three leads. Lol. Even imagined Cerberus as Fluffy."
83,84,2,"SO . . . I would have given this book a 3 star BUT all the talk about marriage not being important brought my rating down to a 2 star. I know, I'm a total prude -- but seriously!! I was really bothered by this conversation:

Percy ""I thought she was married to somebody""
Grover ""What's your point?""
Percy ""So they have a thing going""
Annabeth ""That's old gossip Percy""
Percy ""What about Aphrodite's husband?""
Annabeth "". . . well he isn't exactly handsome. Clever with his hands, and all, but Aphrodite isn't into brains and talent, you know?""

This is just one of many examples that really bothered me as a Christian mother who believes in complete fidelity in marriage. Not to mention that ALL of the children are conceived in this book by one of the God's sleeping with Girl/Boyfriends and not committing to the relationship. And then there is Percy's mother who got married ONLY to protect her son, not because she cared for his step dad at all. I know that all of you are probably rolling our eyes at my review but I just couldn't get over this attack on marriage. I STONGLEY feel that there are soooooooooooo many other books that teach values that are worth reading about.

Aside from the attack on marriage in this book I felt this book was subpar. I was not impressed with the story line and there were only a few pages where I was draw in (mostly the high action parts of the story line)."
84,85,2,"I can't say that I had high hopes for The Lightning Thief, but I was expecting something mildly entertaining that I could hand a pre-teen without any qualms. I chose to listen to the audiobook, and ended up putting it aside about halfway through.

The Plot: Percy gets in trouble at school. A lot. Percy gets attacked by an evil school teacher and defeats her with a pen-sword. Percy gets attacked by a minotaur and defeats him with his own horn. Percy finds out he's the son of one of the Greek gods. Percy has some emotional issues with this. Percy finds out Zeus's thunderbolt has been stolen and it must be returned or VERY BAD THINGS will happen. Percy (who is twelve, btw) is sent to find the lighting bolt by a bunch of adults who think it's a great idea to send a kid to do something they can't. Danger, explosions, drama, etc, etc, win, YAY.

Pro: It was better than the movie.
Con: The movie was really, really terrible.
Pro: Percy's devotion to his mother is both admirable and touching.
Con: Percy is the most obnoxious young character I have read in a long time.
Pro: The Greek gods are cool!
Con: Well, they used to be. Riordan's version leaves them flat and utterly uncompelling.

While I can see why young readers would enjoy this novel, I can't say that I recommend it."
85,86,2,"Considering that I'll read anything that has anything to do with Greek mythology, it wasn't going to take me long to get around to reading this.

A fast-paced run through the pantheon of the gods and other mythic characters, dealing as it does with Percy - half-blood son of one of the big three (although it's staggeringly obvious who's son he is, I won't be mean and spoiler for any of those who haven't yet read it) as he discovers who he is and is sent on a quest to retrieve Zeus' stolen thunderbolt.

You can definitely tell that this is a book intended for young adults and the humour and writing style employed would be a good way of engaging with most young teenagers, but it all felt a little too superficial for me, and the way things were quickly encountered, despatched and then straight off to the next felt a little like the book itself had attention deficit disorder. That said, I did enjoy some of the incarnations of the gods, and trying to guess who was up next.

Great for teenagers, but I won't be concerning myself with reading any of the follow ups."
86,87,2,"Not very good.

This series is quite popular, but the first book was not very edifying. Positively, it gets you to hate evil, whether you find it in gods or mortals. The bad guys are really bad. You learn about the Greek gods in an entertaining way. It throws in lots of info about Greek mythology, actually bringing the whole story into modern day New York.

It brings the worldview, too. Gods are just stronger and bigger flawed humans. They fight each other so nothing is for sure in life, with their arbitrary plans always changing. Humans are pawns of the gods.

It's one thing to study this worldview, but another to assume its truth personally while identifying with the main character living it. Maybe helpful in an Ecclesiastes kind of way: experience how chaotic and uncertain life must feel for atheists or polytheistic pagans. No sure anchor.

Nah. Lots of better reading out there."
87,88,2,"2,5⭐️
não gostei o plot twist foi bem ruim e o final também.
dei duas estrelas e meia pq gostei dos personagens mas a história em si não me prendeu."
88,89,2,"I liked this book alot. The concept was fantastic, and it's probably one of the only fantasy books i like. However, i think it could have been executed better. The story was fun, fast paced, and exciting, but i thought some of the ideas were silly and/or offensive. It feels to my like it implys that dyslexics are dyslexic because they are semi-immortal people who are being hunted down by monsters. It insults people with dyslexia and ADHD. At least, it feels like that to me. The chapter titles are FANTASTIC, the speech is funny, and the ideas are great, but it's just not perfect. I would easly recommend this book to anybody.

EDIT: 5 years or so later I'm keeping this review up since its seemingly the only in-depth review I've ever written AND I love the fact that I was totally calling out casual ableism in 8th grade"
89,90,2,"Some young adult books appeal to both kids and adults, some should just be read by kids. I think this one falls into the latter category. It was definitely action packed, but I was bored by most of the action. I wanted character development and deeper moral questions. The jokes felt cheap and forced to me, but I could imagine my nieces reading them and cracking up. I was also annoyed by the way it seemed to copy the Harry Potter series and annoyed that Percy continually mentioned his dyslexia and ADHD even in the midst of battling monsters and gods. But at the same time I can see that its a good book to appeal to kids and teach them Greek mythology.

Thanks to my niece Sofie for lending me her copy of this book. Don't worry Sofie, I didn't lose your page!"
90,91,2,"My 9-yr-old nephew loved this series, and as I was reading it I could understand why. There's plenty of action and adventure, and the pacing jumps from action to action. As an adult, I did find it mildly entertaining, but I also found my mind drifting. For me, action on its own is too shallow. I need character development and relationships that evolve. I need characters who think a little bit. As a child, I enjoyed books that included those aspects as well, though, so I don't believe it's just that I've grown up. I never was a boy, so maybe that's it.

I did try starting the second book, but the action took right off again and I realized that I just wasn't interested enough. It made me tired."
91,92,2,"As much as I love Greek mythology themed books I didn't like this book as much as I thought. I had really high expectations because almost everyone loves these books and I've heard nothing but great things and well for me I didn't really like it. I did find it interesting and different & the storytelling was great but for some reason I didn't connect to the book. Maybe because the writing was just a little too simple for me and youngish. I don't think I will be continuing on with the series, I just don't see the point in continuing if I didn't love it. I just think this book was a little to young for me, I don't know, I am an old soul, so. And I am actually mad at myself that I didn't like it as much as I'd hoped. But I do see why people like this series, I guess it's just not for me."
92,93,2,"Hace bastante tiempo tenía ganas de leer éste libro porque siempre lo comparan con Harry Potter y soy muy fan de esa saga.
Ahora por fin lo terminé de leer y creo que esperaba más de este primer libro.
De todas formas me gustó porque se aprende bastante de mitología y además, me incentivó a buscar más información por mi cuenta. También es bastante gracioso, cosa que lo hacía menos denso por momentos porque me costaba muchísimo seguir con la lectura y no dejarlo.
Lo que sí, terminé antes ""Las pruebas de Apolo"" (aunque digan que no es recomendable por los spoilers, ya sé, ya sé..) me gustó mucho más que ""El ladrón del rayo"" y creo que es la única razón por la que voy a seguir leyendo estos libros..."
93,94,2,"I didn't really like this book, i think that the movie is better. The characters were good, but i think the real reason that i didn't like this book too much was because it was recommended for 12 year old boys, and for starters, i'm a girl, and i'm older than 12. So i think i might have enjoyed it better if i read them younger, but...
It was sooooo different from the movie, that i'm not even going to start. i think, like, two of the things were the same, but anyway. The directers from the movie had a different (And in my opinion, better.) idea for the story.


I recommend this book for people who liked the Harry Potter series, Teen Fantasy fiction and Greek gods."
94,95,2,"Note: I'd rather give this a 2.5 star rating, but that's not an option.

So, Percy Jackson. I made the mistake of reading this and expecting something, well, more mature and complex. Was it dramatic and surprising? No. Was it cute and funny? Yes.

I think, in order to fully grasp this book, one must approach it as it is, or read it while they are young. I was searching for epic plot-depth and mega character-development, but that's not this book. And that's okay.

The best part of the book? Percy and his mother's love of blue food. That stuck with me. I made blue chocolate-chip cookies, and they were fabulous.

Rating: PG"
95,96,2,"I can't say I read the book completely since I was reading a page and skipping the next 10, but oh well. I'm not a fantasy book fan therefore this was one of the most boring books I've read. I don't like the concept of unrealistic stuff such as dragons, and super powered gods. It has been recommended for me many times, so I thought I should give it another try. I tried reading as much as possible because it's not fair to give my review on it without reading the whole book, but I have failed. I should never attempt to read fantasy again."
96,97,2,"I was so disappointed by how little I felt for this book. I may have enjoyed it more if I read it first when I was younger, but when I read it I couldn't get past what felt like underdeveloped characters. They weren't even necessarily underdeveloped, but there was an emotional complexity I found very lacking. Now, I understand this book is for children, but I still found some of the writing felt too empty and was missing depth. A lot of the lines in the book struck me as unoriginal. The storyline was interesting, but the execution failed to captivate me."
97,98,2,"The first book in the Percy Jackson series is a fast moving, action packed YA novel that makes for some fun reading. I read it at the same time as my daughter (I like to read what she is reading), and it does have some great moments. Even though I know it's a fantasy novel, I had a hard time getting into a world in which the Greek gods are a reality and that there a large numbers of demigods running around because they keep having children. It was a fun, quick read though."
98,99,2,"A fun first installment in a series I'm only just getting around to! I don't really love urban fantasy/low fantasy, but this was innocent and charming enough that I'll read on in the series. I like the naive, earnest nature of the characters and enjoyed the way that mythology was woven into the story. Definitely rough on the writing and plotting aspects but I'm hoping it'll improve with the next book."
99,100,2,"Okej nej. Denna förstår jag inte. Två pojkar där den ena sägs vara ""den rätta"", den andra inte lika smart och en flicka som är super smart. Låter bekant. De ska föreställa att vara 12 år och det stämmer inte överens med hur de resonerar men samtidigt förstår jag inte hur de kan vara så långsamma på att addera två och två. Så tråkigt eftersom många tycker om den. Känner mig tvungen att läsa vidare på serien bara för att se om den går att räddas."
100,101,2,"This is a fine book for kids, and I think I would have enjoyed reading it out loud, but my kids are old enough to read their own books now. They both liked this series, and I appreciate the fact that it piqued my younger son's interest in Greek mythology.

As far as my personal reading experience, I didn't find here whatever magic makes the Harry Potter books transcend the YA category."
101,102,2,Dili daha önce okunan diğer kitaplardan sonra çok basit gelse de çeviri gayet akıcı ve keyif verici olmuş. Fantastik romanlara yeni 'giriş' yapan ve yaşı ufak kişilere tavsiye edebilirim.

102,103,2,"C'est vrai que ça fait HP à la sauce greco-romaine... j'adore la mythologie alors je signe pour cette série! Par contre pas mal d'incohérences et de précipitation pour ce premier tome, j'attends de voir la suite!"

Gaaah, I am so disappointed and sad.



The ""Percy Jackson"" series has been on my to-read list for far too long, and honestly, I was expecting to love this.

I mean, a fantasy world based on Greek mythology?

Yes, please!

The gods running around being horn dogs and creating a whole bunch of confused demi-gods?

Yes, please!

A young main character who has to venture out on a dangerous quest to save the immortal world from civil war?

Yes, please and thank you.



Sadly, the book is sooo poorly written.



The plot moves at about a hundred miles an hour, leaving almost no space at all between the crazy action scenes, and no space for the characters to properly develop.

Additionally, the believability of the plot hinges on so many premises that are depressingly poorly worked out.

When creating a world that needs saving by an eleven year-old, you really need to create some rules and boundaries for that world that make a child's quest believable. Riordan, sadly, fails here. There is a whole cornucopia of plot holes that show Riordan simply hasn't spent enough time building his story.

Everything is also too easy for our heroes. Percy, particularly, who is entirely inexperienced (and spends less than a week training before his quest begins), should experience more difficulties in dealing with gods and supernatural beings who have, quite literally, been around for several millennia. If these beings are so easily tricked or beaten by eleven year-olds, they lose most of their ability to frighten and end up being comical rather than scary.

This is a problem that saps most of the tension out of the book, because you aren't actually worried that the heroes might fail.



The characters aren't too bad, but, as mentioned above, there isn't enough time to get to know them in between the constant action sequences.

Additionally, Riordan's trio of youngsters has a few too many similarities with another famous trio.

A troubled, black-haired hero thrown into a magical world of which he has previously been ignorant? A slightly comical best friend who, despite fears and misgivings, finds his courage and joins the hero in his adventures? A brainy girl without whose knowledge the quest cannot succeed?



The similarities to Harry Potter don't end here, and it's a little frustrating that Riordan didn't try just a liiittle bit harder at lending his characters some originality.

That being said, the dynamic between the three is entertaining, and I do think they work well as a literary trio.



The world is intriguing, but desperately needs more building up, and it also needs more clear-cut rules and limits.

There are, for instance, obviously limits to the gods' powers, but these limits are not made clear, and, as a result, their need for ""heroes"" to do their work for them becomes less than believable.

I the idea of bringing Greek mythology into the 21st century, but again, the whole concept simply isn't sufficiently built up. And the excuse for the gods' move to the US was flimsy.



Riordan's prose was probably my favourite part of this. It's not the most interesting thing in the world, but it's quippy and entertaining, and the writing flows really well.

To sum up, I feel like this first instalment in the ""Percy Jackson"" series would have benefited greatly from an editor who sat Riordan down and went, ""Look, I get that you like action sequences. But why don't we cut about five of them and make some room for proper world building and character development? Not to mention give your main character some time to get to know the ropes of the magical world he's about to be flung into, thus lending his quest a smidge of believability?""

All that being said, I do still think I'm going to continue to give this series a chance. Perhaps some of the problems that tripped me up in this instalment are dealt with in future books?

If you've read this entire series, please feel free to leave me a comment and let me know how this first book compares to the others in terms of the issues I've mentioned."

_____________________________

Don't ask me what my problem is, I don't know myself. In simplest words.. I don't like this book.

And I wanna cry about it myself because it was supposed to be my next favorite fantasy series after HP. I understand I didn't like the other series I tried to read (TOG), but this was Percy Jackson.. a bestseller. WTH!?

OK.. Let's get down to it.. Through the first 25-35% of the book.. I knew it was awesome! Amazing! Everything I was waiting for! The narrative!! Percy was hilarious! He caught my attention! A gem! The unexpected wierd stuff being thrown in, which looked like a building of a strong set of surprises, plot, twists!! I anticipated magic and a lot of adventure! His mother.. I sympathized with that woman. Sure she went through a lot.. for his son and suffered loads of hardships. But then she died. And I was like, 'Okay!'

When he was at the camp, I thought ""There it goes! Building friends and enemies! For a whole year and drama!"" But no... Apparently there's gonna be a quest, cuz the-

GODS ARE FIGHTING!!
(or wanna fight)

And two of the most powerful gods hate him already. His father doesn't gives a fuck about him. And on this quest there's only two people he can keep along (why again??) One of them is a satyr, so not much power.. and he really can't protect well (though I build a soft spot for him) and other girl whom you met uh... 2 weeks ago (very much like Hermione) and I couldn't trust her for the first half : the prophecy.

So.. the stakes are high. We want our dead mother back. Go on a adventure! Hurrah!!

But now... The things I couldn't understand begins.. 

First of them being, what exactly do we have to do? What's a bolt, how does it looks like? Where is it? Who's gonna help us, if any help at all? What about the humans if we have to tackle some monsters at earth? Can we, humans, in front of them? And like... kill the monsters if we have to? We have no addresses, where are we supposed to go?? Where?? When?? And just in 10 DAYS!??

And now begins the wait.. it's like a chain. You make a mistake. You got a monster. You fight. You make another mistake. ((AND THE LAMEST MISTAKES!!!)) And there, a monster! Fight, repeat. It was so confusing! I didn't know when to be shocked. When to think things are serious and risky and they might go wrong. One after other, series of events kept coming making no sense, leading to no plot. And BAM! We are underworld! I-

No... And in underworld.. ""Hey! Let's walk around! Have a look at hell and heaven and then say Hi to Hades and go back home"" That sounds easy? It was. Easy peasy. None of the expectations that I built of stakes, because 'UNDERWORLD' sounds scary, nothing kept up.

Then the fight with Ares. I thought.. finally.. action atleast? And it started. And I laughed.
And it ended.

Luke talked.

There's a spider!

“Oops.. I am leaving to bring back Kronos who would kick Greek Gods ass, and you get stung by a spider and die. And oh.. there's a God in that building few steps away but who cares. You will die by a spider if not all the monsters from underworld could kill you.”

Atleast Mom's back!"
116,117,2,"Originally, I gave The Lightning Thief one star. I hated the book. It made no sense, Percy was stupid, I hated the gods and the mythology, and overall, I didn't think it was a very good book. It was closer to a Harry Potter Alternate Universe fanfiction than an actual published story. It seemed like the title should have been Harry Potter and the Lightning Thief. Fast forward two years and I decided to give this book another crack, since my tastes had expanded and I've learned my viewpoint on books can change.

The Lightning Thief is about young Percy Jackson. For as long as he's known, strange things have happened to him. Things suddenly make much more sense after his math teacher turns into a screeching harpy and he kills her with a pen/sword. With a guiding hand from his satyr friend Grover, Percy makes his way to Half-Blood Hill, where he finds out he is a half-god. Percy and his father are framed for stealing the unthinkable; Zeus's lightning bolt. Along with Annabeth (daughter of Athena) and Grover, Percy must make fulfill a quest to return the lightning bolt to Zeus before the summer solstice, less World War III break out.

Since I am much older than the target audience for this book, I will review it with a grain of salt. But I will also keep in mind that I know my younger self would probably have the same opinions as myself.



My goodness, I could not stand a lot of the characters in this book. This book felt like a middle aged man in the body of a young teen. In other words, very unrealistic. Percy is an idiot. Honestly, he is. As the reader, if the author wants you to figure things out, they should put you one step ahead of the main character. In The Lightning Thief, the reader is leaps and bounds ahead of Percy. We figure things out way before he does, and that makes him seem much dumber.

Annabeth is alright, though she isn't as smart as she could be. Her plans aren't especially genius, and she spends a lot of the book not really doing anything. She's just the female character that sometimes says something smart. Although she was in most of the book, it didn't feel like it.

Grover was irritating. I couldn't stand him. He's obviously supposed to be the witty, funny sidekick, but he's just annoying most of the time. Like when he's sleeping and yells ""food"". That's not really funny. Not to mention he eats tin cans. Even though he's sort of a goat boy, goats don't eat garbage a lot. They actually never eat garbage like Grover does.

The gods were actually written alright. They were just as narcissistic, arrogant, rude, and hypocritical as in the original Greek myths. Although there was less rape and murder than I've come to expect from the Greek gods, it was still alright. I understand Riordan was trying to make this a child friendly version of our favorite raping, murdering gods from Greece.



Like I said before, this book just seems like a Harry Potter AU. Percy is obviously Harry, the main protagonist, Annabeth is Hermione, the brain in the trio, and Grover is Ron, the stomach, comic relief, and sometimes savior. Overall, I can understand why a lot of people like the book. Its a new idea in YA that hasn't really been done before. But there are very big things that made me side eye the plot. There were a lot of stupid things.

For one, there are things that just don't make sense. For example, things like Percy being kicked out of numerous schools. It's obvious that he's just an accident prone boy, not a juvenile. I feel like this is Riordan trying to give Percy a tragic backstory and failing miserably. Other things are simply illogical, like why would the Saratoga have cannons that are fully loaded available for the public to touch. Or, at the museum, where where all of the security guards? There were children stealing and harassing people, yet not a guard to be found.

There are a lot more examples that I don't feel like listing because there are so many. And they just don't make sense, even for a book about half-bloods and gods.

The biggest thing about plot that irked me was the fact that Riordan throws science out of the window. Things that are scientifically proven, are because of the gods. The sea and its waves? Not gravity from the moon, but Poseidon. The changing of the seasons? Not Earth being on an axis, nope, it's Persephone. With the magic in Harry Potter, I was fine with, because they didn't change the rules of science, magic was just an exception to the rules of science. With Percy Jackson there is no science! Just gods, and that is really irritating.



While I do think that Percy is an idiot, I have to admit that Riordan did a good job on the first person point of view. Many authors don't use it correctly. First person should give the main character a certain voice, which Riordan does very well. Nowadays, authors are writing in first POV in a sort of omnipresent way. In Percy Jackson Percy has his own voice, and anything he doesn't know, the reader doesn't know unless they come upon the information themselves.



Very rarely nowadays are there characters who have disabilities. It's nice that Riordan has and entire book full of characters who have disabilities. It's especially heartening to know that Riordan's son has ADHD/dyslexia and he made Percy for him. Though I do like the idea, there are some flaws with it in the book. For example, you completely forget Percy has ADHD/dyslexia until he mentions it. Honestly, I don't think he actually has these disorders, but something similar to them. That would have been a better explanation. And a lot of things Percy talks about points to the fact that he's doesn't really have ADHD, just that he had ""battle aptitude"". Percy is anything but impulsive, though he does have some attention problems.

That's the other thing. With ADHD, children are distractible. If you really had ADHD, that would be a really bad thing to have in the middle of a fight.

And with the Dyslexia, why can half-bloods hear English perfectly fine? They can obviously hear Greek well enough to know it and translate it instinctively, so why do they not have troubles hearing. Like I said, it would have been better if someone in the book said that half-bloods have something close to ADHD/dyslexia, but not quite.



Overall, there were a lot of things I did not like in this book. There were some things that were very nice that I actually liked a lot. Like the ADHD/dyslexia. I can see the appeal of the book, but it's just not for me. There were too many things that I couldn't ignore that made the book undesirable in my opinion. I'd recommend the book to someone who liked Harry Potter and doesn't mind book flaws."
117,118,2,"I don't get it. How is this book not considered pure Harry Potter fanfiction?

The mother protecting her child from evil. A trio: the unknowing hero; the goofy male best friend; the intellectually superior girl. One of the evil creatures in this book is a snake woman with the power to petrify people just by looking at them.

I'm not angry about it being so like Harry Potter, I already knew it was, and it's a perfectly good story, but I am confused as to why it's so popular. There is just so much more going on in the Harry Potter books. How are you not, like me, completely underwhelmed?

Also, Harry Potter wasn't born with the ability to defeat his enemies, he didn't pull out some superpower during fights, he survived by having a great support system and slowly becoming aware of his abilities and his purpose. In comparison, . Percy doesn't train hard to be a good swordsman, he doesn't spend that much time at camp, he just naturally pulls out his inner swordsman when he most needs to because of his birthright ADHD.

And look, no shade to an author that turns a dyslexic kid with ADHD into a hero, kudos for doing that, but please, , also encourage achievements reached through strength and effort and actual hard work, not just through some intrinsic value that was there from the start.

. That is my main takeaway from this book and it is also why I won't be continuing the series.

As a farewell gift I'll treat you to my favourite horrible line from this book. You're welcome."
118,119,2,"2.5 stars

I feel a little mixed on this book. I originally picked it up when I was around 12, read the first chapter, and then proceeded to put it down for 16 years... and honestly I think I stand by that decision. I probably would have enjoyed it more when I was 12 considering that was when it would have been an ""age appropriate"" book for me so I'm trying not to be too hard on it. Though, I'm not sure this first book would have piqued my interest enough to get me into the series at that time anyway.

The writing is technically fine. I was a bit bored by the narrative structure of ""we meet a new person and are continuously shocked that they're actually a Greek myth"". Like I get this was for kids but do we really think these characters wouldn't have started to be a little skeptical at some point? Or that kids reading this aren't smart enough to also get a little tired of this?

Maybe it's because I'm a 28 year old living in 2023, but I have less of a tolerance for this sort of interpterion of the Greek Myths than I would have at 12 in the early 2000s. I have too much sympathy for Medusa and Hades and too much dislike for the Greek Gods themselves to really be able to side with them. Like we're supposed to think Zeus and Poseidon are the good guys when the plot is literally that they have sex with a bunch of human women and abandon their children? ... maybe the future of the series is going in this direction but I'm not sure I'm actually willing to find out after the first book.

Ultimately, I can see why this series was so popular when it was popular but I'm not sure it's aged as well as it could have."
119,120,2,"I could not help noticing that there were similarities to Harry Potter, especially when it comes to the three main characters: Annabeth likes to read, she is the daughter of Athena (goddess of wisdom) and she is a know-it-all: she’s Hermione. Grover is a timid guy whose input in the action is basically nonexistent but he’s the main character’s best friend: He’s Ron. And the kid with no skills whatsoever but special by birth (because he is the son of the god Poseidon) is Harry or Percy, whatever.

I don’t mind if Rick Riordan took the Harry Potter books as inspiration, but I feel like his characters are devoid of the bonds of friendship, loyalty, and fellowship that make Harry, Hermione, and Ron so likable and so close.

I felt like this book was a series of pointless events unfolding one after the other that had no real impact on the personality or the actions of the characters: Percy’s mom dies and he doesn’t shed a tear, the guys are deceived and almost killed by Medusa and they keep trusting strangers. It doesn’t make any sense.

I gave it 2 stars (not only one) because I want to avoid bias. Firstly, because it is possible that the reading of this book was a little more boring because I had to look up a good number of words and phrases because English is not my native language. Secondly, it wasn't all bad: I learned a good amount of greek mythology because every time a new god, goddess, or mythological creature was named, I would google it and read the myth.

In conclusion, it seems unlikely that I’ll finish the series. I didn’t even finish this book, I only read 55% of it."
120,121,2,"I think I am the only person in the world that didn't completely geek out and fall in love with this book.
I was incredibly bored most of the time and the only reason I read the entire thing instead of stopping after my 100 page rule is because I was trying so hard to figure out why everyone loved it so much.

I can't figure it out.

Percy was a whiny little baby most of the time, walking around with a (what I picture to be a whiny little nasally voice) all ""why won't you tell me anything? even though you told me not to, I'm going to say every single mythological creature's name out loud to create thunder... just to disobey you because I don't want to believe it, etc. etc.""
And if it's not whiny little Percy, its the evasiveness of all the other characters in the book. Hi, yes, you're important but we don't know why and we don't want to tell you either so just do as we say and we'll all pretend to like you.

So why I kept reading an additional 200 pages after that? gods know.

it didn't get any better

I wish I could have my Friday back

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go yell ""STELLA"" outside and hope Marlon Brando falls from the sky, because that's how things seem to work in Percy Jackson's w0rld, right?"
121,122,2,"I loved this series as a teen. Coming back to it as an adult, nowhere near as good (not that it should be the same as when I had the imagination of my youth)! However, I have seen lots of comparisons between this series and Harry Potter, some even saying this is a rip off of that series. I strongly disagree that it’s a ripoff. I mean, what heroes journey isn’t some version of the heroes journey before?

That being said, comparing this start to a series to the start of Harry Potter, this book just lacks. The dialogue isn’t just childish, I can handle childish in a child’s book. It’s just plain boring and spoon fed. The story was rushed and didn’t seem very coherent or well thought out.

As a yearly reader of the Harry Potter series, each time I return to the Philosophers Stone, I’m immediately brought into a magical world that seems so well formed. The dialogue is intentional, the relationships seem genuine and real, and it stands the test of time (it’s ability to be read and reread never ruins the magic).

I am going to continue on my quest to read this series through once again, but I just can’t help but be nervous that the rest of the series will continue to have these same issues. Here’s to hoping!"
122,123,2,"Ahora puedo asegurar que el cliché del Elegido que no tiene ni la más minima idea de quien es y de la misma forma no tiene entrenamiento alguno no es lo mio.
Ahora bien , Tenia muchísimas ganas de leer a Percy Jackson he escuchado buenas reseñas pero este libro no fue lo mío . La mayor parte de la lectura se me hizo tediosa y un poco arrogante , siempre que iba a pasar algo interesante o se daria una información valiosa algo debía pasar y te dejaban con la voca seca.
Todo era muy obvio, Percy movía el agua y el campamento era tipo ummmmm creo que eres hijo de Apolo . Además la mayoria de los enemigos eran tan evidentes cómo la típica mujer con los ojos rojos y uñas largas quien se encontraba en un lugar nada confiable . El autor solo me estaba dando vueltas todo el libro y no me llevaba a lo que realmente me importaba. Debo aceptar que el final no me lo esperaba pero eso no cambio mi experiencia con el 87% de la lectura.

Aún asi no puedo negar que todo este mundo es maravilloso y el hilo con los dioses es toda una obra de arte , por esto le dare una oportunidad a los siguientes libros."

Disfruté Los Dioses del Olimpo porque me explicó cada dios, sus aventuras y desencuentros. Además fue chistoso escuchar a mi hijo identificar entre sus compañeros las personalidades de los dioses.
Sin embargo este libro me resultó confuso en redacción, aburrido por momentos, me extravié en la historia y no lo disfruté.
A veces me pasa así, las lecturas están hechas para una edad determinada."
124,125,2,"Me da la sensación de ser el Benjamin Button de las lecturas. Con 16-18 años leía como una posesa a Nora Roberts y Danielle Steel y ahora con casi 40 me pongo a leer Percy Jackson. Al revés del mundo xD

La verdad es que en su día perdí la oportunidad de leer historias como esta de Percy Jackson o Harry Potter y siempre he tenido esa espinita. He querido corregir eso pero me doy cuenta que ya es tarde. Seguro que si este libro lo hubiera leído años atrás lo habría disfrutado más. Fallo mío por no haberlo leído cuando tocaba.
Seguramente lo intente también con Harry Potter, a ver si con él tengo más suerte."
125,126,2,"This may be super unfair because there's not anything specifically bad about this book, it's just.....look....he's a 12 year old who with zero training, learns that gods exist and 2 minutes later believes it and starts killing monsters with very little trouble. Rips a horn off a goddamned minotaur for goodness sake. Like on page 30. Harry Potter had 6 books of education and 100% accidental success before he ever went in to really fight. Unfair comparison obviously but they were the same age. And both had a smart female side kick and a useless 3rd wheel. ( Ron and a goat )"

127,128,2,"A weak replication of Harry Potter. Maybe if i've read Harry Potter in my current age i would have also thought it was too plain.

And why Gods are so dull in this book?"

I was so eh about this book. I don’t like the narrator at all. I know the MC is supposed to be a 12 y/o boy, but the narration sucks.

I just had this audiobook on as background sound while doing chores. I couldn’t make myself pay attention to everything.

165,166,2,"There are definitely spoilers and some lost marbles in this review, so beware.

Look I get that it’s a book for children, but media being “for children” doesn’t make it exempt from criticism. That argument really doesn’t work for me, especially seeing as how easily influenced children are and how they learn parts of their values and mindsets through the media they consume. Something for children should be good no matter how little critical thinking you think they might have, those little information sponges deserve only the best.

Anyway.

I’ve been wanting to read this book FOREVER, but it is so insanely popular that you basically have to fight over it in the library. Sadly it wasn’t worth the trouble as I really didn’t enjoy it.

The writing and pacing are fine, but everything is so LOOSE and AIMLESS. There are so many things that either don’t get explained well – if at all – or the author brings up something that never comes up again. Was it ever explained why monsters hunt halfbloods? Did the Fates in the beginning matter, at all? Why did Annabeth take Aphrodite’s scarf, why was it there at all if it isn’t important to the plot? Now I’m aware that all of this could be revealed in the next books in the series, but … why bother at this point? None of those things are intriguing enough to keep me reading.

The characters are downright horrendous. Percy is an annoying brat, but with that he has the most personality of everyone else in the book. Speaking of them, I can’t believe how long it took everyone to realise he’s the son of Poseidon. Like his water powers aren’t enough of an indicator? But just to make sure really gets it, the trident symbol floats over Percy’s head once water touches him – once. Only that one time. Never before, never again.
I don’t know what the point of Annabeth and Grover was, at all. Especially Annabeth. She’s there to be a love interest, I suppose? And to tame Cerberus, who for some reason (plot convenience) listens to her. Grover actually does things, but would be utterly useless if it weren’t for the flying shoes. Great guardian, that one. Why does he eat cans again..? Is that a goat thing?

This might be a pet peeve, but I utterly hate the generalisation. All “bully” characters are ugly and dumb, and an entire group of them is also related to Ares because obviously the lust for fights is running in their blood, that is an inheritable trait after all. Annabeth is the daughter of Athena, that makes her smart, and nothing else. Underworld creatures are all evil, because Underworld, duh. The guy with the scar is a bad guy, who would have thunk. There is no nuance whatsoever.
I guess that is actually a very common theme in children’s media because it’s very easy to get, but I honestly don’t think children are incapable of understanding characters with a little more depth than that.

Another pet peeve is that all of this is taking place in the USA because it’s the new centre of culture or whatever. The Olymp being in the Empire State Building is one of the silliest things I have ever seen. You could have made it omnipresent like Heaven, with several entrances all over the world and half bloods coming from all kinds of cultures and countries, but nooo it has to be made US centric, because of course.

Also, last but not least I need to talk about how they just casually killed four people in the end – three of them completely innocent from what we know – and then . H o l y s h i t. Why yes children, if somebody is mean to you, it is okay to kill them, you completely have the moral high ground there. Remember that. Also how it was just done so nonchalantly. As if nobody would realise four people disappearing without a trace. Those guys had FAMILY. WTF.

Uh so, yeah, I did not like this book, I am not going to read any of the others. I understand that people like the concept and to think who could be there godly parent, and I am glad they find joy in this. But I really just … I can’t."

Maybe it's because I had already seen the horrible movie version, or maybe because it felt like a mediocre Harry Potter rip-off about illegitimate children (fun! explain that to your kids.). I think my daughter loved it because she read it when she was a middle-grader (is that a word?) and was really into Greek myths. I like the myths too, but I couldn't get past how dumb these kids were. Monsters are everywhere and they are after us, but let's go try out these free hamburgers from this strange woman... Guess I'm not the target audience for this book. I read it for my reading challenge ""over 1 million ratings on Goodreads"" so at least I can check that box and move on."

169,170,2,"In my ongoing research of novels: both bestselling and good, I figured I should give this one a try. Sure it's for a young audience, but I'm also a big Greek history buff.

Hmmm. The voice is engaging, and it's certainly easy to read. The idea is great. The characters fine, not good but fine. The writing is stiff, and the plotting... oh the plotting is pretty awful. I really don't understand why it sold so well. Perhaps it's a vaguely educational angle?

himself is likable, although he is unrealistically brave in this just-go-for-it-because-I-know-as-protagonist-I'll-win way. The rest of the characters are pretty one dimensional, although they do fulfill the requisite positions.

The flip style is good, but not exactly ground breaking, and the sentences are clunky.

I'm a stickler for accuracy with regard to mythology. But mostly, that part isn't too bad. Sure he completely goofed , as they are hybridized horse people, not related to goats (although they are partial to the beasts). . And on a related note, was lamely portrayed, missing out on any of the interesting nuances and dichotomies of the god. That's the name of the game for this book -- shy on nuance. Sure he throws in all sorts of figures from , but very little of their subtle and interesting character is retained. But the modernized updates are sometimes fun. Even so, this wasn't my big problem with the book.

The plot. The premise of modern day child of the gods is great. The overall arc of the plot is fine, that a war of the gods is brewing. It's just they way the main quest is actually architected. The middle 50% of the book consists of a series of encounters with monsters literally concatenated with nary a thought as to connection or relevance to the overall story. In fact, you could delete quite a few of them and never notice. This is always bad writing. If a scene can be deleted without incident, well then, it probably should've been. The overall taste we're left with is one of ludicrous coincidence, where everything just happens to the hero.

Then we get to the end. Can we say cheesy melodrama. There's no real menace, or challenge. Things just kind of happen. Mostly the hero solves them by whipping out his sword disguised as a pen. It all works out. It didn't have to be this way. is much better plotted.

Now I have to see the movie and compare. This may be a chore. I wonder if the series gets better, but I don't have the interest to find out."
170,171,2,"So I finish my last final exam and instead of packing for Spring Break like a normal human being, I instead go and get drunk, toddle home, and crack open a box set of Percy Jackson books which I proceed to read while eating stale marshmallows. Because I'm a nerd. And because when I'm drunk, children's literature is one of the few things I can read and sort of remember. After restarting the next morning (this time nursing a hangover), I have come to the following conclusions:

1) I am going to see this movie.
2) What a terribly repetitive book.
3) Greek mythology is badass.

To elaborate: Percy Jackson (and the Olympians, #1--- how fun to get to something after they've written books 2-through-god-knows-what) was an excellent way to spend a hungover morning. The writing is subpar (to be expected as it's narrated by an eleven-year old boy), the characters aren't particularly complex (ideal for film-making), and the plot is horrifically repetitive (Percy goes on a quest; he encounters a dozen or so mythological creatures who are out to get him; he ignores a gut feeling that said disguised mythological creature is out to get him; he then fights his way out of it. lather, rinse, repeat). Yet the premise is pretty neat. I remember reading a Choose Your Own Adventure in 3rd grade that involved a scion of the Olympians running through a flip-to-this-page maze of challenges, and that's essentially what happens to Percy. Son of Poseidon, he discovers his heritage and traipses along with Greek myths-become-modern-day-characters to recover a stolen lightening bolt. Promises of sequels, movie deals, and a scary prophesy follow. Riordan ain't no Rowling, but he's not a total hack either. It's nice to see there is a generation rediscovering these myths through Riordan's shiny, action-packed lens.

Tips-o-the-Hat:
-Percy is kind of sweet. Throughout the book, he notices that evil characters need love too. Cerberus is just a lonely pup who wants to play ball and even Hades would just like some peace. It's a nice touch and lends some depth to ""good"" and ""evil"".
-Riordan pulls out some nifty details. Special points to the smell of a minotaur, the way a satyr would wear shoes, and a forcefully sobered (and appropriately pissy) Dionysus.
-Poignant and creepy imagery. The fates knit a giant sock at a roadside fruit stand in the Southwest. Styx is polluted with eons' worth of human detritus (dreams, hopes) cast off as the dead are ferried across. A hotel Lotus that traps kids of eternity with the lure of video games.
-Side story of Percy's single mother and her abusive husband.
-The entrance to hell is in LA.

Shakes-o-My-Fist:
-Daugther of Athena. Wasn't she a virgin? Jesus? Bueler?
-Percy's kind of a nard. How many times does he have to be duped? I'm no 10 year old reader, but come on-- even they must be bored.

I scoff, but books two and three are on my nightstand. And Clash of the Titans is about to hit theaters. Yesssss.


Megan Lebow: I keep thinking back to that summer at SUP when you taught the mythology curriculum and your super-nerd children would play Greek mythology at the pool. ""I am Poseidon, lord of the sea!!!"""
171,172,2,"This book reads at about the difficulty level and intensity of a Goosebumps selection with a higher page count. I would say it is written to cater to young readers because I have a hard time believing it fits into a young adult category. Whatever fun there is to be had by a more developed reader could be very well overshadowed by the large amount of muck which gets in the way.

The good: It is highly action oriented. Literally every chapter involves a battle with some monster or entity from the Greek pantheon's roster of baddies. The Greek pantheon alone is fun to deal with even in this sort of watered down and desanctified manner. It is easy to slide right through as the action never really lets up and there is nothing overly boring or tedious to wade through.

The bad: It isn't original in its base framework. Extremely predictable. The entire setup parallels Harry Potter so much that it is hard not to shake your head at the obvious template usage. The ancient epic monsters and gods all seem on the same level as the hero(a child). The writing is silly and often ridiculous. The hero doesn't make sense. He is 12(ish) and acts like he was plucked straight out of a teen angst movie from the 1980s. It is all entirely convenient and even suffers from an awful ""band-aid"" ending (here you go, all better).

If you are suitably young enough and/or your reading skills are relatively undeveloped this book would be excellent for you. If you can't seem to choke down enough Goosebumps or Harry Potter then this book will work for you. If you are into ancient mythologies you might dig this. If you are looking for something silly and relaxing that you could enjoy shaking your head at, this will do. If you were ever a fan of (the stupidly silly )Hercules: The Legendary Journeys or Xena, Warrior Princess you might just love this book.

My largest complaints about the book were directed more at choices by the author to portray real circumstances and conditions as laughable or admirable. His casual throwing around of ADHD and dyslexia as amusing or admirable conditions is a little concerning. His attempt to idolize an F student as a great hero to a young population of readers is also a little off-putting.
Aside from that a few things occur which really don't make sense at all, such as the disparity between Greek gods who adapt with the times and seem to flow with ""Western Civilization"", but seem to have some inherent ancient Greek to them which they seem to stick to for no apparent reason other than that is the culture which worshiped them.

Can't say that I found the experience more painful than it was enjoyable."
172,173,2,"What if the Greek gods were alive and well? What if Olympus moved from place to place and wherever it stopped became the new center of western civilization? What if they kept canoodling with mortals and produced flocks of demigods who were especial targets for attack by monsters and other gods? What if a nefarious someone tried to whip up war between the gods and used one of these demigods as a patsy? These are all questions that add up to a fascinating concept. However, the unimaginative, thoroughly derivative structure of this book makes it little more than a fairly forgettable Harry Potter clone. The plot was constructed from Rowling's formula with the same skill of a sixth grader plagiarizing a Wikipedia entry: trio of children (everyman boy hero, brainy girl, and goofy sidekick with a heart of gold) from a training ground for speshul snowflakes go on a quest and find a great artifact, with only the skimpiest number of changes to distinguish itself. This book came out during the ascension of Potter Mania, and it shows.

My biggest problem with Percy Jackson as a protagonist is also present in the Potter source material. In Rowling's world, the characters are almost entirely determined by accidents of birth, though she at least pays lip-service to self-determination. Removing a hero's ability to choose the heroic path makes him or her into an object that is thrust from setpiece to setpiece rather than a subject. Riordan gives Percy choices that aren't really choices at all (e.g., ""go on this quest, or I'll turn you into a dolphin,"" or ""go face monsters in the real world or stay here with no friends""), his path was determined at conception and shaped by a few convenient prophecies along the way, all of which makes him a hero so bland that no amount of wisecracking can make up for it.

All these shortfallings of originality could be forgiven if the writing had transcended the source, or if the author had taken the concepts popularized by Rowling and somehow made them better. But the clunky dialogue and sparse characterization, which aim for a balance between the contemporary (hip) and the allegorical (bad-ass), come across as pompous and silly.

I will emphasize again that the concept of these books is good, and if you're looking for literary Methadone to help ease you out of Harry Potter withdrawal or a quick, entertaining read, then you've found it. If you're looking for imaginative, well-written YA fantasy, I strongly suggest you pick up a book by Cornelia Funke, Ursula le Guin, or Kate Di Camillo instead of this one."
173,174,2,"Damn, this book is weird! I was looking for an alternative to the Harry Potter-series which I absolutely adore and thus found my way to the first Percy Jackson book, since nearly all reviews here on goodreads are raving. But I wanted to read an alternative to Harry Potter, not a copy!
It is really hard to read this book without thinking how strongly Riordan copies J.K. Rowling. But whereas she has a really, really interesting style of writing, tied in with magnificent plotting and great characters, this book just falls flat in all these regards. This can already be seen by looking at the first sentences - Harry Potter starts with „“ Isn’t this pure genius? If you would not know that this book is about magicians and about a guy named Harry Potter, you would just think „Duh?“, but weirdly enough it still creates a strong sense of excitement because it is all normal and thus, it is implicitly stated that these things are about to change.
Now here’s the first sentence of Percy Jackson: „“ It is just too plain, too straight-forward to ever create any suspension. The whole book possesses absolutely no sense of nuance.

Talking about nuancing: There are some really lunatic and cringe-worthy ideas in this book. Don’t believe me? How about these:
- WWII happened because the children of Zeus battled against the children of Hades. And Zeus’ children won.
- The Olympus is always above that place where the center of the occident resides at the moment. That’s why it is -of course- above the United States of America.
- The gods are having a lot to do - That’s why they chill out all day at the Olympus and need their children to do weird-ass quests for them.
- Percy’s best friend has legs and horns of a goat and bleats from time to time.
- Now, here comes the real kicker: Percy’s mother is living with a huge jackass who literally stinks. Later on, it is revealed that the bad guys can smell the half-bloods/demi-gods and that’s why Percy’s mother went for this stinking guy, so that his reek would cover up Percy’s smell. [WHAT THE ?!!?]


I still gave it two stars because I can see why some people like it: There are many action scenes, the plot -although clustered with plot-hoes- is very fast-paced and the book got a light chuckle out of me two or three times."
174,175,2,"The story behind Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief is probably more interesting than the novel itself: Rick Riordan made up stories for his dyslexic, attention-deficit son, transforming dyslexia and ADHD into veritible superpowers. Twisting the established practise of teaching young dyslexics Greek into a narrative where the protagonists can pick up Greek easily because they're the children of Greek Gods is a clever starting point for a book.

However, the novel feels flimsy, let down by an outrageously silly premise. Oh, sure, I read some books with outlandish premises when I was a kid, but it's difficult to suspend disbelief that the Olympians and their illegitimate children are wandering around in diners and water parks in the United States. It constantly feels like Riordan is desperately papering over the cracks of his unconvincing premise, filling in another (and another and another) plot hole with some narrative Polyfilla. It's made worse by the clumsy references to henotheism, positing that the existence of the Greek Gods does not preclude the existence of another all-powerful deity (obviously hoping to avoid hate mail from the Christian Right!).

Philip Pullman in made a similarly Homeric quest feel utterly real, despite its fantastical premise. That's my benchmark, and I'm afriad Riordan doesn't come close.

The novel's plotting is lumpy and episodic, relying on multiple characters carting around the to make it work. For instance, it takes an improbably long time for anyone to figure out that Percy might be the son of Poseidan, despite the fact that, on multiple occasions, he . For the reader, it's even more annoying, since the FRONT COVER shows Percy IN THE WATER.

I will give Riordan points for humour, since the book is funny in places (my favourite character is Grover, a satyr who can only play two tunes on his pipes: one by Mozart and one by Hilary Duff). Unfortunately, it's exactly Riordan's painstaking construction of comic situations that helps make the plot so riddled with diversions and distractions.

As I've said of children's books in the past: fifteen years ago, I might have given a pass, but the landscape of children's literature has changed, and if you're trying to compete with JK Rowling and Philip Pullman, you're gonna have to try a little bit harder."
175,176,2,"No. I did not enjoy this book.

I don't care about any of the characters. And it's funny how none of this kids act like kids at all. What is more they don't even feel like their own person. Its rather like they are the gods themselves not the offspring. I mean, just because your parents don't like each other does that mean the kids mustn't get along? WTF kind of a racist (familist?) camp is this.
Percy is completely devoid of personality or emotions. And the narrative is from his point of view. He is completely unfazed by any monster on strange and unnatural event around him. His mother ""dies"" in front of his eyes and there is no spec of sorrow or grief or anger in him after this fact. He learns who his father is (and that he is alive) and is just like 'OK, I have a father'. He meets him face to face for the first time in his life but has absolutely no emotional reaction to this. Not even curiosity. Why would there be any need for his approval. He is also a Gary Sue. In a span of 2 weeks he becomes this invincible hero with all the water-bending powers without even putting any effort to. It is also weird how we are told by him he got kicked out of school 6 times but never shown properly why. If it really wasn't his fault, there should be scenes to show us why we should root for him. Make us like him. I really don't understand why so many people praise this book series. It's just another chosen hero kid story trying to be a mystery novel (in a very broad sense). But the thing is Percy at the start of the book is the same as in the end. There was no character growth or development at all. He overcomes no real struggle. On the end when he is faced with the decision to stay just for the summer or whole year I genuinely didn't understand why that was even a question. Or why would it be a tough decision to make.

Also this ""wester civilisation"" that is praised to heavens in this book refers to the last 500 years since Europeans invaded the continent of what is now known as America with all the immigrants from every other part of the world. How exactly does this civilisation differ from the European in this last 500 years? How far east was Greece 2000 years ago? All the way to China?"
176,177,2,"I debated long and hard about whether to give this book 1 or 2 stars, but I decided on two because it was JUST good enough to force me to finish.

This book has a lot going against it: terrible writing, predictable plot, shallow characters, uneven pacing.

This book has only one thing going for it: an interesting idea that feels more and more, as I look back on it, like it was ripped off from Harry Potter.

Let's look at the similarities, shall we?

Boy discovers he is not normal and has extraordinary power, and that he is actually a demigod. He goes to a special summer camp where other people like him train to use their powers better, called Half-Blood Hill. Once at Half-Blood hill, the students are separated into separate cabins based on who their parents are. He has a special rivalry with another cabin called Ares. The houses play a game against each other called capture-the-flag, and the winner has their banners put up around the school. He goes on a mission to save the world with his two friends, Grover and Annabeth. They have an invisibility baseball cap. At the end of the story, the incarnation of evil is about to come back from hiding, named Kronos.

The main problem with this book, however, is the break-neck pace that allows for absolutely no character development, no moral development, and no depth for any emotion. It careens onward like the imaginations of a 10-year-old. The plot runs in excruciatingly predictable cycles, making what's about to happen so obvious that it makes you more impatient every moment.

But then again, I did finish the book. Why? Morbid curiosity. I had to see if I could predict every last detail from the very beginning, to see if I was right about the books biggest and final reveal. It turns out that I was, so that was a let-down."
177,178,2,"I picked up this book about two years ago, at age 12, because many of my friends were reading and recommending it. It seemed like a decently interesting concept for a novel, and the fact that it was so well recommended just made me more eager to read it.

When I borrowed this book from the library, I honestly tried to read it, but I could not get past the first few chapters. Maybe it's just because I'm an avid reader and usually read books for an older audience, but I found the writing to be nothing special, and the plot developments uninteresting and somewhat random. I usually stick to a book all the way through, no matter how much I dislike it, because most books get better later on. Maybe The Lightning Thief does - I just couldn't bear wasting my time to see.

For example, in the first chapter (SPOILER) his teacher randomly becomes a monster. What? This just didn't sit with me. There's this kid who seems pretty normal, and then out of the blue, his teacher becomes a monster and he manages to fight it off. Regardless, I stuck to the book for another few chapters, but nothing sucked me in. I just had a gut feeling as I read it that this was just kind of dumb.

I can see how this novel could possibly appeal to a younger audience (maybe around 4-5th grade), which is the only reason I gave this two stars rather than one. Perhaps had I read this at a younger age, I would have enjoyed it - I don't know. I may someday try to read this again, but so far I'm not inclined to.

Just to add, I can't fathom why this book, and the others in the series, all have at least four star ratings when so many other books which are much, much better have lower ratings on this site.

I don't personally recommend this book, though I'm sure some elementary/middle school students would enjoy it, especially if they're into myths and fantasy. (But if they're into fantasy, better to get them The Hobbit, which is absolutely fantastic.)"
178,179,2,"And so I've read a Rick Riordan book at last.

Okay, so I'm just gonna go ahead and state the things I liked and didn't like, and get this over with.

What I did fancy was:
1) The Greek mythology.
Duh?
I've always been fascinated by ancient civilizations. And since I knew very little about ancient Greece, I was very glad by the tons of information and the educational side to the book.

What I wasn't very fond of was:
1) Mr. Riordan picked the easy way when he wrote this book. I mean, the same old boring ""suspense"" where the author keeps answers from the protagonist over and over until you're at least 50 to 60 pages in.

2) A trio? Really? Again?
Let me guess, there'll be hero, a smart girl and a goofy sidekick.
I wonder where he got the inspiration for these characters.

3) The plot was very predictable (and childish, needless to say) especially towards the end.

4) What's more was how exhausting it was to read this book. There's 22 chapters total, and almost 22 fights. A fight per chapter. In a period of two weeks. The fight reaches a climax and resolves in the same page.
That's not fast pace, that's crap.
Who does that?

5) The writing was blekh. It didn't show any skills at all, it was like reading an article off a newspaper. A bad one to be precise.
Now I understand this series is middle grade. However, I've read a couple of children's books (, , and naturally ) and the writing was never this bland.

6) The first person narration didn't help at all. I'd prefer it if it were in third person, or with shifting POVs.

7) A god in khaki shorts and Hawaiian shirt.
Need I say more?

As I was reading, the rating kept hovering between 3 and 4, but as I reached the end, I couldn't put up with the ridiculousness anymore.
One wonders by which book Mr. Riordan decided to take a turn in the series and shift it to a more mature audience.

2 stars."
179,180,2,"It was...predictable. There are a lot of clues and hints and actually, when you think about it hard enough, while some characters get introduced, it's quite obvious - what's the title of the book? The Lightning Thief, and, do you suppose this ""lightning thief"" will be revealed on the next books? Possible but probably not. Halfway through you might be 90% sure, but then again you just get some hunches and you won't know until you read further 'til the end. ;D In any case, I guess it's predictable for me since this isn't really for my age group but, okay, it was entertaining at the least, and a very easy read. And I have to say some parts did surprise me. :D I'd have given it three stars, but, I have a reason why I didn't (at the end of my review, but it contains spoilers).
The ""sub""protagonists, Grover and Annabeth, are very likeable. IDK but I liked Grover most. Percy is quite likeable, too, and for a kid his age he's quite the smart guy, a kid ""worthy of Athena"" (okay I won't elaborate I don't want to spoil too much).
Plus points: the exposition of Percy's ""other"" world was very nice. Best part of the book for me. :D

There's just one thing that bothers me, though : did the lightning thief really intend to kill Percy, well I'm quite sure he did it on the woods away from camp, but STILL dryads (or the tree spirits) and naiads (water spirits) would be there to help Percy, RIGHT? And correct me if I'm wrong but aren't they the ones who saved him? So, does the BIG BAD boss (the thief's master) intend on telling the whole camp, and the whole Olympus, about his plan?? I mean, the lightning thief DID intend to kill Percy, but then again Percy WILL be saved by the spirits, and won't the spirits hear their conversation?? Quite the bugger, yes, enlighten me, please. :("
180,181,2,"Percy Jackson, a troubled dyslexic 12-year-old withADHD, finds out that he is a demigod after some unusual events. He ends up at Camp Half-Blood after his mother takes him to Montauk for the weekend but they get attacked by a Minotaur and she disappears. At the camp, he learns more about life as a demigod, eventually learning that Poseidon is his father. He is sent on a quest to find Zeus’s stolen lightning bolt with the help of Grover, a satyr, and Annabeth, a daughter of Athena. The story progresses as expected, adhering strongly to a Hero’s Journey storyline with a cliffhanger ending beckoning for the next book in the series.
I understand that the series is intensely popular with children, perhaps due to their lack of exposure to better literature. It is incredibly derivative and predictable. The characters are flat, boring and irritating. Percy himself is annoyingly bratty and Riordan spends more time forcefully telling rather than showing Percy’s personality. The novel is overall very choppy and disjointed, which really causes the novel to drag on forever. The fight scenes lack any suspense, it is obvious that the kids will succeed with hardly any trouble or loss. There is no question to their eventual triumph as they face each obstacle and that absence of tension bleeds the fun out of what could’ve have been a wonderful story.
Riordan goes for the punchline every time with his allusions and homages to the classical Greek literature, resulting in shallow and trite depictions of the various Gods, Goddesses and spirits. His treatment of the material makes it seem as though even he doesn’t believe his story is real, as though the author himself was unable to suspend the disbelief necessary for the novel and it is infectious. Also, why in the world does Athena have children?!?"
181,182,2,"This was quite fun but the picky reader in me was just not satisfied. Putting aside the existence of Greek gods, 'Lightning Thief' did not make sense.

There were just too many coincidences. Percy did throw in some hints about weird things happening before it was revealed that he was a demigod, but once he started his journey to the Underworld he technically ran into trouble with the monsters and gods around every bend he took. Law of attraction? Yeah, right. I mean, of all places in the jungle (or wherever, I could not deign to remember) how could he end up at Medusa's place? Of all hotels in L.A how could he end up going to the Lotus-eaters'? And of all shops in Santa Monica, how could he end up hiding at Procrustes's water bed shop? It was not like Medusa or old Crusty came stalking after him like the Minotaur or the Furies. Considering its much shorter length(?), this books was more infested with coincidences than any of Charles Dickens's works could be.

And it annoyed me that Percy, who was smart enough to help his friends out of the scrapes at the water theme park or the water bed shop, could not see more obvious facts that hang just inches before his eyes. Of course he was Poseidon's son! How else could he sprayed Clarisse with toilet water? Of course the traitor was Luke! For what other reasons should those stupid flying shoes malfunctioned in the Underworld? And of course the real enemy was Kronos the Titan! Those were just the blaring facts anyone in Percy Jackson's shoes could not miss. But Percy, was he in some state of denial?

It was fun, I would not deny that. I particularly liked Hades, he was just hilarious. But it still reminded me of Harry Potter. The awakening of the dark power, the name you cannot mention kind of thing. Whatever. Anyway, anyone knows any book like this but with Celtic mythology instead?"
182,183,2,"I thought that Rick Riordan was, for the most part, reasonably good at plot development, character development, world-building, and the writing style was easy to read. This is a good novel to teach children Greek mythology in a way they can remember easily. I still didn't feel a reason to continue after Percy Jackson & The Lightning Thief. I was really excited when the novel said that our protangonist, Percy, went to a school for students with disabilities, and that he had ADHD and Dyslexia. I absolutely despised of how Rick Riordan handled that, though.





I really didn't find this appropriate of Rick Riordan. I was mostly just very disappointed, because he really set it up to have a disabled hero, but then he erased it completely. This reminds me so much of the ""queer baiting"" in Sherlock BBC.

I don't know what happens in the rest of the series, but I'm strongly encouraging Rick Riordan to do some research on the conditions he wrote about and read some stories by actual disabled people."
183,184,2,"Maybe I’m just the wrong age for this series, but what a disappointment. It’s like Harry Potter without the memorable characters or immersive world-building, or (perhaps more accurately) a watered-down American Gods. Uneven pacing, dull characters, an ending that goes on and on…

Also—the Greek gods following the heart of “Western Civilization” reeks of white supremacy."
184,185,2,"I really wanted to like this book. Things I did like about it: the way Percy, the main character, sounded like a realistic 11 year old most of the time. It's sometimes really hard for a writer to get that as right as Riordan did. I also liked the idea behind writing a series about heroes/demigods, the children of gods/goddesses and mortals, which Riordan calls half-bloods. I just don't know if I liked how utterly predictable the entire first book was. Also, it reminded me way too much of Harry Potter, in almost a ""let's take the exact same plot and instead of magic, insert Greek mythology"" kind of way, but that may just be the original set up and the rest of the books will differentiate themselves into their own stories. I may just be completely the wrong audience for this, and that's okay, but I might give a later book in the series a try to see if I can get past what I don't like or if the plot becomes less easy to guess later on. I didn't even feel like I was guessing; I was really frustrated by things I already knew way before Percy did. It felt a little like waiting for Robert Langdon to solve mysteries, especially in the way he later mentions how obvious they were because of this fact or that fact after he finally solved them. Because Percy does that, too. Some kind of weird suspense plot device or something. I realize I'm an adult and this is a children's series, so maybe it's just not for me, although there are plenty of children's books I still love as an adult or have discovered as an adult and loved. I think school kids learning about Greek gods might really love this and make their learning it easier to take. I'd probably give it 2.5 or 2.75 stars if those were options, because at least it was fun, and I finished it. *shrug*"
185,186,2,
186,187,2,"Percy Jackson is a fandom I have dabbled in before. Like most people I have seen the films several times and thoroughly enjoyed them. However I feel as though watching the films ruined the book for me a little bit mostly because I knew what was coming. Despite this I was pleasantly surprised by the simplistic and informal writing style, it made the storyline easy to follow because of the lack of distracting embellishments. Normally I don't enjoy this style of writing, it tends to bore me a little, but it's nice to have an easy read every so often. A huge asset of this book was that I found the greek mythology extremely interesting and loved the way it was incorporated into the storyline."
187,188,2,
188,189,2,
189,190,2,"This book, unlike the Harry Potter books, is written exclusively for kids from about 10-15. The Greek mythological references are plain and straight-forward; I suppose that means Riordan assumes most kids don't know much about the mythology. The plot is ok, but I have to say that many of the scenarios, character roles and relationships, and events seem to be blatant lifts from Rowling. For example, when Percy shows up at ""Half-blood"" camp, one character says, ""Our new...celebrity."" Shades of Snape! Percy, Annabeth, and Grover share exactly the same relationship as Harry, Heromine, and Ron. I know that someone will say: ""Well, Riordan is simply using the mythic archetypes -- as did Rowling, Tolkien, Lewis, etc. But I would disagree. The archetypes are there, yes, but the specific fleshing out of the characters and situations doesn't strike me as fresh.

Having said all of that, I still enjoyed the book -- the plot moved well and the characters were distinct, if not unique. Ultimately, I found Percy Jackson himself a little too much of a troubled-kid stereotype. It was difficult to empathize with him, even though it was clear that that's what Riordan desired.

As for themes -- what does this first book ultimately say? That mom was right to borrow those ""tools"" from Percy and turn the stereotypical bad step dad (Smelly Gabe)into a stone statue? The book lacked the depth and invention of Rowling's novels, which I come to appreciate more and more the more I read other adolescent fantasy literature. Read the books, , or even the novels first."
190,191,2,"This book is full with nothing but cliche. Reading the novel is like verifying what was written by Joseph Campbell. Most of the plot were predictable and not getting anywhere complicated. The plots are solved easily by using deus ex machina in many forms, such as magical items, god appearing nowhere, dream, etc. Evertime the hero is in danger or a plot stalled, the writer will just insert ""magical item number X"" or insert random god to solve the problem. It's like Harry Potter with Dumbledore everywhere having emergency call so he could appear anytime to resolve the problem.

Some people might notice the similarity with Harry Potter, however it wouldn't be fair because hey it's archetypes. Every story basically have same plot with unlimited variation.

Is this book thrash? No absolutely not.

It's pretty enjoyable and won't get you bored easily. What is the recipe of its successfulness? In my opinion it's the writer's writing skill that execute such typical plot into an enjoyable reading. Reading this novel is like reading Naruto or one of these shonen manga, seriously the plot flow is too similar and straightforward that I almost gasped.

There are too much books about ""hero is lost prince, having journey to find magical item to save the world"", however Percy Jackson getting my attention because it's successfully revisited these typical storyline. This book is far from terrible. I have read worse books that I would throw only after reading the first paragraph because it's uninteresting.

Conclusion? This book is originally for children. Young adults shouldn't expect much about this one. The story is pretty much forgettable however enjoyable it is."
191,192,2,"Ok. Ok, so this wasn't as bad as I was afraid it would be, but it didn't exceed my expectations either. Meaning, this book is obviously attempting to complete the successful recipe of Harry Potter but it does not succeed because there is no recipe. Percy is not Harry and Annabeth is certainly not Hermione.
The idea of the gods and their half-blood children is actually nice, but to say that the kids' dyslexia is a result of a predisposed mind to understand Ancient Greek - come on! People are perfectly capable of learning Ancient Greek (or modern, for that matter) or Latin and still be able to learn English as well. And don't get me started on Mount Olympus being situated over the Empire State Building. I understand the need for writers to write about their own country as if it were the centre of the universe, but why then does he need to take Greek myths and relocate them? It would be as if borrowing the Nordic mythology and place it in South Korea or the Arthurian cycle and place it in Turkey! But I'm biased, being Greek and all so I won't say anything else on the matter.
One last thing - and this is a soar point for me -, why do characters say things like ""I've never seen her be like this"" (insert scared/frightened/angry etc.) when they only know each other for a week? Why do they say ""he told me this a long time ago"" - when it's only been five days??? What is this? Time goes differently for children, yes, but not like this.
Anyway, I did read this in just two days and I wanted to see what would happen even though I knew what that was - you could smell the end from the first thirty pages. Maybe it gets better in the next books? One could only hope."
192,193,2,"There were some things I found enjoyable about the central conceit, that Greek gods sire mortal children who are doomed to repeat those , but overall, I found Percy an unlikeable clod, and the over-reliance on coincidence and deux ex machina to be too great (even for a book based on the Greek works in which such endings do normally figure prominently -- c.f. every Greek play written). As a piece of escapist reading, this book would be more enjoyable if I found the protagonist more appealing, I suppose, but in any event, as a piece of ""young adult literature"" I do not entirely approve of the lessons it seems to impart (like the fact that all authority figures are, in fact, out to get you).

The work also reeks of a massive dose of Eurocentrism -- why are only the Greek gods still around in modern day America, and not, say, the Etruscan or Aztec gods? by Neil Gaiman does SUCH a better job of exploring this idea, and why some gods have power and others do not. Of course, that is a work for adults, but honestly, I think it's possible in the YA world, too. The series or the trilogy both do a significantly better job of exploring questions at the intersection of mythology and faith, at a level that younger readers can still appreciate."

194,195,2,"Trouble seems to follow Percy Jackson wherever he goes. It's not just the fact that he has ADHD and is a major target for school bullies. No, it's the small problem that he sees mythical monsters that no one else notices. Even worse, those monsters want to kill him. It turns out that Zeus's master bolt has been stolen, and some odd reason Percy is the main suspect. With loyal friends in tow, Percy sets out cross-country to catch a thief and save what is most precious to him, even as the ugliest and nastiest brutes of the ancient world follow in close pursuit. Suddenly, being kicked out of boarding school doesn't seem so bad.[return][return]I've had this in my to-read stack for six months and decided to read it since the movie trailer has been out. My feelings are mostly negative. It's a very fast read, and suspenseful. It's also very middle grade and ridiculously predictable. You can see every major plot twist coming from a hundred pages away. I like that Percy is a regular kid with ADHD, but comparisons to Harry Potter are unavoidable (complete with new versions of Hermione and Ron). The bad guys are all cardboard cut-outs without a shred of complexity.[return][return]If I was 11-year-old, I could have read this and enjoyed it, even with the major transparency of the plot. As an adult... eh. I'll buy the next books if I can find them at a thrift store and I'd like to see the movie version (would looks radically different with much older characters) eventually, but I'm in no rush."

★★☆☆☆

Over a year later, changing my rating to 2/5 stars. I know for sure that I was trying to be nice on this one because I knew how many people loved it and assumed I was missing something. But I really didn't enjoy this book much at all. If I tried it now, I think it would be a DNF. But the combination of its popularity and the fact that I was more patient with books a year ago made me finish it. Also, do NOT do the audiobook if you have other options. The narrator was the worst. Thank you and goodnight.

3.5 stars

This was an interesting experience for me. I always felt like I missed out on the Percy Jackson books, so I wanted to at least try the first book in the series. This was, by all means, an excellent book for grade school. I think I would have adored and obsessed over this series if I had read it earlier in life. That isn't to imply that I didn't like reading it now, but I could tell I wasn't getting as invested as I would have when I was younger. I also chose to listen to the audiobook, and I've had mixed experiences with those so far. If I'm not completely engrossed by the story, I find that my mind can wander and I won't retain nearly as many details as I would if I'd read a hard copy.

To me, this was probably a very comparable experience to those that didn't read Harry Potter growing up and decided to start it as adults. It unfortunately loses some of the wonder and magic that way. However, I do plan to eventually continue with Sea of Monsters with a hard copy or e-book to see if it changes my experience at all."
196,197,2,"This was aimed at a younger audience than I was expecting, although now that I look, I see it's for 9-12 year olds. Which makes sense.

Overall a fun read, with some modern twists on Greek mythology, like a motorcycle riding Ares and such. Some of these worked better than others for me, but certainly imaginative. The plot points are heavily overshadowed, so you may spend quite a bit of time waiting for the characters to catch up and figure things out. But this never got to the point where I was impatient or outright angry with the characters, so I didn't mind.

One complaint though, is the the lean towards writing for the ""reluctant reader"" which crops up now and then. Things like calling a field trip to the museum ""torture"" or listing opera as one of the tortures of the underworld. I see where this comes from, and maybe if it works for some that's great. Still, this kind of thing bothered me as a kid as well, when reading, art, and culture were knocked by the main character. By trying to relate to the struggling reader, it alienates the bookworm.

I also may be picky here, but I think this also shows up in the food they eat. Chocolate chip cookies, burgers, XXXL fries, Double Stuf Oreos... all ""Fried, greasy, excellent food,"" and a welcome relief from healthy grapes and bread. Call me old-fashioned, but I'd much rather my heroes be admirable role models whenever possible."
197,198,2,"Decent book, but sadly Percy was in it."
198,199,2,"I have decided to change my rating because it didn't really reflect my feelings for the book, and while it hurts me that it could have an impact (albeit a very small one) on the overall rating because I respect Rick Riordan waaaaay too much, I'm working under the assumption that he most definitely doesn't care about it.

2.5 stars, good but a bit too slow for my liking and also I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I was going to considering I really loved the film and it's been talked up by so many people whose opinions I trust. I'm aware I'm definitely not the target audience for it, but that's never stopped me before. That being said, I am continuing and will most likely finish the entire saga."
199,200,2,"I dont know why so many people are obsessed with this book and I really dont know how it bagged so many awards. Either people overrated this book or there is something seriously wrong with me. Since my friends believe I'm normal, I'll go with the former conclusion. And I'm not so pleased with me that I read till the last damn page.

Greek Mythology * Harry Potter - Imagination = The Lightning Thief

This book is a poor attempt at creating a series alternative to HP. If you try to bash me for comparing both, well you have to know that I can't help myself come across some scenes which were deeply influenced by HP. There are lot more shades of HP from the start till the end and you end up reading the worst version of Harry Potter(). The author has just flicked the greek characters() and sprouted them in a not-so-impressive plot with an immature narration. I think the children rhymes are more intricate than this book.

It lacks imagination to be of fantasy genre and too immature to tag it as YA. Overall a very crude book and I'm giving it 2 stars because after reading this I started liking Harry Potter more for its originality()."
200,201,2,"I had hard time reading this book because I find it lame. Awesome idea ruined in my opinion! I read its young adult book but I think its good for under 14 or so...!!!
Some people say ""If you like Harry Potter, you will probably like this book, too. "" But oh come on!!! Harry Potter was so much better than this I could understand all the characters better. I cant even with Percy Jackson character...he faced her mothers death like ""oh! I lost one of my stuffs. thats sad!lets find it again from underworld."" Thats your mother stupid boy show some real emotions so that I can believe that you are a real character!oh wait,you are not. Oooopsss...
Yeah the beginning was so lame and trying too hard that I was annoyed the whole time reading this book but I must admit if its not good at being a young adult fantasy book,It had some funny dialogues. Those parts cool me down a little bit that I could give it 2,5 stars form 5 stars in the end.
As others say ""The concept in itself is very creative. Son of a Greek god in modern times. He is dyslexic because he is meant to read ancient greek.""
If I have read this book in the age of 12 I could have become in love with it.Now I know,I must take it more easy if I want to read the other books of this series."
201,202,2,"The premise of envisioning the Olympian gods in the modern world was interesting, but the plot, characterization, and writing never launched beyond ""OK."" I felt that the author might have done more, but he chose to follow the safe conventions of modern children's writing: an adventure that children must undertake alone, the obligatory main character + smart girl + clumsy sidekick, a crisis that arises and is resolved in every chapter, slangy first-person narration, bits of underdeveloped interesting ideas glued on all over the place to add atmosphere . . . the list could go on. Perhaps I knew too much mythology, but I often knew pages before something was ""revealed"" what the author was trying to surprise his readers with. All this can be shrugged off as an overcritical adult opinion of a children's book, though, if the book actually has something of worth at the end of the frivolity. But I really didn't feel that had anything of this sort. None of the characters showed much development, and the conclusions that the book came to seemed mostly to be of the ""attempt hard things and believe in yourself"" type. It seems one could have done a lot more with a pantheon of gods and heroes standing by."
202,203,2,"I read this because my kid read it and loved it (and several other Riordan books--I think he's on his 8th one in the last month? He really loves them!). He wanted me to read it and love it, too. Read it I did. Love it I could not. I tried. And I tend to enjoy fantasy, Greek mythology, and YA lit, so I'm not sure what to say except that I found this... shallow. Maybe I'm too old or too aware of the world's stories (I recognize that this is written for middle-schoolers and that I am not one), but it felt to me like it had no layers at all, and precious little mystery. The plot is fine, but the way the characters are developed is basically that they're not. And when a ""secret"" is shared, it's shared--and by shared I mean told, not hinted at--over and over and over. It's a bit like being hit with a house. I had read somewhere that these books were right up there with Harry Potter, and while I didn't expect that to actually be true, I definitely expected more in the way of nuance and intrigue to go with the action. I'm going to let my son tell me about the rest of these books. I just can't read more. I'll say this, though--the story is action-y and potentially visually interesting, so I'm willing to try the movie versions."
203,204,2,"This was very exciting, the characters are very interesting and Rick manages to keep many characters involved in the book without making it confusing. I wish I had a Percy Jackson phase when i was younger smh"
204,205,2,"Ok, so this book is another derivative of Harry Potter, in perhaps the most obvious rip-off yet: same cast of crazy supernatural characters, same boarding school setting for the training of young magical heroes (in this case it's a summer camp, but it's basically Hogwarts moved into the open air), same worn out themes (our young hero is basically an orphan with behavioral problems who faces abandonment issues, duals with beings far more powerful than he which he somehow wins, begrudging respect and fear from the other magical students, vague prophesies, and a general feeling of loneliness from being an ""other"", etc, etc, etc).

In any case, despite the blatant near-plagiarism, there IS a reason Rawling's books sell so well: these factors make for an interesting story. The conceit of this book is that instead of magical, the beings are immortal: the story is set amidst Greek myths. The children at the camp are the offspring of mortals and gods. The action moves quickly and at an enjoyable pace. The bottom line is, while Riordan gets no credit for originality, children who are upset that the Potter books are at an end will eagerly take up this series."
205,206,2,"Many of the students at my school love this book, and it's easy to see why: it's about a dyslexic, ADHD middle schooler who learns that he is the son of Poseidon and therefore has superpowers. (I bet my students wish they had superpowers, too.) I felt that the book started out well enough, but, for the critical adult reader that I am, didn't live up to its promise. First of all, the main characters just seemed kind of dim-witted. Despite the fact that they had stumbled into two consecutive situations where a trusted stranger turned out to be a mythical monster, they stumbled into at least two or three more by book's end. It seemed like the author's desire to write attention-getting action scenes killed any potential portrayal of somewhat intelligent characters. Second of all, this book was way too similar to Harry Potter to me. Sixth-grader who learns that he has magical powers and is a notorious figure in magical world? Check. Super-intelligent and clever female friend? Check. Loyal but not-as-talented male friend? Check. I'll probably read the second novel in the series--after all, HP #1 only set up the awesomeness that was to come. I hope it improves on this first book."
206,207,2,"Not my favorite. I'm sad I missed book club because sometimes I like a book better after going to the discussion. It's fantasy/young adult and in the same vein as Harry Potter except not as well written. There were also several knock-off concepts from Harry Potter that bothered me. Be original already! I didn't like the whole thing about not saying the names of the gods - too much like not saying Voldemort's name in HP. And the half-blood reference was very reminiscent of the mud-bloods in HP. Also, extremely predictable. I knew who the bad guy was the chapter after he was introduced. It was interesting to have a refresher on the Greek Gods...it's been years since sophomore year in High School World History when I had to memorize those!

Having said all the above, my 7-year-old really enjoyed it and it was nice to have something to discuss with him. I'm hoping to avoid all the questions surrounding the different mothers and fathers business with him for awhile with God's having children with mortals. That will be fun to explain. I won't recommend it to people my age."
207,208,2,"I m really in a bad mood.
I have expected a gud story and not gods ands heroes. Thats all bullshit.

And even if I dont believe in god that doesnt mean I would agree with this kind of insult to gods. Gods sleeping with human .....just doesnt seems right. One can give more respect than that.

And one thing is just stupid as it is. Gods fought in World War 2 and after that took oath to river stynx that they wont sire any child.

urghhhhh.....such a stupid thing. Medusa....has become aunty (grandmother) who now haunt this garden and captures children. And three children kills Medusa.
Ares, God of war !! and he's a bad bad biker and talks with contempt to children and asking for help from children. have really bad behavior and don't know how to talk to 12 yr old child.
How much more will this story degrade?!!

It seems author is not a great fan of Greek mythology. Seems like the author made fun of greek mythology.
I think this is for children. and I dnt know why the ratings are so high for this book.

Two star for being fantasy !!!"

Adventure
Percy is a twelve year old boy who has been in and out of boarding schools since before he could remember. He has horrible dyslexia, gets into trouble constantly and feels abandoned by both his mother and father. But all that changes when Percy learns hes not a normal boy but actually a child to the God Poseidon, God of the sea. When he is no longer safe in the real world he finds shelter at camp-half-blood. There he is given his first quest, to find Zeus's stolen thunder bolt. He takes along his best friend Grover and a girl Annabeth. The three face death and worse along the way but must make it to Hades, God of the underworld before time runs out.
I enjoyed the learning of the greek gods throughout this story, it gave a nice twist. But it was one book I was ready to put down half way through it. I'm not sure if it was the story line or the character development but I didnt become engulfed in the story as I usually am. But I'm sure some young people would find Percy relateable and his adventures to be exciting."
209,210,2,"Inutile dirlo: da questa saga mi aspettavo molto di più. Okay, questo è solo il primo libro e magari sono io troppo prevenuta, ma per ora PJ non ha avuto il potere di entrarmi dentro come ad esempio Shadowhunters. Ho trovato Il ladro di fulmini meraviglioso all'inizio, anche e soprattutto perché i temi trattati sono abbastanza originali e Percy è l'amore vero, ma penso che poi col proseguire dei capitoli si sia un po' perso. Di base ho continuato a leggerlo fino alla fine perché a) speravo sarebbe migliorato nuovamente; b) mi dà terribilmente fastidio lasciare i libri a metà e cerco sempre di evitare quando possibile. Nonostante tutto devo dire che non ho cambiato opinione su questo primo libro della saga, che sì è una lettura piacevole e tutto ma almeno per ora non è tra le mie preferite. Quando avrò un po' più di tempo libero comunque continuerò a leggerla, chissà che i libri seguenti riescano a prendermi di più!"
210,211,2,"Приятна книга, НО за деца. Не можах да я довърша, защото така и не предизвика интерес у мен и не бях нетърпелива да разбера какво ще се случи. Авторът си служи основно с диалози, които водят сюжета, а не с описания. Предполагам, че това е подходящо за деца, но на мен ми липсваше дълбочина.
Все пак, иска ми се да бях на 11, за да можех да ѝ се насладя истински и да стана част от света на Пърси. Засега явно ще разчитам на филмите."
211,212,2,"My Kindle has picked up on my childish streak, so it has taken to suggesting all kinds of juvenile fiction for me. This one was not my favorite. The characters were flat, the idea seemed overly contrived, and I wasn't as drawn into the world the way I was with the Septimus Heap or the Harry Potter books. As I was reading about the summer camp that the half-gods attend, all I could think of was a Berenstain Bears Go To Camp book that my son keeps making me read over and over. Sometimes young adult fiction isn't just repackaged adult books made more marketable, sometimes they truly are written for young adults. That being said, I may give the second book in the series a go if I can't think of anything else to read. I like the idea of the Olympians in the modern age, I just want them to be less... uh... cute."
212,213,2,"Clearly designed to help reluctant readers turn pages, this book is most definitely fast-paced. Unfortunately it is also extremely predictable: ""Percy meets creepy old lady. Percy feels creeped out, but proceeds forward anyway. Creepy old lady turns out to be: a fury/Medusa/etc., and tries to kill Percy. Percy either starts the fight well and ends up needing to be rescued by his friends, or begins the fight by getting beat up but is able to win and take his turn rescuing his friends.""

The fluffy nature of the series can be forgiven-- Percy's adventures are merely a bit of fun. However, there are some unhealthy implications to the story that make it perhaps unfit for its youngest readers. I appreciate the points made in this blog post:"
213,214,2,"Nah. I really tried getting into this, but 200 pages in I just don't want to force myself through the rest. I knew the movie beforehand and thought it was entertaining if a bit mindless. I expected something alike from the book and ... I mean. It is. Kind of. The story's a bit of a mess and the parallels to Harry Potter elements are pretty obvious. Still, it could have worked. It could have been that entertaining, mindless book that I expected. (Bonus points for the Greek mythology - it really is a nice idea to get kids nowadays interested in it. And some of the ideas ARE really interesting.) But I just can't get past the writing. It's so shallow and dull and the ""funny"" lines were just incredibly forced. Being a children's/YA book is no excuse for bad writing. So nah. I'll stick to the movies."
214,215,2,"I enjoyed greek mythology as a child and currently studying ancient greek. You'd imagine my excitement upon stumbling this book. Sadly, I had been disappointed. This book diluted the richness of Greek mythology to that of a vapid sink water. The first few chapters were somewhat tolerable, though I did not enjoy the fast paced development, if I could even call it that, of the starting point that would eventually lead percy's discovery of his true self.

I just did not enjoy this book. I felt inclined to like it at the very least considering its popularity and a very favored theme of mine but I ended up rolling my eyes a lot and deciding not to get on with the other books of the series.

The two stars are for percy's mother who had the character of a goddess herself, a self-sacrificing woman who loved her son more than herself."
215,216,2,"It was quite confusing for me. I didn't have too much knowledge about Gods. I also took time longer than I expected. Bored. At the same time, I was really busy at campus. But I continued read it day by day. Slowly I found how I enjoy this book. Funny enough.

I passed many paragraphs, actually :P

My favorite part is when they stay at Las Vegas. I can't imagine that games made people forget anything. I am not such a gamers or something, so I didn't know well.

The thing that I love from this book is the ending. It was really awesome to put a clue about the next story there. I was so excited! But I don't think to read the second book.

The review copied from my own blog"
216,217,2,"Because my kids wanted to watch the movies (and we have a rule in our house that the book must be read, first, if there is one), I was coerced into picking this up.

Badly written, the characters have NO redeeming qualities, and are either apathetic, belligerent, or sniveling. The plot is contrived, and I had the 'betrayer' pegged the minute the Oracle prophesied to that end. Makes for a crap read.

Half of the action is just ridiculous - a gift store still fully stocked in an abandoned amusement park? A hotel that has NOTHING to do with mythology that traps people there forever? To what end? And why would they give the kids free money like that? It made no SENSE. And I hated it.

One star for being able to spell. But wOw, did that disappoint."
217,218,2,"I think I’m one of the only people who didn’t really enjoy this book. It was so well written but I just could not get into it! I do not know why! I’ve read it twice and I still found it underwhelming. For a such hyped book, I wanted more depth to the characters because I just couldn’t connect to them enough to like them. Nothing against the author or people who like this book. Personally was not for me for no apparent reason. I don’t know what’s wrong with me because I just trudged through it. I wish I enjoyed it more because so many people say it’s a must read.

Update: after reading it for the 3rd time as a young adult, I still wasn’t the most interested but I definitely enjoyed it better than the last attempts."
218,219,2,"I realize I am not the target audience for this book series, this book is clearly written for elementary/middle school aged kids. So, if you are in this bracket you can disregard my review.

Outside of the writing style being very geared toward a younger crowd, the age of Percy doesn't match the actual character and made it conflict a bit for me. The mythology was a bit misleading for a couple of the characters but I realize that you can't tell everything to kids. All of this combined made for a difficult read for me. The only thing redeeming about this book was the ending which is why it got 2 stars."
219,220,2,"After hearing many good things about this series, I got the boxed set with all the books in it and was eager to read it. If I had read the first one before that, I probably wouldn't have bought the set - this book was not really for me.

I felt that Percy was a really unlikeable hero, and I didn't really care about his sidekicks either. He was able to overcome all his obstacles with way too much ease. I waited for the story to get to the point where I would be completely engrossed and couldn't wait to see what came next, but that just never happened. To me, this was a children's book that does not work for adults. Had I read it as a child, I would probably have liked it better."
220,221,2,"So stupid. ""Hey that Harry Potter book did well, let's do something like that! But instead of a school for wizards, we'll make a camp! For uh .... Demi gods! And we'll make it educational so we'll throw in some Greek mythology"" do not waste your time. Looking for the next Harry Potter or Phillip Pullman book I found a movie script about 8 year olds killing monsters. Yes it's peppered with mythology but it has the depth and complexity of a Ninja Turtle movie. Yes I realize it's for kids. But if you're older than 10 and don't spend your time thinking about how awesome it would be to chop off monsters heads, don't bother."
221,222,2,"Ok, so I decided to read this book all the way through since my daughter Aly is a big fan and I know she's going to drag me to the movie next week when it comes out. I thought it had potential and I'll probably read the next few in the series just because sometimes it takes a little bit for the author to really get into the story. It was a quick read which made it much less painful and I think with some good character development this could be a good series esp for the pre-teens to early teens. I'm all for any series that gets my kids reading!"
222,223,2,"Eh, I don't know. I wanted to like this more. I really like the idea, but something went wrong with the execution. Percy overcame the obstacles in his way too easily, too much seemed blatantly ripped off of Harry Potter and I want to beat people who say/write ""muzak"" instead of music with large sticks.

Some of it was cute, and it's probably a nice read for people in it's intended age group, but I'd rather reread HP again than continue this series.

Also, HITLER IS THE SON OF HADES, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Just... seriously?"
223,224,2,"While I thought the premise was good, Greek gods are sweet, and moving them into the modern era seems like an interesting idea. I was disappointed by the execution. The characters seemed flat, as well as remarkably dim witted. The plot was very linear and and predictable. The heavy use of foreshadowing meant that the reader knew of every major plot twist before it happened. Even though I realized going in that this book was written for tweens and lowered my expectations accordingly I was still underwhelmed, especially since I have heard some high praise for this series from various sources."
224,225,2,"Thought I'd give this a try after watching the movie release, which I enjoyed. As a big fan of the Greek/ Roman myths I really thought this would appeal. Sadly I was disappointed. The writing style is really, REALLY hard to read (it doesn't flow well at all), which was a shame as the themes and ideas were actually pretty interesting.

The characters were also well done and the setting was consistent, though it did have its flaws. I won't be continuing the series, though, because I just can't read the staccato style."
225,226,2,"Diciamo due stelline e mezza, dai. Lo schema narrativo del mezzo sangue �� sempre quello senza aggiungere nulla di nuovo sotto al sole. I personaggi sono senza infamia n�� gloria, troppo poco definiti sia per amarli che per odiarli. Sai dove va a parare la storia dal primo capitolo e quelli che dovrebbero essere colpi di scena non lo sono pi�� di tanto. Tutto sommato una lettura che pu�� essere pure piacevole per passare qualche ora con qualcosa di particolarmente leggero. D���altra parte non credo che legger�� il resto della saga."
226,227,2,"I'm not a fan of greek mythology, however, this book did have a very good plot. It's about a boy, who is the son of Posieden, and brother to Zues. After Zues' bolt is stolen Percy sets out with his friends to find it, and return it to Zues. I gave this book a 2 stars because I didn't like the way the narration was wrote. The narrator is Percy: who is supposed to be a sixth grade boy, but the language doesn't reflect that, it makes him seem way too sophisticated. Also, I found this book to be boring way too often and I often zoned out, which doesn't happen a lot when I read."
227,228,2,"Its very clear that this was written for middle grade boys, but was an entertaining enough action adventure/coming of age story. I haven't thought about Greek mythology in years, but apparently know enough to follow all of the characters the children meet on their adventure and in most cases figure out who they were before Percy did. I thought that the use of several locations was quite clever, and I liked the idea that Mount Olympus moves depending on where the power of Western Civilization is.

228,229,2,"Allgemeines:
Percy Jackson ist eine fünfbändige Fantasy-Buchreihe des US-amerikanischen Autors Rick Riordan, welche im Carlsen Verlag erschienen ist.

Band 1: Diebe im Olymp
Band 2: Im Bann des Zyklopen
Band 3: Der Fluch des Titanen
Band 4: Die Schlacht um das Labyrinth
Band 5: Die letzte Göttin


Irgendjemand hat etwas gegen ihn, da ist sich Percy sicher. Ständig fliegt er von der Schule, immer ist er an allem schuld und dann verwandelt sich sogar seine Mathelehrerin plötzlich in eine rachsüchtige Furie. Wenig später erfährt Percy das Unglaubliche: Er ist der Sohn des Meeresgottes Poseidon - und die fiesesten Gestalten der griechischen Mythologie haben ihn ins Visier genommen! Percys einzige Chance: Er muss sich mit den anderen Halbgöttern verbünden.


Der 12-jährige Percy ist eine Demigottheit (Halbgott) und der Sohn von Poseidon, weshalb er Wasser kontrollieren kann. Er wird beschuldigt, Zeus Herrscherblitz gestohlen zu haben. Um einen Krieg unter den Göttern zu verhindern, muss er den Herrscherblitz finden und, bis zur Sommersonnenwende, in den Olymp zurückbringen.

Annabeth ist ebenfalls eine Demigottheit und die Tochter von Athene. Sie und Percy haben sich anfangs nicht sonderlich gut verstanden, doch mit der Zeit werden sie zu guten Freunden. Annabeth ist außerordentlich klug und besitzt ein grosses Wissen über Kampfkünste und griechische Sagen, was ihnen im Verlauf der Reise von grossem Nutzen ist.

Grover ist ein Satyr und Percys bester Freund. Als Hüter ist es seine Aufgabe, die Halbgötter unversehrt ins Camp Half-Blood zu bringen. Leider kam einst ein Halbgott dabei ums Leben und Grover ist seither auf Bewährung. Indem er nun Percy und Annabeth auf ihrer Reise unterstützt und ihnen hilft, erhofft er sich eine Suchlizenz, die es ihm ermöglicht, nach dem verschwundenen Naturgott Pan zu suchen.


Bisher bin ich nie über den ersten Band hinausgekommen, obwohl ich schon seit Jahren den Schuber Zuhause stehen habe. Ich habe mich im Nachhinein oft gefragt, warum das so ist. Eigentlich liebe ich die griechische Mythologie und verschlinge gerne Bücher, die damit zusammenhängen. Also habe ich mir den ersten Band nochmal zur Brust genommen und versteh nun wieder, wo mein Problem mit dem Buch liegt.

Die Idee, die griechischen Mythologie in eine moderne ""neue"" Geschichte zu verweben, finde ich großartig. Im Großen und Ganzen wurde dies auch gut umgesetzt. Nur leider gibt es vieles, was mich gestört hat.

Alles in allem hatte ich beim Lesen durchgehend das unangenehme Gefühl, dass der Autor die Geschichte so schnell wie möglich auf den Markt werfen wollte. Etwas mehr Tiefgang hätte dem Buch bestimmt nicht geschadet, denn die Geschichte war meines Erachtens nicht wirklich ausgereift. Etwas mehr Eigenleistung und mehr eigene Fantasie des Autors hätten der Geschichte sicher gutgetan. Die Erklärungen zu den Gottheiten hätte ich zudem lieber detailreicher in der Geschichte aufgenommen, anstatt im Anhang des Buches als eine Art Glossar. Gleichzeitig fand ich es trotzdem gut, dass überhaupt ein Glossar vorhanden war. Nichtsdestotrotz sollte ein Glossar niemals die Erklärungen innerhalb einer Geschichte ersetzen.

Die Überschriften der Kapitel empfand ich als absolut schrecklich. Dann doch lieber keine Überschriften, sondern nur simple Zahlen, als so etwas. Zudem legt der Autor in diesem Buch einen ziemlich heftigen Patriotismus an den Tag. Er stellt Amerika über alle anderen Nationen, sodass sogar die Götter aus Athen fliehen. Naja… Patriotismus ist ja gut und auch recht, aber es war mir stellenweise dann doch etwas zu viel.

Positiv aufgefallen ist mir, dass Percy nicht den idealen Helden porträtiert und seine eigenen kleinen Macken und Schwierigkeiten hat. Die Charaktere an sich blieben jedoch sehr oberflächlich und hatten keinen Tiefgang. Ich habe kaum Bindung zu ihnen aufgebaut, wobei Grover hier noch der interessanteste Charakter von allen war. Interessante Dialoge waren ebenfalls sehr rar gesät und Percys 0815-Sprüche fand ich so semi-lustig. Auch Percys Verhalten, als seine Mutter ""verschwindet"", hat mich mit offenem Mund und ungläubig weiterlesen lassen. Die Trauer wurde vollkommen ausgelassen, stattdessen ging es so weiter, als wäre nichts passiert.

Des Weiteren ging alles viel zu schnell. Percy und seine Freunde rutschen von einem Abenteuer in das nächste, ohne dass dabei echte Spannung aufgebaut wurde. Die Kampfszenen im Buch werden recht übereilt und einfach dargestellt. Percy gewinnt jeden Kampf locker und ohne Probleme. Er ist zwar ein Halbgott, was natürlich übermenschliche Fähigkeiten mit sich bringt, aber er hat trotzdem kaum Kampferfahrung. Dennoch gelingt ihm alles viel zu schnell und viel zu einfach und er besiegt sogar Ares, den Gott des Krieges, problemlos. Das ist einfach nicht realistisch…

Unter anderem gab es auch Fehler im Lektorat – zum Beispiel hieß Annabeth plötzlich Annabell. Solche Fehler müssten eigentlich in einem Lektorat behoben werden.

Der Schreibstil an sich ist locker und leicht.


Die Reihe um Percy Jackson hat noch deutlich Luft nach oben und ich hoffe, dass der Autor das Potenzial noch ausschöpfen wird.

Für Kinder ist es bestimmt ein hervorragendes Buch, zumal sie hier auch in die griechische Mythologie eingeführt werden.

Obwohl mich das Buch etwas ernüchtert zurücklässt, werde ich dem zweiten Band diesmal bestimmt eine Chance geben.


2.5 von 5 Sterne"
229,230,2,"What I liked about this book is how it gave a positive spin to ADHD and dyslexia. All disorders are on a spectrum and offer coping benefits of one type or another, this book did a great job of giving a creative meaning to these challenges.

What I didn't like was that it was a total Harry Potter rip off. Even the boy/girl ratio, the different ""houses"", the age and on and on. These overlaps were distracting, if not irritating."
230,231,2,"Very lackluster plot that feels like a rip-off of Harry Potter and others of the fantasy genre. It is, however, an easy way to introduce Greek Mythology to children. I'm also tiring of the child who possesses magic and/or special gifts. What's wrong with having to work hard to hone your talent? That said, I'd recommend this for the reluctant reader or for the braniac who needs a bit of fluff. Michael gives it 5 stars."
231,232,2,
232,233,2,"I get aggravated by ‘retellings’ of Greek mythology. I’m going to sound like an old fart, but the original is always infinitely wiser, deeper and more interesting and more layered. Turning the tales that are the foundation of our civilization into meaningless, senseless action hero entertainment for teenagers sets my teeth on edge.

So you had ambrosia and you turned it to popcorn. I guess if it inspires ‘the kids’ to read, it’s a win. *Shrugs in grumpy"
233,234,2,"The Percy Jackson series were a huge love of mine the first time I read them and got me really interested in Greek mythology, so much so that I took classics A level!

Unfortunately, doing this has made me despise them, however much I wish I didn't, I just can't over look all of the faults!

I won't spoil it for you, but if you know anything about Greek literature, culture and mythology, you would never look at these books the same again :("
234,235,2,"The comparisons to Harry Potter are plentiful, and there were more than a few scenes where I wondered how this was not outright intellectual thievery from JK Rowling. Regardless, it was stupid, mindless fun. I don't think I can be bothered to read the others in the series, nor do I think it would be a worthwhile venture to do so. This insipid little piece of ridiculous will do just fine. 2.5 stars."
235,236,2,"This book is always a mixed bag for me. Truthfully, it was always just ""okay"". I have taught it multiple times and tried to change up the format in which it is read, but haven't really enjoyed the story. I do know my students love it! I prefer later novels in the Percy Jackson series over this one and I also really enjoy the movie adaptation but there is something about the way that this book is written that I just cannot put my finger on."
236,237,2,"Not horrible, but what a Harry Potter ripoff. It's all there...a bumbling boy sidekick, a brainy girl, a reluctant hero. House rivalries. Help from beyond the grave from a parent. Exchange magic for demi-god abilities. A dark lord returning to power. He even has to go live in the ""real world"" for part of the year. Sigh."
237,238,2,"I know this is just a fictional story and I shouldn't be so fussy, but here are my biggest issues:
1. Athena was a virgin goddess - there's no way she has little heroes running about Earth!
2. Hades wasn't any more villainous than the other gods. The Underworld/Hades is NOT hell (that's some place later religions came up with).
3. The plot makes very little sense."
238,239,2,"This is one of these cases where movie actually is better - more illustrating and fascinating than book. Book is not bad, but you just try to compare it with movie while reading and flick comes out winner most of the times. Also too much craving for coca-cola and junk food for my taste. Idea is good, but characters are too shallow."
239,240,2,"Me ha dejado mucho a desear, no es nada de lo que esperaba, no me dieron gracia ninguno de los personajes que son bastante cliché y no tienen nada de profundidad.

Estoy totalmente decepcionada porque esperaba bastante de Rick Riordan."
240,241,2,"While the Greek Mythology part was interesting and novel , some elements of the book were so reminiscent of the Harry Potter series , it kinda destroyed my enjoyment of it. But I will pick up the rest of the series as I do wanna know what happens to Grover and Knonos and of course Percy n Anna. 2.5 stars from an adult reader who adores Harry Potter n Narnia."
241,242,2,"This has been on my to-read-list forever, but man, what a disappointment. Very disjointed story of one event after another with no real risk because you know Percy isn't going to die. I get that it was supposed to mimic Greek myth quest stories, but they are all so rushed at silly that they don't work for me.
I'm taking the rest of the series off my list."
242,243,2,"2,5⭐️ li a muuuuito tempo e na época fez sentido por conta da minha idade e do personagem, entendo quem goste mesmo mais velho, porém, comigo não funcionou. gosto da ideia da mitologia e tudo mais só que além de não me conectar já vi o filme e esperava alguns acontecimentos que vieram. de qualquer jeito, reconheço que não é ruim e entendo quem gosta mas comigo não funcionou :("
243,244,2,I don't know how I felt after reading this book....it's just I chose this book for time-pass and it indeed was a great time-pass but I didn't like this book very much. I would have liked it few years back when I was like 10 or 9 maybe...but not this year. It was childish. For me I mean. I still ended up reading the full series...for time-pass.
244,245,2,"I've waffled back and forth between 2 and 3 stars, but decided on 3 because if my sons were reviewing it they'd give it 5 stars. They love these books and I can see why. Percy is an appealing character and Riordan writes with lots of energy.

The pink poodle was hard to take though."
245,246,2,"While it pleases me to no end to see the greek myths taking off and entering the young minds of its target demographic, the quality of writing brought this rating down for me. The modern day depictions of the gods are just accurate enough to hold my interest in this series."
246,247,2,"I tried to like it, but in the end it was too predictable since I'm familiar with the originals and abridged versions like Bullfinch. I can see why the series is popular; they are interesting stories retold in the vernacular."
247,248,2,"This book isn’t boring, but what was the point of making Percy go through all those obstacles? He overcomes them easily, doesn’t learn much from them and, in the end, the obstacles have very little relevance to the main plot."
248,249,2,"Dette var en spennende bok og bokem var skrevet godt - men jeg ikke likte tanken å bruke greske gudene i fantasien og filosofien om den ""vestern verden"" som er bedre enn alle andre, i hvert fall tolket jeg den slik."
249,250,2,"شاید اگه اینو تو ۱۰ سالگی می‌خوندم، خیلی باهاش حال می‌کردم ولی به درد الانم نمی‌خوره متأسفانه. اما از ایده‌ی اصلی کتاب خیلی خوشم اومد:
اینکه خواننده با ایزدان یونان باستان در قالب یه رمان تخیلی آشنایی پیدا می‌کنه و اصلاً دلیل اینکه سراغش رفتم هم همین بود. در کل همونطور که گفتم مناسب سنم نبود.
۲/۵⭐️"
250,251,2,Märks att jag har blivit äldre sedan jag sist läste boken första gången. Den är bra men inte en favorit. För lite kärlek för min smak men bra för att glömma verkligheten en stund. Kommer förmodligen läsa tvåan innan jag bestämmer mig för om jag ska fortsätta med serien.
251,252,2,"If only I had read this one as a teenager, I would probably have liked it. But at twenty one, I don't. A bunch of twelve year olds talking back to g o d s and saving the world i just... can't picture it. I can't. T w e l v e year olds!!!"
252,253,2,"Complete Harry Potter rip off, never enough explanation, moves way to fast and random plot points show up with now need or meaning. Like the casino? Totally just a desperate attempt to shorten the deadline. Lol not reading the rest"
253,254,2,"In this millenium, Mt Olympus is in the Empire State Building and Hades is in an LA recording studio."
254,255,2,"I read this book for school, and i didn't really like it. It's about a boy who fights monsters with weird creatures, and he goes to a special camp, and it's just really weird."
255,256,2,"I can totally see that kids would love this book... me... eh, it was ok. I struggled to get through it. I actually liked the movie better. Go figure."
256,257,2,"I liked this book better the first time, when it was called Harry Potter. Hey-oh!"
257,258,2,"Interesting ideas...but terribly written. It's worse than reading a comic book, or somebody's play-by-by of a movie they've seen."
258,259,2,"Hmmm... I didn't know ancient Greeks talked like that. :/ The story is ok, but the characters just ruined it for me."
259,260,2,"Update 18 Feb '15
In hindsight, it was just okay.

Just stopped short of four stars. I blame the movie."
260,261,2,Second time reading. I just...really don't like this book.
261,262,2,Review to come.
262,263,2,I think I'm too old for this series. I was just annoyed with all of them the whole time.
263,264,2,"4.5
I can't wait to get to the second book!"
264,265,2,"This book isn't that good because it was really unrealistic and boring. But there were some good parts in the book that made the book from zero stars, to two stars."
265,266,2,"Not my cup of tea, but totally get why it's so popular at school.
Also my rating is possibly a case of wrong book at the wrong time."
266,267,2,Just not for me. I found the characters annoying and the twists on the myths not enjoyable. I'll probably skip Rick Riordan from now on.
267,268,2,"Creative story, dull writing. Great for kids…not interesting enough for adults."
268,269,2,"just couldn't get into this for some reason, don't think I will continue the series"
269,270,2,Meeeeeeeh. It's just poorly written Harry Potter meets Greek mythology. A great idea but too boring to finish.
270,271,2,Beautiful illustrations!
271,272,2,"I know it is for kids, but it is pretty predictable."
272,273,2,"I was super exited to read this one, it's highly recommended but I relized that ı was too old to read it. EVerything sounded super childish, I couldn't get the willies more!"
273,274,2,k
274,275,2,This was okay. My 9 year old really enjoyed it and it was fun to have a modern story mixed with mythology but I didn't love it.
275,276,2,Meh.
276,277,2,I don’t even remember when I read this - certainly a few years ago. But I won’t ever reread it. Not recommended.
277,278,2,"My 9-year-old enjoyed it enough to jump into the second book right away. I didn't think it was anything special but I didn't mind reading it, either."
278,279,2,"Not....a big fan. It was my first time reading so maybe the lack of nostalgia glasses made me more critical, but I don't know if I will continue at all."
279,280,2,cute af
280,281,2,"brooo, this book is so overrated, it was fun? but even annabeth is dumb, soo..."
281,282,2,Voice is way too American
282,283,2,"English Review:
This book was my first audio book and on account of that it can also be possible that my opinion has shifted in some way about this book or was changed. At the beginning I thought that my‚ experiment – the first audio book‘, and that listening to someone who is reading the book, is exciting. Furthermore, it was particularly funny when the speaker tried to sound different in the dialogs with every new character which appeared.
Hence, as mentioned above I was enthusiastic at the beginning by this ‘new‘kind of going through a book. But soon this first curiosity faded and it started to annoy me for example that the speaker shifted his voice over and over again in such a childish way. Moreover, because of the listening to the book I felt much less involved in the story and in the plot, than it would have been if I had read it by myself. On top of that comes that I’ve listened to the audio book just seldom, because I am, nevertheless, rather a person who prefers listen to music while going to work or while jogging – and also while this exercises I had to concentrate too hard not to miss anything and get all that happens in the book. As a summary I can say that my first attempt with an audio book hasn’t really succeeded. I’ve expected more and would have hoped for more passion at my part, but unfortunately, this wasn’t the case and now I consider and ask myself whether I should leave audio books be or if I should try at a later time with another series once again. The time will show it, but at the moment I remain with reading the books by myself.

Now to the actual story of Percy Jackson, for which I’ve also had high expectations because of the great resonance around these books and also of the other members of the book forum, where I’m part of. Unfortunately, I was also disappointed concerning the contents of this book.
Though there were no serious mistakes which startled me or disturbed me intensely, but parts of the plot or of the characters haven’t worked right for me. From the beginning, I immediately felt that it’ about a children’s book, which would haven’t disturbed me further, because I’m also a big fan of Harry Potter and these were at the beginning of the series also children’s books. But here in Percy Jackson’s case, some things in the storyline and some thoughts of Percy weren’t coherent in my opinion.
Percy Jackson is a 12-year-old boy who experiences some unnatural things, until it’s revealed to him that he is a demigod and he’s also accused of being the thief of Zeus’s lightning bolt. The next things which are happening in the story or particularly how Percy reacts on them or also the other characters, are not quite realistic and are shown too heroically, as that it fits to a young lad, even if he’s full courage and pure heart. It was simply too exaggerated and unbelievable and which let me roll my eyes from time to time.

Also I didn’t found one character in the book which was really likeable or which let me worry for them much. For example Grover was for me not an amusing companion which should lighten the mood of the story, but he rather was a little bit annoying and too afraid and Annabeth was also not a very winning over character by her constant better knowledge and self-confidence. The plot, apart from the characters, was okay but hasn’t moved me in the way other books did or it wasn’t so exciting that I couldn’t put it away. Now it’s hard for me to say where the reason for that lies. Although I really try to stay objective, I think that it’s cased partially also because of using the audio book. Parts of the storyline were really interesting and I wanted to hear more, others were sucked from the fingers to pull the plot in the length.

Unhappily, the end was also not so good either and because of that I had to decrease my review points further down. Although I was surprised at the end when I got to know who really was the traitor in the whole story, there were still two or three things in it which I didn’t like very much. The most serious point was the letter to Percy from his mother, where she described how she has got rid of her boyfriend. I don’t know how someone can write such a thing in a children’s book? In a book where it is about heroism and morality, in the end it is virtually shown how the mother of the hero used the head of Medusa on her boyfriend and his buddies to transform them into stone. Not only that she has killed people with that, she has also shown an irreparable weakness. Which good characters would rather kill their enemies or somebody else to get away from, instead of pulling themselves together and show strength and face them, without murdering someone!? Moreover, especially unbelievable was the fact that there was also written that she has sold this‚ ‘stone sculptures’ for a lot of money. At first she murdered somebody and afterwards she also got a great benefit out of their death? Wow, I think it couldn’t be worse or more mean.
I am sorry, but I think that I need a longer break now before I’ll pick up the second book in this series and when it’s so far, then I’ll read it by myself and refuse to use an audio book.

Dieses Buch ist mein erstes Audio Buch gewesen und aufgrund dessen kann es auch sein, dass meine Meinung zu diesem Buch etwas verschoben oder verändert wurde.
Zu Beginn fand ich das ‚Experiment – erstes Audio Buch‘ und das Zuhören, wie ein anderer das Buch vorliest spannend. Außerdem empfand ich es besonders witzig, wie der Redner versucht hat bei jedem neuen Charakter seine Stimme anders klingen zu lassen.
Wie oben erwähnt war ich daher besonders am Anfang sehr angetan von dieser ‚neuen‘ Art ein Buch präsentiert zu bekommen. Aber schon bald verblich diese erste Begeisterung und es fing an mich zb. zu nerven, dass der Redner immer wieder so kindisch seine Stimme verstellte. Außerdem fühlte ich mich durch das Zuhören des Textes viel weniger in die Geschichte versetzt, als wenn ich es selbst gelesen hätte. Noch dazu kommt, dass ich selten das Buch gehört habe, da ich doch eher der Mensch bin, der Musik bevorzugt, wenn er zur Arbeit geht oder sich beim Laufen abrackert – bei diesen Dingen muss man sich ansonsten zu sehr auf den vorgelesenen Text konzentrieren um nicht abgelenkt zu werden und alles mitzubekommen. Als Resümee kann ich sagen, dass mein erster Versuch mit einem Audiobuch nicht wirklich geklappt hat. Ich hätte mir mehr erwartet und mir mehr Begeisterung meinerseits erhofft, aber das war leider überhaupt nicht der Fall und nun bin ich stark am überlegen, ob ich es mit den Audiobüchern ganz lassen soll oder zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt mit einer anderen Serie noch einmal probieren soll. Die Zeit wird es weisen, aber momentan bleibe ich wieder beim selber lesen.

Nun zur eigentlichen Geschichte von Percy Jackson, auf die ich ebenfalls hohe Stücke gesetzt habe, da die Begeisterung rund um diese Bücher von den anderen Mitgliedern des Bücherforums sehr groß war. Doch leider wurde ich auch inhaltlich von diesem Buch enttäuscht. Es gab zwar keine gravierenden Fehler, die mich aufschrecken ließen oder mich besonders intensiv gestört hätten, aber für mich haben Teile der Handlung bzw. die Charaktere nicht ganz funktioniert. Man spürt gleich von Beginn, dass es sich um ein Kinderbuch handelt, was mich nicht weiter gestört hätte, da ich ebenfalls ein großer Harry Potter Fan bin und diese zu Beginn auch Kinderbücher sind. Aber hier waren einige Handlungen und Gedanken für mich nicht stimmig.
Percy Jackson ist ein zwölfjähriger Junge, der einige unnatürliche Dinge erlebt, bis ihm offenbart wird, dass er ein Halbgott ist und beschuldigt wird den Herrscherblitz von Zeus gestohlen zu haben. Die darauffolgenden Dinge die in der Geschichte passieren und besonders wie Percy darauf reagiert oder auch die anderen Charaktere, sind für mich nicht ganz realistisch und zu heldenhaft dargestellt, als dass es zu einem jungen Knaben passt, auch wenn er voller Mut und reinem Herzens ist. Es war zu übertrieben und unglaublich und hat mich öfters mit den Augen rollen lassen.
Auch fand ich im Buch keinen Charakter der mir wirklich besonders sympathisch war oder der mich dazu gebracht hätte mit ihnen zu bangen. Grover war für mich leider kein lustiger Weggefährte, der die Stimmung aufhellen sollte, sondern eher etwas nervig und ängstlich und Annabeth war durch ihr Besserwissen und Selbstvertrauen auch nicht sehr einnehmend.
Die Handlung, abgesehen von den Charakteren, war okay, hat mich aber ebenfalls nicht sonderlich bewegt oder mitgerissen. Aber ich kann es nun schwer beurteilen, ob dies am Buch oder am Audiobuch liegt, obwohl ich wirklich versuche objektiv zu bleiben, und nicht die ganze Schuld dem Audiobuch zu geben.
Teile davon waren wirklich interessant und ich wollte mehr hören, andere dafür waren mir wiederrum ein wenig zu sehr aus den Fingern gesaugt um die Handlung in die Länge zu ziehen.

Das Ende setzte dann leider nochmal eines drauf, was die Bewertungspunkte leider sinken ließ. Obwohl ich überrascht war, als sich heraus stellte, wer nun wirklich der Verräter in der ganzen Geschichte ist, waren trotzdem zwei, drei Dinge mit denen ich mich nicht anfreunden konnte. Der gravierendste Punkt war für mich der Brief den Percy von seiner Mutter bekommen hat, in dem sie schildert wie sie ihren Freund los geworden ist. Ich weiß nicht wie man so etwas in ein Kinderbuch schreiben kann? In einem Buch indem es um Heldentum und Moral geht, wird zum Schluss quasi gezeigt, wie die eigene Mutter des Helden den Kopf der Medusa verwendet um ihren Freund und seine Kumpels, auch wenn er böse und gemein ist und sie geschlagen hat, in Stein zu verwandeln. Nicht nur, dass sie damit Menschen getötet hat und das willentlich, hat sie auch eine irreparable Schwäche gezeigt. Welcher gute Charakter tötet lieber seine Feinde oder sonst jemanden, um von jemand los zu kommen, anstatt sich selbst zusammen zu raffen und Stärke zu zeigen und denjenigen vor die Tür zu setzen, anstatt ihn zu ermorden! Besonders schlimm fand ich es außerdem, dass danach noch geschrieben wurde, dass sie diese ‚Steinskulpturen‘ verkauft und viel Geld dafür bekommen hat. Zuerst jemanden ermorden und dann noch Geld aus dessen Tod scheffeln? Wow, ich glaube ‚schlimmer geht’s nimmer‘.
Es tut mir leid, aber ich glaube ich brauche nun eine längere Pause bevor ich den zweiten Teil anfassen werde und wenn es soweit ist, werde ich ihn mit Sicherheit selber lesen und auf ein Audiobuch verzichten.

285,286,2,"Un ragazzino disagiato, maltrattato in casa, dotato di poteri speciali, capelli neri, occhi verdi, straordinaria somiglianza con il padre, in costante pericolo di vita, costretto a vivere per anni nel mondo 'normale' all'oscuro della sua vera natura così da essere meglio protetto...
I suoi due amici: un tipetto imbranatello e un po' fifone ma fedele e valoroso al momento opportuno; una saputella un po' arrogante ma dal gran cuore e dalla mente brillante...
Un luogo magico ed inaccessibile alla gente 'normale' in cui si istruiscono e addestrano ragazzini dai poteri speciali, popolato da curiosi personaggi e strane creature, organizzato in Case in competizione tra loro...
Un oscuro e potentissimo supercattivo, da tempo ritenuto sconfitto e scomparso di scena, tenta di risorgere e riconquistare il potere perduto...
Di cosa sto parlando? Ma di ovviamente! Chi di voi stava per dire !? Vergogna, cattivoni malfidenti... XD Solo perchè la descrizione del giovane Percy combacia con quella di Harry? Solo perchè Grover e Annabeth sono il riflesso di Ron e Hermione? Solo perchè Crono ha studiato sul manuale di Voldemort? Solo perchè il Campo Mezzosangue è la versione estiva di Hogwarts? Solo perchè Dioniso ha pagato una royalty a Snape per usare la sua battuta """"? Solo perchè l'Oracolo segue la moda lanciata dalla veggente Sybill Trelawney, ossia quella di abitare all'ultimo piano della scuola/campo, in una stanza accessibile solo attravero una botola? Solo perchè tra mortale e babbano, alla fine, c'è poca differenza? Solo perchè Percy e Harry hanno la stessa sfortuna di essere in collegamento onirico con la mente del supercattivo, e vedono in sogno eventi reali e funesti invece di essere liberi di sognare Belén Rodrìguez in santa pace? Solo perchè il berretto dell'invisibilità è la versione uso-singolo e moderna del mantello? Solo perchè Cerbero, come suo fratello Fluffy, si trova a guardia di un ingresso e può essere facilmente placato con un trucchetto da nulla? Solo perchè sia Percy che Harry hanno sulle loro spalle una profezia circa il loro destino e lo scontro finale con il supercattivo, e i rispettivi mentori Chirone e Dumbledore non intendono rivelargliela per tirmore di influenzarli negativamente? Ma andiamo, cosa andate a pensare...! XD
Fuor di battuta, diciamo che HP e PJ, caratterialmente non potrebbero essere in realtà più diversi: Harry è insicuro, confuso, quasi spaurito e magari un po' stupidotto, logicamente ignora molte cose del mondo magico in cui è stato improvvisamente catapultato, e si vede; Percy è dubbioso, sarcastico, ha l'aria da vissuto, cerca sempre di prendere in mano la situazione, dimostra una conoscenza mitologica insospettabile (riconosce a menadito creature e divinità con estrema facilità per essere un ragazzino americano del XXI Secolo), si muove con una disinvoltura sorprendente nel mondo olimpico pur essendovi giunto solo da pochi giorni, e non ha paura di confrontarsi con divinità dai poteri inimmaginabili.
Le situazioni ai limiti dell'assurdo si sprecano: dall'assai poco convincente spiegazione sul perchè l'Olimpo e le creature mitologiche classiche si trovino negli USA, alla lezioncina ambientalista di Grover, al griffatissimo Caronte, agli dei che si lamentano di continuo delle spese e dei costi (per non parlare di Ade che si lagna del traffico causato dalla pletora di morti che affolla il suo regno e della quantità di personale necessaria per gestirli), alle rocambolesche vittorie di Percy su mostri e dei, ecc. Decisioni fondamentali vengono prese con una leggerezza esasperante, tutto succede perchè deve succedere, in perfetto stile .
La trama, pur essendo molto superficiale, è eccessivamente fitta di eventi, e la folla di mostri e nemici che Percy&Co. si trovano di volta in volta ad affrontare nel giro di poche pagine è decisamente esagerata per un solo libro, neanche si trattasse dei livelli di un videogioco.
La narrazione in prima persona, ricca di anticipazioni e considerazioni a posteriori, priva la storia di pathos e, alla lunga, risulta anche irritante.
Due stellette e mezza, date più sulla fiducia in un possibile miglioramento (e in un auspicabile distacco da HP) nei successivi capitoli della serie, che per meriti effettivi. Decisamente non mi ha coinvolto.

PICCOLA OSSERVAZIONE STUPIDA: Avete notato? Il figlio di Hermes si chiama Luke, e ha delle scarpe alate che gli permettono di volare, quindi di 'camminare nel cielo', per così dire. Ora, sky in inglese significa cielo, e walk significa camminare; quindi Luke 'che cammina nel cielo' è...!! XD ..."
286,287,2,"As I was growing up, Percy Jackson was a popular series among my friends and the hype escalated with the movies. I only heard good things about the books everywhere I went and even watched the second movie, on the premiere, with my best friends - not knowing a single thing about anything! I don't usually follow literary trends so I'm always late for the party (e. g. I only read HP in my senior year at high school) that's why it took me a decade to finally put my hands in this book, and solely because a friend insisted and borrowed me the entire series. Needless to say, I expected great things from this book but, dear Lord... I left so, disappointed. I can't believe it has such a high average rating on this website...

To be fair, before I begin, I want to say this: the story itself is good. Greek mythology meets the modern world. Teenagers with superpowers, children from Gods and Goddess, who live in a Training Camp and go on the wildest adventures. Also, all the mythology references are very entertaining! I'm not familiar with Greek mythology to catch them all, but the ones I did, I enjoyed. The world-building is cool. It's very interesting.

My problem lays with his writing: shallow characters, bad dialogue, vague descriptions, awful suspense and cliffhangers, extremely predictable plot full of clichés, unfunny jokes, weak display of emotions, and honestly Percy is so dull! I think he's the worse written character I remember ever reading in a book. He tried to make him sound witty and ""different"" from the others, like wow, look at our protagonist, how relatable he is. That's why he's the ""chosen one"". It felt SO forced.

So many things didn't make sense and annoyed me in his character. He finds out his father is literally a GOD, he has powers, there's a magic world in parallel with ours with mythical beings and monsters, his best friend is a Satyr, his teacher is a Centaur, and best of all, he is not like people liked to point out... and every opportunity he has, he acts condescendingly and skeptical, even though miracles appear in front of his eyes literally every second. That's the coolest thing to ever happen to someone ever and he takes them for granted. If I were him, I'd want to learn everything I could and explore my powers at max. It's like finding Willy Wonka's golden ticket and putting it in the back pocket of your jeans, crumpling it up.

Also, he survives a car crash and expresses nothing more than ""Ouch"". Or a minotaur supposedly killing his mother in front of him and him having fun the next day getting to know the camp. Almost no depth at how his physical and mental pain is eating him alive (as it should). I mean, he's a 12-year-old for god sake! A child!! He should be shitting his pants and crying himself to sleep!! But he shrugs it like bad luck and moves on like nothing happened.

The time skips were so difficult to handle, too. On the left page they were in an intense fight with a monster, in the right page they were already on a bus going somewhere and chatting normally.

And he always pauses the narrative. No depth in his descriptions, or emotions in a scene. Just plain phrases with action, like this: Percy went ahead and told Annabeth this. Annabeth was angry. Said this. Then Percy talked to Grover. Grover was upset. *Insert shallow dialogue*. Percy thought Grover was right. Percy thinks a clever but unfunny joke, trying to be witty. End of chapter.

Honestly, to me, it felt like it was his first time writing a book. It felt inexperient, to say the least. I read lots of fanfiction online and his writing reminded me a lot of them... It's aimed at children of course, but I'd dare say for children that are starting to develop a taste for books with not much experience in reading. I don't know how one can go from reading something like Harry Potter (that people love to compare with PJ, and even though they have similar tropes, one has nothing to do with the other) and then read Percy Jackson and *really* enjoy the ride. If you did it as a child/teenager, it's comprehensible though, but as an adult with experience in reading, I can't even imagine...

Yet, for as ironic and hypocritical as it may sound, I'm still willing to give the series a second try. I decided to read the second book, Sea of Monsters, because, putting aside the writing, as I said, I enjoyed the plot. I think it has potential, and I want to believe that Riordan's storytelling may eventually improve. I hope so. Otherwise, I'll have to wait for the tv series's release.

That's it - End of review."
287,288,2,"I don't want my 2 star rating to be seen as terrible.... it was ok. Just ok. Ordinarily I would probably give it closer to a 3 star but I gave the first two Harry Potters a 2 star rating and they were better than this book and I cannot be bothered to go back and revise everything.

I am obviously not the target audience for this book and I am sure it would have been more enjoyable if I was younger.

First, this book borrows a lot from Harry Potter in my opinion -

That said, it is not a bad formula and it is somewhat interesting anyway. I may even listen to the next ones when I find myself bored in the car.

I did find myself getting very annoyed with the characters at times, I found some of their interactions and behaviors unrealistic for kids. I also found the gods to be unrealistically childish in some ways, though I will admit that at least this has some basis in the Greek myths.

I think the ""names have power"" thing doesn't really work well for this book. It works ok for Voldemort to be ""he who must not be named"", but when you are trying not to say the names of several gods, it starts to become difficult to follow a conversation. Consequently, the author had to have the characters use the gods' names several times and it was very inconsistent as to whether or not it was dangerous or a bad idea to do so. Apparently when you mention a name, the god would have a better chance of cuing into you and what you are saying and doing.








Honestly, some of my issues are just nit-picky. It seems like a decent choice for younger kids and early teens who are interested in fantasy series."

Ce lo avete chiesto in tanti! In particolare l’utente @cabin_13 su Wattpad, che vogliamo citare fra tutti perché… così, a caso. Giusto per dire il nome di uno di voi, amatissimi lettori!
Stiamo parlando di un libro che, teoricamente, è iconico… una specie di Hunger Games, di Harry Potter e la Pietra Filosofale, di Nihal della Terra del Vento (anche se quest’ultimo stona tantissimo citato nel novero, oh déi se stona! Come vedere un airone che passeggia fra le papere), insomma l’inizio di una serie mainstream per ragazzi. Una roba ossessionante, giusto? Giusto. Di quelle che quando le inizi da bambino ti risucchiano in una spirale in cui il tuo pensiero fisso è “voglio saperne di più”.
Solo che questa volta, il libro non l’abbiamo letto da ragazzi (o addirittura da bambini) e non siamo stati investiti dalla sua ondata di popolarità, quindi siamo quasi completamente esterni al suo fenomeno, e diciamo “quasi” solo perché l’abbiamo sentito citare in tv. Non è il nostro target, visto che siamo grandi. Non abbiamo neanche mai visto i film, quindi entriamo con cautela, guardandoci attorno e cercando di capire con cosa abbiamo a che fare.
La recensione di oggi sarà dedicata a Percy Jackson e il Ladro di Fulmini, il primo della serie di cinque libri dedicati tutti al nostro piccolo Percy (e agli dei dell’Olimpo), scritti dall’autore americano Rick Riordan.
Ora, germoglietti tenerini, lo sappiamo che per molti di voi questo è un libro caro al cuore e sappiate che le nostre parole non devono categoricamente farvi cambiare quello che sentite per esso, perciò vogliamo ricordarvi che la nostra recensione è estremamente personale. Sì, di solito non diciamo mai queste cose a inizio recensione, anche se sono ovvie. No, non le stiamo dicendo perché ci accingiamo a demolire il libro a colpi di palla demolitrice… ma stiamo per parlare di un libro che, da quanto ne sappiamo, ha aiutato molti bambini, ragazze e ragazzi più o meno grandi, ad accettare di più sé stessi. Stiamo parlando del primo libro di una saga che ha in sé variegata rappresentazione e che per forza di cose può dare a molti una sensazione di appartenenza, perciò parliamo di qualcosa di delicato e non possiamo direttamente buttarci, con la ruvidezza che ci contraddistingue.
Noi analizziamo tutto in base ai nostri, e solo ai nostri, gusti personali.
Quindi, sia che amiate Percy Jackson e il Ladro di Fulmini, sia che lo troviate un libro superficiale e infantile, buttatevi insieme a noi e fatevi quattro risate con la nostra ironica recensione spinosa ;)


1. La trama
Il nostro protagonista è Percy Jackson, un ragazzino di dodici anni che vive a New York con la madre Sally. Suo papà non si sa chi cavolo possa essere, perché come nella più cliché delle storie sugli orfani, la mamma non fa altro che dirgli cose tipo “Ah, era bello” “Ah, era bravo” “Ah, somigliava a te” oppure “Ah, è sparito per sempre, disperso in mare”. Normale no? A giudicare dalle ventordicimila opere incentrate su ragazzi che hanno padri importanti e misteriosi, sì.
Quindi, cosa rende il nostro piccolo Percy, ragazzino bianco con capelli scuri, unico? Cosa lo distingue da tutti gli altri undicenni/dodicenni prescelti e fra loro completamente identici?

289,290,2,"Maybe a 2.5 star effort for being a quick read and ending well. But I mean...REALLY?! I obviously didn't come to this book at the right age. Maybe had it existed and I had read it as a 10 or 12-year-old kid I might have liked it, but now at 32 it just isn't that great. Don't get me wrong, I like YA fiction/fantasy and I can be forgiving on some weak plot points, forced romance and cheesy dialog, but this pushed too many buttons. For instance, if you're going to have rules that your world abides by, make sure the world abides by them. Why does Chiron and Grover and Annabeth and everybody tell Percy that humans won't see the monsters because of some kind of fog and then in the St. Louis arch everyone can see the giant Chihuahua? Or Percy's sword? And then why are the swords during the fight with Ares seen as guns? Why does Grover tell Percy he literally can't lose his sword, but then he does when it falls into the river - why have that be a thing at all if it is never used? Checkov's rule about a gun in the first act going off in the third applies here. Also, why does everyone who knows stuff about Percy's destiny not tell him anything?! It's so stupid to have a prophecy that is purposefully vague and Percy ask people direct questions about them and they just simply don't answer, it's a gimmick and I hate it. The twists and betrayals are broadcast loudly and clearly and there were very few surprises.

But of all my gripes my biggest are plotting and story, the basic tenants of writing no matter what the genre or intended age group. Nothing, NOTHING, happens in this book based on Percy's choices. Everything happens TO him, he makes NO decisions. He gets a quest and gets on a bus - there's some Fates to fight. They get off the bus and happen to be right at Medusa's lair, they fight her. They go to the St. Louis arch (not because of a choice having to do with their quest, mind you, but because Annabeth likes architecture - or something?) and some giant dog attacks them. They get dropped off in Las Vegas and happen to end up right in front of the Lotus Hotel. And on, and on, and on. I hate to make comparisons to other works, but...Harry Potter (far from perfect, but EONS ahead of this) at least makes choices. He investigates, figures out, make mistakes and then sneaks of his dormitory and DOES STUFF! Make a choice, Percy!

Anyway, I MIGHT read the next one only because it ends with a cliff hanger and I'm a glutton for punishment and these books are quick reads and maybe things get better. I didn't even cover most of my grievances (NO chemistry amongst Ron, Harry and Herm... I mean Percy, Grover, and Annabeth; overly used trope of normal - to the point of obscure - child who is actually...Super powerful and all knowing [turns out your ADHD and dyslexia just means you're a super awesome warrior and can read Greek]; openly aping HP - ""Our new celebrity"", can speak to animals, etc.; inconsistent powers - water heals you, except when it can't, hey you can speak to horses; and on, and on, and on) so who knows if I will actually get around to the others."
290,291,2,"Let’s just establish this first. The book was way better than the movie. Yes, many rather cliché elements which I often see when jumping on the whole adventure-fantasy-one-hero bandwagon surfaced again. But, no one prepared me for the level of sassiness I would witness. When I meant humour me, Percy and Annabeth really lived up in those aspects, the magic of which was really lost on me in the movie.

Just for the sake of reminiscing, here’s the compiled list of some of the witty comebacks and moments where they’re just full on roasting each other:






Or my favourite one really:



However, I do feel like all good things always come to an end. Jokes aside (pun not intended), there was very little substance to the plot. The infusing of Greek mythology has traditionally always been cool, but the whole embarking-on-an-across-the-country-trip lacked the action I was really there for. It does get too predictable as well when Percy faces insurmountable obstacles and just miraculously subdues and defeats everything that comes his way.

The chemistry?? Super ehhh. It’s like some replicate of a high-school trio where Percy is the hotshot superstar who’s always thrusted into the limelight, Annabeth is some nerdy-badass stereotype and Grover is the third-wheeling friend who is occasionally forgotten—at least I know that I do (definitely reminds me of certain somebodies from a certain wizarding world).

And Percy? Our everyday hero parading around with his intimidating ballpoint pen is like one of the numbest (or simply emotionless) characters I’ve ever seen. He mutilates his own teacher and brushes it off as hallucinations; sees his mother vapourise into nonexistence like it happens everyday; eagerly accepts a quests of which he has prepared for for mere days and faces death like it’s nobody’s business. I think we need to give the boy an award because the countless times he’s gone into battle, come out unscathed and anticipates the next time he can have yet another near-death experience is unbeatable.

One last point (I promise I’ll stop after this) was the sad lack of death in this book (that’s right, your favourite sadist is back and she’s thirsting for more). I won’t spoil too much but the gore and suffering and bloodthirst was pathetic. It’s almost like all the demigods are immortal and Percy is some irritating bug that won’t die no matter how many times I squash it.

I was expecting a lot more from how much hype this series was getting but judging from the content of the movie, my expectations had literally hit rock bottom. Sad to say I did not like it as much as I thought I would."
291,292,2,"I’ve always been a big advocate of differentiating a story “made for kids” from a story “appropriate for kids”. Younger characters, accessible themes and tone doesn’t necessarily make the literature childish. Well, this book is made for kids.

I’ll start with the main and unfortunately only good aspect of this for me. The premise and worldbuilding is indeed entertaining. Not solid, not clever, but interesting. I’d love to read the version of this book with more depth put into it because there is so much fun to be had in this world.

The modern characterization of Greek legends is insanely fun. If you were to write Dionysius in present day US, a grumpy alcohol deprived old man wearing Hawaiian shirt is absolutely the way to do it. Camp Half Blood seems like a place taken out directly from my middle grade dreams. I love camping vibes and matching that to a fantasy setting is a delight to read. Unfortunately, we barely got to spend 90 pages hanging in the camp before leaving and the book only went downhill from there on.

The plot is absurdly silly. Percy encounters and defeats all the most powerful monsters in history in the most convenient and dumb ways possible. He defeats his old math teacher fury twice, the exact same way. At one point they passed through Cerberus literally throwing a rubber ball at him. That’s Dora the Explorer level of adventure. Also, ADHD and Dyslexia are symptoms of demigod powers? Really?

At some point I stopped trying to keep track of the whole lore and motivations since everything in this world is explained by “A god did it”. Which I guess is appropriate to the level of logic and complexity of the original Greek mythos, but it's still not great storytelling.

By far my biggest issue with this book is the characters. They all sound like they were written by Dan Schneider for a Nickelodeon sitcom. Literally in every dialogue Percy drops some edgy ironical comment that’s painfully unfunny. They are so unserious all the time. I could almost hear the laugh tracks every time Groover had a completely out of tone dumb line in the middle of a scene. Speaking of which, Groover and Annabeth have the personality of a paperclip. Why are they even here? Heroes’ parties are made of trios and satyrs must protect their heroes despite being way weaker than a demigod because… a god said it, I guess. I’m sure this choice of characters has nothing to do with a certain wizard novel.

I’ll be picking up the second book eventually out of pure curiosity. In the first book already, Percy has done more than any other Greek hero, defeating almost all the famous monsters, escaping the underworld and evenly matching the god of war in a duel. And we still have five more books in this saga alone? Is there even that many Greek legends? I just hope the writing matures a little along the way otherwise I’m not sure I’ll be finishing the series."
292,293,2,"« Un destin de héros n’est jamais heureux. Il n’est rien d’autre que tragique »

Hello hello ! Alors mon avis sur Percy Jackson (Time 1) sachant que j’ai acheté les 20, malgré cet échec, je continuerai car j’ai espoir en cette saga. Mais ce premier tome ne m’a pas du tout convaincu. Je sais que de base c’est adressé à un publique jeune. Mais vu le nombre de gens idolâtrant cette saga, je pensais que même étant « presque » adulte, on pouvait y prendre du plaisir.

Je vais parler déjà des problèmes que j’ai eu avec ce tome.

1) Les facilités dans l’intrigue.

Déjà tout était beaucoup trop prévisible, surtout par rapport aux antagonistes et aux combats. Je n’ai pas eu une once d’étonnement devant ce livre. De plus le peu de fois où la situation semblait compliquée, on nous résolvait ça hyper facilement. Ça m’a frustré.

2)Les personnages.

Alors je sais, les personnages sont jeunes. Donc c’est normal si leur perception du danger ou encore leurs décisions peuvent être bancales. Mais là, la fameuse Annabeth, l’intelligente du groupe, malgré que je donne un point pour le fait qu’elle les aient parfois sorti de situations périlleuses. Elle reste vachement naïve.

3) La plume

Encore une fois, je donne une excuse à l’auteur. Je me dis vu que Percy est un pré-ado et qu’on est dans sa tête. Le style d’écriture correspond à lui. Mais ça m’a quand même pas mal dérangé. Ça restait fluide et tout je ne dis pas. Mais je trouvais l’écriture enfantine.

4) Sujets trop peu approfondis

Je radote, mais là j’ai tout de même trouvé une excuse, vu que c’est étendu sur plusieurs tomes. Les sujets peuvent être améliorés. Mais certains dont un particulièrement sur à la fin [SPOILERS] on apprend que Gaby a déjà frappé la mère De Percy. Et ce qui aurait pu laisser un sentiment de culpabilité à Percy, ou des séquelles sur sa mère. (D’ailleurs J’ai beaucoup aimé qu’à la fin il se fasse transformer en statue) bien mérité pour lui.

Bref le problème que j’ai eu avec ce livre, c’est qu’en tant que jeune fille de 17 ans qui consomme beaucoup de young-adult + fantasy. J’avais vraiment l’impression que c’était fait uniquement pour les plus jeunes.
Mais cette saga a beaucoup de potentiel. Et je vais lire le deuxième tome. Donc voilà

No esperaba una trama tan juvenil. Ha sido una historia muy aventurera que aprofundiza poco en los personajes y se focaliza más en la acción.

Lo que me ha gustado han sido las primeras muestras de cariño de Annabeth hacía Percy <3



También que la mitología se presenta poco a poco. Aunque luego aparecen demasiados personajes mitológicos y ya no sabes quién es quién.

Bueno, ahora lo que no me ha gustado lol.

El libro es juvenil:
- Esto hace que no conecte mucho ni con la historia ni con los personajes. Annabeth me ha parecido más interesante que los demás, pero Percy no me ha caído bien.
- Hay mucha acción, lo que personalmente me aburre (el último libro que leí Age of Assassins sí tenía buena acción jeje).
- El ritmo al que transcurre la trama es demasiado elevado para llegar a sentirte implicado/una conexión (pero entiendo que es para un público más joven).

Usa clichés que no me gustan especialmente... 1) los sueños y 2) el elegido. Nunca en su vida ha tocado una espada y la primera vez ya se le da bien (que sea el elegido aún, pero que al menos practique un día sabes…)
Algo que me ha incomodado es que se da por hecho que los dioses no tienen autocontrol sexual.

Luego hay detalles que le hacen perder aún más puntos:
- No me gusta cómo empieza, siendo todo tan ‘secreto’. Le esconden todo a Percy y cuando empieza a conocer todo el nuevo mundo siguen ocultándole cosas… como lector no me gusta que te dejen sin explicación todo el rato.
- En un momento que están Percy, Annabeth y Grover en una misión, suben al ascensor y se separan ??? cuando tienen que proteger a Percy. La razón: ya habían entrado los dos en el ascensor, y salir para que entren otros ‘molestaría a los demás’ wtf.
- Hay escenas q no pintan nada como la del casino ??
- Incongruencias, como por ejemplo que le dicen a Percy que no diga los nombres de los dioses, y luego ellos los dicen.

Porque es Percy Jackson, si no habría abandonado la saga. La seguiré ahora y a ver qué tal."
294,295,2,"It was ok. I do not understand the hype at all. This was a very entertaining middle grade novel and I am definitely going to look for the other parts. However, I found it extremely hard not to get impatient with the obviousness of plot points and the time it took the main characters to become aware of what readers realise so incredibly early on, but I am sure that I am not the target audience. Still - the main character learned about Latin and Greek myths at school and still can't place any of the mythical creatures he encounters? Really? How little attention was he paying in his favourite class?
Also, the gods. Rudolf Otto, theologist, writes that holy things are regarded by humans with fascination and fear. Here, there is neither and I do not think that this helps the book. I am also not happy with the cute, pat disneyfied versions of the gods, but I don't think that most modern minds can really wrap their head around polytheism any more and thus all gods become caricatures of themselves, downplaying not only their power if they existed, but also their multifacetedness and leaving them with one aspect. Thus, Dionysus becomes the party god, Poseidon a surfer dude.
I don't like this and don't think this is necessary. If readers are to take multiple deities seriously in a book serious, they must needs be written as what they represent - eternal forces greater than mere human mortals. If Poseidon shows up in a book, he needs to be more than a surfer dude water mage. I want him to be shown as the force that inspired him in the first place - the untamable power of the ocean, pitched against which all human ingenuity and strength still strive in vain. And Dionysus cannot be the comic relief god of wine - this is only one aspect of this god of ecstasy and madness, a reminder of the frailty of human reason. I don't really see what is gained by NOT having that in this middle grade book, as writing them as what they represent surely would raise the stakes of the quest our hero undertakes."
295,296,2,"I'm not a child, and I didn't read this as a child, so I found this book less than exciting.

Percy is the typical ""I'm weird and bullied, but I am so AWESOME and get the coolest girl around"" young male protagonist that I find in books written by, well, males. The ""coolest girl"" is the one who can beat everyone in training/board school in 2 seconds flat but in real situations is always saved by the protagonist (damsel in distress has to play hard to get, right?). The protagonist is always clueless and isolated during training/boarding school but suddenly does something or has something happen that makes him suddenly subject to idol worship (ooooo, you're kid).

The lead-in (and the whole book for that matter) is the timeless child v. adult, where the adults get shifty and say they have to tell the kid something ""but it can wait,"" which means it's already too late and . This happens over. and over. and over. and over. and over. again in this book. I'm really sick of if.

Medusa, Echidna, Procrustes, the Lotus Hotel are haphazardly thrown in, and none of them make any sense in relation to the larger plot. I can't figure out if they're working for one of the powers-that-be, or if they're just drawn to power and want to control/destroy those who have power. All of the monster run-ins are ""whoo, rest-stop!"" moments where it screams ""OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A TRAP"" like a cheap, straight-to-VHS horror movie. The names and the settings of each monster's location seem like Riordan was channeling Stephen King a la The Dark Tower series.

But for all that the writing and plot were kinda...whatevs, Riordan does a masterful job of bringing the Greek gods into the present (both in their descriptions and in the larger scheme of a book) and I can see how he can make a new generation of children fall in love with Greek mythology. Well done, Riordan. I say that as someone who never cared much for it beyond Disney's Hercules and left the book wanting to learn some real Greek history."
296,297,2,"I really don't know how I feel about this book. I was debating between 2 and 3 stars, but then I remembered
Percy encouraged her mom to kill Gabe (which she later did) rather than just leave the man now that he's no longer needed for his scent which made me feel I needed to rate it lower.

Overall it was a fun read. I wasn't overly fond of the writing style, but I understand the target market so I'm okay with the direction of first person narration as it's easier to follow for younger readers.

I enjoyed the worldbuilding. It wasn't ever too exposition heavy. And, of course, I liked the greek theme. The characters were interesting enough, but everyone outside of Percy felt pretty useless during the quest. This was more the Percy Jackson show, and although fun, I hope the other characters get to shine in the future.

Below are general thoughts:"
297,298,2,"Audiobook.

I’ve heard a lot about this book and series, and I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about. I enjoy #YA though I don’t often partake. Harry Potter? Yup. Loved it. Hunger Games trilogy? Yup. Super loved it. Divergent? Yup. Not a fan. Percy Jackson...let’s see how I felt.

The writing in this first book is no nonsense. It gets you right into the action and moves quickly. There’s not a lot of subtly; everything Riordan wants you to know is right on the surface. The characters are distinct, but their personalities are thin. Each fits an archetype—funny sidekick, sassy girl frenemy, and the plucky protagonist who stumbles into awesome power—and never wavers. That’s good for telling a simple story—which The Lightning Thief is—but that’s bad for character growth. These characters really don’t change throughout the novel—like, say, Ron, Harry, or Hermione did; they are who they are through and through. Some YA does more in this area; this book didn’t.

The pacing of the novel is swift. X happens and then Y and then Z. In some places, the pacing is nice because we don’t linger too long before the next big story beat. In other places, the pacing just blows past events that needed explanation seemingly for the sake of expediency. Unfortunately, that makes parts of the novel speed along much too fast, eschewing character development for plotting.

The plot itself felt very paint by numbers to me. I read a lot of fantasy, so that could explain my uncanny ability to presage every turn of the plot. It doesn’t deviate much from the format you might expect except in one instance—who the big baddie is. That was a nice twist at the end that stood out against the trite story beats in the rest of the novel.

I feel like I might give book two a go simply because this might be a warm up and the later novels might get significantly better. The writing was not bad. Just plain. Everything was just too predictable."
298,299,2,"2.75 rounded down

I wasn't really planning on trying to remedy my missing the Percy Jackson train, but some folks I know were doing a buddy read so I gave it a go. I get why it's a beloved series, and I definitely don't want to yuck any one's yum, but this book fell way short for me in the end.

Cons:
-Fatphobia abounding. All characters that are depicted as fat are evil. Step father, bully at the camp, camp director, and a monster that attack later in the book are all heavily described via their fatness and it is entirely a negative thing. There are no positive depictions of fatness. (There are two non-speaking minor characters that are depicted as ""plump"" - due to their lack of a speaking role & proximity to a not good character I don't think they're offsetting anything.)
-Just about every single plot point has lying, deception, or withholding somewhere in its origin. Between not explaining things or actively deceiving each other it's a little miraculous anything actually gets accomplished in this novel.
-Subpoint to the above: adults are to be trusted without question, but it is also adults that create the problems these *children* are now responsible for fixing. I am not a big fan of kids carrying the weight adults should be handling.

These two.5 issues are pretty weighty for me, particularly because this is a series of books directed at children. I don't have kids, but I wouldn't want them reading a series that codes fat as bad & solidly encourages deception & doesn't invite pushing back when an adult isn't making sense but is asking a lot of you.

-Percy Jackson *is*12*years*old*. That's too young for the things he does & for the writing to be convincing.

Pros:
-Grover. All of him.
-There is some clever use of Greek lore, and a few magical items that are dope.

All in all, the biggest redeeming quality of this book is how quick it was to read. I don't think I'll read anything from the series."
299,300,2,"It was alright. A good adventure story, but way too long. The thing I just don't get about a lot of these stories written for younger audiences is why they drag out - and not with any substance (like Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit) but with fluff. If this had been condensed, it would have been so so much better. I was asked to read it by my 11 year old. She started it and after a few pages she handed it to me and asked if it would get any better.
I had a bit of a hard time getting though as well. Things that the author made very clear early on were dragged out. Who is Percy's Father?! We just don't know, we cant figure it out... even though he gets near water and weird things happen. (Not to mention it's clear from the cover art.) This was the whole book. It makes the characters seem slow and dull when they can't guess what has been made abundantly clear. It was a bit like the Superman thing. Seriously. He's the same exact guy except with glasses and without glasses. How can these people not tell? You read something and think, I bet this is the problem, and then your guess is confirmed, and then you still have to wait... pages and pages for the characters to catch up. After a whole book of that, it just got to be annoying by the end.
Yea, thats the friend thats going to betray you Percy. It's so ridiculously obvious, but sure, go off with him by yourself. Seems like a good idea. SMH.
I really don't think the idea of this book was bad, it had some fun stuff for sure, but it could learn a thing or two from books like the Spiderwick chronicles. My kids plowed through all of those, and all of them said at the end, ""I wish they were longer! Or that there were more!"" Even longer books like Secret Garden, the City Of Ember, and The Chronicles of Narnia. If they're long, they should be full."
300,301,2,"I remembered this book as being pretty bland and uninteresting as a kid, thought I'd give it another chance and... Yeah. Kid me wasn't wrong.

Riordan gets some of the myths wrong, picks and chooses which myths he wants to deal with, applies a magical world overtop the mundane randomly. Urban fantasy is a tough genre to maintain a consistent worldbuilding and a slapdash effort just reads poorly.

I kind of want to talk about ideology, which is something that I didn't really think about when I was a child. This book is chock full of American exceptionalism and support for ""Western civilization"". Is there a reason why Mount Olympus, a real mountain in Greece and the home of the gods, needs to be relocated to the top of the Empire State, a symbol of America? It couldn't have been, say, a mountain of some sort, if you had to write a story that appeals to American kids? Why are they in America now? Why is Hades in LA? It's kind of weirdly unearned cultural appropriation tbh.

Here's what I think. Spoilers ahead. The book makes three distinct references to Western civilization, about how the modern age began when Zeus took over Olympus, and about how the villain's goal is to take down Zeus and, by extension, western civilization. By tying the concept of godhood/divinity, and western civilization, and America, there is this unsubtle implication that America is the new seat of western civ because Olympus was where the old seat was, and therefore America is rightfully the seat of godhood and the center of the world.

Like.

Ok.

I will give him this though, the book probably is a really fun read for a kid with dyslexia or ADHD, and not just because the pacing is incredibly quick. Main characters have those traits and talk honestly about how difficult it can be. Representation is important."

Partir diciendo que no sabía nada sobre este libro; nunca vi las películas, ni leí algo sobre ellos, NADA. Y aun así ha logrado decepcionarme. Quizás mis expectativas me jugaron una mala pasada ya que, como dije, no tenia mucha idea de este libro, me imaginaba demasiada acción, guerra, mar, etc., y no ha habido nada de eso. Literal todo el libro es la misión de Percy acompañado de Annabeth y Grover. Si bien hay partes que si me mantuvieron medianamente enganchada, he tardado mas de una semana en leerlo, y me conozco y sé que si de verdad me hubiese gustado me lo habría terminado en dos-tres días máximo.

Pasando a los personajes, sí creo que están muy bien construidos, pero no me he vuelto muy fan de ellos. Annabeth fue mi favorita sin dudas, me encanto su historia y me emocionó en el final.

Para terminar, creo que los capítulos largos también jugaron una mala pasada, porque leía cinco paginas y lo dejaba de lado. casi para el final me plantee iniciar otro libro, pero sabia que si hacia eso nunca terminaría este y esa es la única razón por la que no lo hice, pero me moría de ganas. Creo que hay varias cosas que hicieron que esta lectura no fuese ni cerca de mis favoritas: el año, que entiendo que esto fuese muy famoso el año en que se publicó, pero a mi me aburrió esto de que siempre les pasara algo malo, que los traicionaran (siempre supe quién era el amigo que lo haría), en fin.

Y sí, planeo leer la segunda parte, a ver si mejora.

Pd: ame mucho, mucho (aunque fuese poco) lo que se mostró de la historia entre Sally y Poseidón.

Y aquí una interaccion entre Percy y Annabeth que me encantó too.

—No sé qué hará mi madre. Sólo sé que yo lucharé en tu bando.

—¿Por qué?

—Porque eres mi amigo, sesos de alga. ¿Alguna otra pregunta idiota?"
302,303,2,"I think the main problem with this book is that it came out after Harry Potter. If it was the other way around, I'd possibly enjoy it more, and not see it as a cheap HP rip off.

Anyway.

My eight year old absolutely fucking loves this series. She likes it better than Harry, and at her insistence, I started reading it to her and her younger sister at bedtime. To be fair, the first couple of chapters were very, very good, and I thought I was on to a winner. And then it all went a bit shit really.

Reading this book was a battle of bad-parent guilt vs saving some of my brain cells, as I struggled to read one of the most boring books I've ever come across. I found the character's dull, and lacking in any personality whatsoever. Oh, except for Annabeth who unfortunately reminded me of a watered down Hermione. After 300+ pages I did.not.give.a.crap. About Percy or his goat thing, or anyone else at Camp Halfblood.
I found the 'bad guys' tacky and cringe-inducing. A lot of people rate the monsters in their reviews, but the writing and dialogue was so poor, and yawn-inducing the 'fight scenes' and interactions became completely forgettable.

I could go on and on, and upset and offend many people who love this series, but I'd rather just celebrate that I've finally finished this damn book.
The idea of Percy Jackson/gods/monsters/adventure would work, and potentially be fucking great if it was by a different author. The writing does not give justice to the story, which is a shame.

I've given the book two stars. And they're purely for the fact that my kids LOVE this series, and anything that gets kids reading is 'good', and another star for sparking interest in Greek mythology."
303,304,2,"For a wide open, fairly free-form Y/A Fantasy novel, The Lightning Thief is remarkably unimaginative. Rick Riordan sets up a Harry Potter style scenario in which a misfit youth discovers that he is heir to a magical identity, then sets the story to autopilot, dropping in a miscellany of modern reimaginings of Greek gods and monsters against the wandering backdrop of a cross-country roadtrip.

The concept of intermixing ancient Greek mythology with modern America is curious, but Riordan provides no explanation—Greek mythology is apparently just ""real""—and the trappings of ancient Greece, from the monsters to the demi-gods seemingly lurk around every corner and behind every storefront, to a sheerly absurd degree. There is no explanation for the preponderance of mythological figures in modern America or why the characters encounter them so frequently. All of this adds up to a novel that feels forced and lazy, even in the context of frolicsome Y/A adventure.

Moreover, in a genre that is continuously growing and developing to encompass ever more culturally-relevant commentary (as in The Hate U Give or Unpregnant) Riordan's book stands out for its utter lack of big-picture meaning. What does The Lightning Thief say about culture, humanity, our planet, etc? Absolutely nothing; it's just a popcorn fest.

Taken as pure fluff then, The Lightning Thief is kind of fun. It was a quick, breezy read with a few laughs, no real surprises, and essentially nothing to say. For fans of Harry Potter and other discovery/coming-of-age adventure fantasies, it might serve as vaguely amusing filler, but there just isn't enough substance to be especially meaningful."
304,305,2,
305,306,2,"This story really disappointed me. Not only did I hear lots of positive things about it, but the idea seemed so promising.

Unfortunately the terrible writing was simply too awful to overlook. Not even a 12 year old boy is that vapid and detached from reality. I mean, if it's meant to sound like an actual talentless 12 year old boy wrote it, then sure, nailed it. But I had higher expectations than that. I expected the voice of an accomplished and talented author, instead I encountered writing that was barely tolerable.

The characters were unrelatable and unbelievable. The modernisations of Greek gods were largely ridiculous and the ease with which our protagonist conquers obstacles that fell greater heroes than he was enough to cause me injury from constant eye-rolling and face-palming.

I suppose if I were a ten year old child reading this I might find it easier to buy, but that's no excuse in my opinion. I read a great many children's books and none I've read recently have been as poorly executed as this one.

It really is unfortunate, as I said the concept was very interesting and I really wanted to love it and have a new series to eagerly consume. But apparently that was not to be. Percy Jackson is simply not the hero I'm looking for.

I've read reviews comparing this favourably to Harry Potter. I can't understand how anyone could judge them to be anywhere near the same league. The only way in which I would compare them is to illustrate the way in which a children's story should be handled and contrast it to this overrated mess."
306,307,2,"While I'm aware I would have probably loved this more if I had read it at a younger age I'm still disappointed it didn't hold up for me as an adult. I'm going to keep repeating myself so I'm not burned at the stake here. And before I complain more I'll just say that know Percy was very young. Still his character was super ignorant which drove me up the wall. He didn't believe in Gods which is fine but when his best friend sprouts goat legs he is immediately on board with it. Percy just doesn't have any likeable qualities to me which I can usually overlook with traits like arrogance or intelligence but he didn't have those either.

Honestly though the narrator of the audiobook might have made my review a little more harsh. Rick Riordan's voice for Percy was good but made him seem less likeable and goes overboard with all the other characters especially the olders ones.

Even with me not enjoying Percy's character I couldn't get invested in the rest of the group. The old Gods in the modern world was pretty cool concept and also how the author used bits of lore to make them a new persona.

The plot didn't hold up for me either. I daydreamed through most of the story. Would start fuming when Percy would stay at the elevator by himself or go into some sketchy places with the prickling at the back of his neck knowing good and well something is going to go wrong. I just wished he had one redeeming quality.

I'll probably try the next book though just because I enjoy the new old Gods. Maybe as Percy gets older and wiser I'll enjoy his story more too."
307,308,2,"What can I even say about this one...a book that has so much love and nostalgia attached to it by so many people, but I just can't enjoy it. This book, to me, is average.

This is quite an easy book to read, fast paced and to-the-point. The thing is, I don't think this always works to the story's favour. The first page feels cringey and immediately fails to grip me. It seems shallow and simplistic to the point that I feel the author is making fun of me. This is one of these books I found really hard to immerse myself in (though I did, eventually, hence the 2, 5 stars). Everything is so quickly laid out, characters and places and events, that I find myself not caring about anything that's happening and unable to become attached. Without meaning to, I find myself drawing comparisons between this book and other fantasy children's books that I consider infinitely superior to this, writing style and story-wise, like Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, His Dark materials, heck, even Molly Moon!

Specific things I disliked:

~how the plot moves forward using lazy tricks, like how sacks for the Hermes Overnight Express just happen to be in Medusa's lair, or how there just happens to be information on the DOA Recording Studios, right in Crusty's place, where Percy and the others entered completely by accident.

~While the Greek Gods supposedly move along with the 'western spirit' , their half-blooded offspring's brains are still somehow 'hardwired' to Ancient Greek, hence the dyslexia. So the Gods, whose first language is Ancient Greek, have adjusted to English just fine, but the demigods, whose first language is English, can't adjust? Unless the Gods are also dyslexic and we're just never told? To me, it just doesn't make sense. This one, though, I can forgive, since it brings dyslexia to the forefront and that's a cause I can absolutely get by.

~'funny' comebacks. Honest to god, some of these are painful. BUT, I can get past that, since there are some genuinely funny parts in this. Most of them, though...it just seems like the author was trying way too hard. I get that this is a children's book, but kids aren't stupid, y'know.


OK, now on to the good parts! I couldn't care less about Percy's character, but Grover is nice. Also, there are some fun conversations among Percy, Annabeth and Grover. They make a good team.









But, the absolute best scene in the whole book (for me) is the scene at Crusty's.






I'm giving just a small snippet here, since I can't type out the whole thing, but this scene, I think, captures the essence of the fun in Percy Jackson.

What else? Despite my disinterest in the beginning, I pulled through and eventually started enjoying this book. It did take me a few days to finish, but here we are! This is not a bad book. I dealt with it in a more critical manner than its returning readers. I think reading this as an adult for the first time made me see its cons way too harshly. I think it's a fun book if you read it way young, nice ADHD and dyslexia representation, interesting context. The promise of diversity is what actually drew me to this series; but considering my minimal enjoyment of this, I'm not sure whether I'll be continuing or not. Idk, I wish I'd read this in primary school. Are the rest of the books better?"
308,309,2,"Okay, well. Unpopular opinion here.
.
I’m so disappointed!! I expected to really enjoy this! I thought there was a chance I could love it. One of those series I just never got around to reading but always heard such amazing things about. And maybe the hype did it harm, but man?! I simply did not like this.
.
I found the whole thing felt pretty contrived. Fitting myths and mythological characters in where they could sorta kinda work. It was gimmicky. And I don’t mind a good gimmick when it’s done well. This was not.
.
I found the main characters completely flat and not at all compelling. None of them had unique or particularly likeable qualities, and not a single one experienced any growth or even a minor shift. The friendships were fabricated, with no meaningful or genuine events to make them make sense. In fact, neither of Percy’s friends really needed to be there. (They literally just stood there most of the time.) He could’ve done the whole thing himself without the story being any different at all.
.
I found it painfully predictable both episode to episode (because it was written as a series of repetitive episodic “surprise” encounters) and start to finish. The only places it ever really surprised me were where the writing got even less well done—where characters did things that made no sense at all or where plot points fizzled where they could’ve been something.
.
I can see why I might like it if I was a middle grade boy who’d never had the experience of other middle grade books that don’t cheap out on depth of character or well-woven plot. And yes, BOY, because it felt very much like it was written to appeal to young boys … to fit into a young boy’s naturally shallow understanding of anything outside of themselves—slave to what they’d expect, heavily tokenized and stereotyped, rather than giving them a fresh, thoughtful, or different perspective. But seeing yourself in Percy might feel good.
.
For this reason alone, I’m tempted to hold onto this until my son’s older so we can read it together. Maybe seeing it through his eyes will redeem it a bit. And I sincerely do hope that if we carry on with the other books in the series, maybe I’ll see some maturity in the writing that’ll help it all come together. I want to be on the bandwagon, really I do.
.
Sorry. I’m as bummed about it as you are."
309,310,2,"I had watched the film adaptation of this book and couldn't, for the life of me, understand why fans of the book hated the movie so much because I actually enjoyed the film. One of the major complaints the fans had was the film changed a lot from the source material; so, when I was looking for another series of books to read, I thought I might as well check this out. First, maybe I should have read the book instead of listening to the audiobook because I really didn't like Jesse Bernstein's narration of the audiobook; he read the novel like he lost a bet, I've listened to Wil Wheaton read 'Ready Player Two' with more passion and more commitment. Secondly, Bernstein's voice sounded too old for the 12-year-old Percy Jackson and on that point, I understand why fans of the novel disliked the film because in the film Percy was more high school age than middle school. Other than that, though, this book wasn't really all that interesting in the beginning, the story only got more engrossing by chapter forty and even then, the conclusion was a bit anti-climactic but then again, if this was the beginning of the series, you wouldn't have the ultimate showdown with Kronos like you would have in the film; so, that much I get. Overall, this book was just okay but that hasn't discouraged me from checking out the rest of the series; on the contrary, it has piqued my interest more to read the rest of the novels, which I guess would be what any author would want— for their readers to continue reading."
310,311,2,"Era da tanto che conoscevo (in linea generale) la storia di Percy Jackson. Mi sono decisa a leggere questa saga solo dopo aver visto i due film che ne sono stati tratti. E’ la prima volta che apprezzo un film più del libro, nonostante il romanzo sia molto più ricco di dettagli e di avvenimenti, non mi ha fatta impazzire.

Mi è piaciuta la storia e l’originalità dell’ambientazione, ma vi ho scorto troppi clichè da fantasy moderno, alcuni dei quali rimandano palesemente alla saga di Harry Potter, la mia preferita in assoluto (ammetto quindi, che il mio giudizio non è assolutamente imparziale). Non ho gradito particolarmente neanche il modo di approcciarsi alla mitologia, in particolare il fatto di mescolare quella greca e quella romana.

Ovviamente la mitologia romana si rifà molto a quella greca, ma avrei preferito ci fosse una vera distinzione tra le due e che l’autore avesse scelto di trattarne una più nello specifico. Trovo che questo abbia creato confusione, allo stesso modo la questione degli “dei greci e romani in america” non ha molto senso dal mio punto di vista. Trattandosi di un’antica religione e di una parte della cultura delle regioni che l’hanno praticata (anche se nell’antichità) non sono riuscita ad apprezzare l’interpretazione che ne da Riordan nel romanzo.

Per ora ho letto solo il primo, quindi non posso dire di aver un quadro completo dell’opera, ma per il momento ho ricevuto questa impressione. Prevedo ovviamente di leggerla tutta, e una volta finita pubblicherò una recensione più completa e dettagliata, e poi chissà, potrei anche cambiare idea!"
311,312,2,"I found it hard to suspend reason to enjoy this book as I read it with my 11-year-old. First of all, you’re going to tell me that the gods have been operating in secret for the last however many thousand years and they’re still the same crappy gods?! I get that the author is introducing the old mythology for a young audience but to have an entire pantheon of ancient gods that has not changed one iota for the better really bothers me. They’re still petty, capricious, and worst of all, procreating constantly with humans, enough to fill a summer camp. Oh those silly gods, the campers laugh. These campers who are all basically the same age and who come, each one, from a broken family made up of one serial and unpunished rapist and one human victim.

But let’s not discuss the inherent issues with that, because it’s a kids book. Oh wait, it’s a KIDS BOOK. I’m not a prude but this profoundly bothers me.

I was oddly bothered by the claim that America is the spirit of the flame of the West so all the gods moved here. And, disregarding their European past, they apparently don’t leave America. Or have sex with anyone but Americans now. And have absolutely nothing to do with bettering this country. Murica.

The monsters in this book are awesome! Loved the fights and our intrepid little heroes. But not enough to be able to suspend the overarching daddy and mommy issues that ruin just about everything else in the book. I may be the only one that feels this way. Does the author address any of this in the next books? Skip this and read Harry Potter."
312,313,2,"The Lightning Thief is a story about a boy named, Percy, that is a son of Poseidon. He only just finds out he is a demi-god when attacked by mythical creatures in search of Zeus's lightning bolt. All the Gods think Percy stole it but when his mom is taken, Percy is more worried about getting her back from Hades. He and his friends, Annabeth and Grover, go on a quest to find Persephone's pearls so that they can escape the Underworld. They arrive in the Underworld to tell Hades they don't have the bolt. Percy asks for his Mom back but in a scuffle finds the bolt in his shield. He frees his mom and leaves Grover behind. He then heads for Olympus to give back the bolt. Luke is there to stop him because he wants war. Luke is the lightning thief. This is a book based on the Greek Gods that is wildly popular among many kids. However, I do not recommend it as a class read because I found it to have stuffed characters with disabilities into slots in the book. Percy has dyslexia and ADHD. The story does not mention how Percy copes with there things, other than disappointing his mother and being an outcast. The only time these aspects of Percy are positive is when they are considered a part of his demi-god nature. His book seemed to have a negative view of disabilities in everyday life that I did not appreciate. Although, I do recommend having this book in the library because it is a popular kids book that may encourage kids to read more."
313,314,2,"All in all, this was a great story in the sense that it seamlessly wove Greek mythology into the 21st century and I can understand why this series has been a hit.

However, a few things I had issues with -

1) The fact that Medusa was disguising herself as a veiled Muslim woman:

""I will just be a moment,"" Aunty Em said. ""You know, I can't see you very well in this cursed
veil....""

""Wrong?"" Aunty Em said, reaching up to undo the wrap around her head. ""Not at all, dear. I
have such noble company tonight. What could be wrong?""

What is wrong with Western men wanting to unclothe Eastern women, and why do they have so many opinions on women's clothes, wherever they are from? Why can't everyone just wear what they want to wear without being further alienated? I'm glad the movies didn't portray Medusa like this, clearly someone there had some sense.

2) Too many similarities to Harry Potter - invisibility ""cap"", a group of three going to defeat the bad guys with a clever girl, goofy guy, and brave but disturbed lead, dreams where you're actually looking through your enemies eyes, facing a three headed dog together, half-bloods, a school for magical children, a horrible influence at home, an oracle i.e. woman in hippy clothes who tells you a prophecy, the return of an ancient evil...aaand the list goes on. Yes the story still flows but one would have to be blind to say that ALL these similarities are simple coincidences.

Overall a 2.5/5 from me."
314,315,2,"I thought about giving The Lightning Thief a 3-star rating because I was scared of having people being upset with me for not loving the first Percy Jackson installment. But as I thought more about it, I can't say that I'd ever read this book again.

I may read the second one because I've seen that the reviews are higher than this one, but it's not going to be the next thing I pick up. Here are my thoughts on why I didn't enjoy the book as much as I expected to.

Percy Jackson seems like the type of book that you have to pick up at the right time. I believe in good timing when it comes to reading, and I think I may have waited too long to start reading this series. There are certain books in my life that are staples in my library because I read them at the exact right time in my life. Percy Jackson, unfortunately, isn't one of those books.

The characters seemed bland to me. Annabeth was stereotypical, Grover had no admirable qualities, and the rest of the cast blends together in the background. Percy was my favorite character overall because of his occasional sarcastic comment, but he's not a character that I would rank in my all-time favorite list.

I think I had too high of expectations for the book, and they were let down because of my inability to really immerse myself in this world."
315,316,2,"As soon as I picked this book up I could not put it down I was completely sucked into Riordan’s god filled world. The reason I decided to read this book was because of my interest in history and the overwhelmingly positive reviews I had heard about it. This book exceeded all expectations I had by a land slide. The story was great full of action and twists and turns filling it all in with an amazing combination of modern and historical settings. I did not see any personal connections in the story except for the main character and I sharing a case of ADHD. (Haha banter). The theme of this story is trust because the main characters often have to trust each other’s actions to survive some of the terrifying monsters they expierence through out, and an ultimate betrayal shows the value of trust. The authors use of teenager language makes it an easy and enjoyable read for kids that may have lost their zeal for reading due to dull adult language. This book is definitely aimed at teenagers, but could be enjoyable for all ages. The language makes it fresh and natural sounding that teenagers can understand. The adventure keeps the reader riveted to the book unable to put it down. Some adults may find it childish, but to younger readers they will be brought into a fantasy world they may never want to leave."
316,317,2,"Was curious to see what all the fuzz was about, also wanted to read something easy to start 2021 with. Been in a reading slump since nov 2020, but can't say this really helped much.

In a world in which the greek gods are powerfull but extremely dumb a young halfblood boy has to go on a quest to set matters right he didn't even have a hand in...no really they're incredibly stupid.
'Let's blame this 12 year old boy who didn't even knew he was a half god until about a few days ago that he stole my precious lightning!'
'....securitycamera's are a thing nowadays ya know?'
'Shut up being logical and stuff. Blaming this boy's more fun anyway :DD'
I guess children can just casually stroll in to Olympus and steal the most powerfull weapons in existence, without saids gods realising this until the thief's long gone?

It follows a very predictable pattern: traveling-resting-oh no something's off-a monster appears!-battle time-monster defeated. Rinse and repeat.

I did like the first 60 or so pages, it sucked me in I had to admit. Then it got stale pretty fast, after Percy and co left the camp, it just all went down the drain. I have to admit that it picked up near the end but oh no the twist with a certain person happened and I was done. I finished it, might pick up book 2 but so far not impressed."
317,318,2,"To put it plainly, this is not a Harry Potter — I mean, it is not a book that hooked me, consumed me, or actively made me want to read it. If anything, I found it quite annoying. I understand it is supposed to be a silly children’s book that also teaches facts about Greek mythology and stuff in a digestible way, but it was just soooo stereotypey and rather lazy in characterisation I found myself internally cringing multiple times.

The characters are so cliche, their personalities all revolve around their parents’ ‘positions’ (not to be a nerd, but that is also a narrow way to perceive polytheistic gods, as they were not confined to one ‘skill’, more like had preferences… hobbies, of sorts), all of their actions NEED to match their family tree, etc. I found them to be so two-dimensional, like I UNDERSTAND Annabeth is smart and Percy is rebellious but don’t they deserve to have some personality outside the prescribed traits?

Another thing I really disliked is the info dumping. I KNOW it’s a children’s book but even children can understand a thing or two without a wall of exposition every two dialogue lines. Got on my nerves a little.

The curses aren’t funny, the situations made me raise an eyebrow at best, the narration is dry for my tastes, etc. Not a fan of this one.

2.5/5

Christmas 22"
318,319,2,"Read most of this series almost a decade ago because the thing to do when you're twelve is to do what everyone else does. And I got through the first four of these before stopping. Not because they were terrible. In fact, I loved the characters: Percy's snark, Annabeth's sheer brilliance, Grover's adorable strangeness. But they felt too much like another literary trio for me. And I mean, the most iconic friend trio of our time: Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley. It's a magic sort of formula for a core character group, so it's no surprise that it would be mimicked, but it's been done before, so it's nothing too spectacular here. Just as it wouldn't be anything spectacular anywhere else.

I also thought that the use of the Greek mythology to be lifeless. They were just moved to a modern setting, but nothing was really changed to reflect the continually shifting conditions of our world. You could find the same characters and situations in a collection of the original myths, which is what I went and did. It's more impressive to show how older stories have the ability to change with the times rather than remain stagnant, I think, and though this can be considered an introduction to Greek mythology, I know for a fact that kids can understand the important concepts of the stories, whether they are being re-examined to fit the modern world or simply repackaged and called something new."
319,320,2,"I understand that this book was written for the author's child and students. He was trying to make it friendly to kids with dyslexia and have a hero with ADHD. However, the thinly veiled myth lessons spoken from the mouths of children didn't sound right. In fact, often what the children said didn't sound like contemporary children. I also didn't like some of the ways he talked about ADHD, and tried to equate it to misunderstood superhero/demigod powers. The idea could be good, but I don't think it was executed well. There were parts where my son was wide eyed or laughed, but overall I don't think either one of us were that drawn into the world. I hear the stories get better, but I'm not sure we will care to read one for awhile. It is not fun to read out loud with all of the simple phrasing of he said, she said, random action scene, joined by more he said, she said. The most interesting offering is probably Percy's mother, and the implication there is a larger adult world of complex sacrifice. Percy will come of age through seeing the world(s), rather than his attempts at outsmarting gods and titans. Hopefully, this theme gets developed in future books, because the characters are still rather flat. Do NOT bother with the abomination of a movie."
320,321,2,"2.5/5

I read this with my younger brother, and it was quite a fun story to read together. Riordan's take on Olympus and Hell were both very innovative, and the concept of a camp for demigods was a clever one. I'm sure the characters and the locations will get fleshed out as the series progresses, but I do wish that more time was spent at each location, fleshing out the surroundings, and giving us a clear sense of the timeline the children were operating within.

But also, this is middle grade / young adult, and having read a lot of adult fantasy and gotten used to a more slow, dense style of writing, this book felt incredibly fast paced, and at times, quite confusing. A lot of the Greek Mythology is slotted in, in a way that makes sense to those who grew up studying Greek Mythology in school, which I did not. This didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book but I do feel I would have understood the relationships between the Gods and the severity of the situation, had I known them. (I did know a couple things though, like Persephone's story and the myth of sisyphus, etc).

Overall, I'm probably not the target demographic for this series (which I knew going in) but I still enjoyed it."
321,322,2,"Great plot, lazy writing

So...
My nieces and nephews love this series, so I jumped into it to see what the fuss is about.
I understand that not everyone can write Harry Potter, but this book felt like exposition held together by lazily built characters.
It limps along with retellings of the stories of Greek gods, but doesn't give much freshness to the story or bring anything new to the realm of fantasy story telling.
Okay main problem with this book is that the target audience is preteens. The continuous underlying narrative of bad people as old fat ugly people (Not only is Percy's step father ugly and smelly, he's called Uglioni), there is also the never ending quest to save the ""Western World."" Seeing as the book is based in America, the utter lack of black or Asian characters is jarring, but then again it goes to show a lot about the gods' preferences? The only mention of Africa is in relation to starvation.
Maybe the next books in the series will improve?
I realise all this complaining is moot seeing as the series is already a movie series, but hopefully the screen writers will massage some of the problems out.
Will definitely be reading the rest of the series, but planning to keep rolling my eyes as I do so."
322,323,2,"eh I didn't like how the middle eastern woman who covered her face, and had a middle eastern accent, was the same one who Percy was uncomfortable around because he couldn't see her face. also of course she then turned out to be Medusa.
because of course the middle eastern woman who has her face covered turned out to be a monster. yay fun.

also there was so much talk about how the only great civilizations were the western ones, and it's kind of stupid, because you've had great Empires from everywhere in the world that has nothing to do with the western world. nope. I did not like that one bit.

also most of the things that happened in this book could've been avoided if the kids weren't so god damn stupid. why do you keep trusting everyone when EVERYONE you've met throughout the book tried to kill you and stuff?

also the ""plottwist"" in the end was totally predictable. but oh well, it's a children's book.

I died laughing at some of the jokes. and the pacing was quite all right. but honestly the stuff mentioned above bothered me enough that I don't really want to give it more than two stars.

This is my first time reading Percy Jackson, and I don't know what I think. Maybe I would've liked it more if I read it as a kid. probably."

now i know why the actor playing percy jackson is soooo thrilled. this will likely be the new harry potter - each book getting a movie - so he's in for fame, money, stardom, more money, women, and more money still.

actually, i really enjoyed the book as i was clipping along. i can see the appeal to young readers, and i turned my son on to the book by telling him the first few chapter titles (), and then reading the first few papragraphs aloud. for awhile we were tag-team reading. when i wasn't using it, he was reading it and - hey - if it gets boys to read - all the more power to it.

the problem came when i put it down for a day or two. it lost momentum for me. i guess i can't re-enter fantasy after i've been away from it, but i don't think that will be a problem for boys.

btw - i read this for book club. i wouldn't have read it otherwise, and that's what's good about someone else choosing your book - you get a broader view than you would on your own. so now fierce has found a whole new series"

325,326,2,"Looking back, this book wasn't so good... it was part of the Harry Potter rush where every publisher wanted Harry Potter with the serial numbers filed off. This one was clearly rushed and written by a guy who didn't remember what it was like to be a kid, so the things in it were more like a grownup saying ""this is what kids like, right?"" and then totally missing the mark. For example, the Hogwarts equivalent here was a ""summer camp."" What? That's stupid. Just make it a school. It's trying too hard to be ""cool"" and ""hip"" with young people. ""Kids like summer camp, right?"" Uh, no. Kids like things that are different, and summer camp is different. Looking back summer camp sucked. This is clearly a grownup attempting to be ""cool"" for kids. The book is full of stuff like this. I do think Riordan got better as he went, and he's certainly more productive of a writer than Rowling, but he doesn't hold a candle to her on either storytelling or on a sentence craft level, and frankly also is inferior to his source material (Greek Myth). For people who were not already into myth, I can see this book is an entry point to get them more interested in myth, and therefore I am grateful. But for people like me who were already interested in myth, these books are annoying."
326,327,2,"To really appreciate this, it would have helped me to have more knowledge of Greek mythology than I do.
Two stars? Three stars? I read this because it has been read by grandchildren. With this in mind, it gave me concerns. One, do our children clearly understanding the mythology of Greek gods? Another, are they mature enough to process the marriage and reproduction between the gods and humans? Hopefully, middle-graders can give the story the lack-of-credibility it deserves.

The adventures of endearing demigod Percy (Perseus) and his like companions half-god Annabeth and satyr Grover were pretty tedious for two-thirds of the story (thus the two stars). The last portion picked up for me enough to make it interesting and to wonder what happens next in the series. I don’t care enough to see, at least for now.

Though I have read and enjoyed some fantasy, I guess I am not that ""into"" this sort.

(A bit of humor? At least the bias of the writer! In the Fields of Punishment, ""I could see people being chased by hellhounds, burned at the stake, forced to run naked through cactus patches or listen to opera music."" 😟)

327,328,2,"well I just realised after posting the first review, that I never added this book even to my ""read"" shelf. Oops. But I think it is a perfect analogy for how I feel about this book (and series, so far). I only ever hear great things about those books:
""great read, even if it's a childrens book"" - it really doesn't talk down to the reader.... I don't feel that way when reading. Sorry. Not at all.
""I love those charakters, they are so perfect for this story and always refreshing to read about"" - even after not only reading the first book in this series, and seeing that charakters get written out frequently to keep things new... I can't say that. I couldn't care less for any of those charakters to this point. (with one exeption where I was like 'yeah ok, he is kinda nice'... Tyson if you want to know. second book)
etc. etc.
The only thing I can kinda understand is the hype about the modernised turnes of mythes and mythology. That's kinda neat. But not more. I could just read the originals and think about it for two seconds more. Not to be mean.
Anyways... yeah I don't know. We will see. Maybe someday I warmed up to those books. Who knows"
328,329,2,"I read this book because I was curious to know what my 6th grade granddaughter was reading as part of the required curriculum. I am also always interested in the messages below the obvious themes and plots in books for this age level since they tend to ""color"" how young people see the world. In general, the Lightning Thief captures a pretty diverse world across gender and disability and where pretty much everyone is portrayed as a fully developed character. And, although Percy is the titular protagonist, there are many heroes. However, the lack of racial or ethnic diversity is troubling, as is the clear preeminence of western civilization. Although it is only one of many books that my granddaughter will read, combined with similar themes she's covering in social studies and geography, my African American female 6th grader needs to see herself represented and included as much as any other child. So, as usual, parents for children of color need to do the extra work of correcting and supplementing the standard educational curriculum and pedagogy. Always necessary and increasingly tiring."
329,330,2,The book is for kids and as an adult i don't think it is that good of a read.If you are a kid then go for this book without any second thoughts . To clarify I am a harry potter fan and i have also read them as an adult(yes i was a stupid kid who didn't read any books). So if you are a kid then go for this book without a second thought you will absolutely love it i wish read it in my childhood but as an adult it was not a very great experience. The similarities to the harry potter is painfully obvious.It is also too much fast paced for me.
330,331,2,"DNF. The whole ""Greek myth meets modern life"" concept ought to have been fun, but it is not. There are too many characters, none of which I am made to care about. Every young main character's father or mother has a tragic back story which we, as readers, are apparently supposed to know about (I was never taught about Greek mythology in school), but the main characters themselves fail to have any personality. Who is Annabelle? Who is Percy? They are devoid of any character.

Then there was the plot. A lot happened, and yet nothing happened at all. None of the things that happened at the theme park, the camp and at the various other American locations that I have already forgotten advanced the plot. I still don't know entirely what the main characters' main goal was.

Then there was the depiction of the various villains. Oh boy. If a new character got described as ""ugly"", you could be certain they would end up being a villain, because all ugly people are bad, am I right? Additionally, I fail to understand why the writer turned Medusa (a villain) into a “middle eastern” “gown-wearing” woman. It just struck me as vaguely islamophobic."

Aïe je pensais pas mettre aussi peu pour ce premier tome, mais j'ai vraiment pas accroché à cette histoire.
Le 0.5 va pour l'humour, qui est plutôt réussi, caustique.

Malheureusement je pense que je ne suis plus la cible pour ce middle grade, la hype doit être passée. J'ai pas trouvé les personnages très attachants ou très développés. Alors oui ils sont jeunes mais je m'attendais à plus les aimer.
L'intrigue autour des Dieux, de l'Olympe et compagnie ne m'a pas vraiment plus. J'ai trouvé ça brouillon par moment.

Le rythme est lent, alors que les personnages sont, dans pratiquement tous les chapitres, confrontés à un nouveau monstre ou une créature à battre. C'était trop fouilli et on se perd par rapport à la quête principale. L'auteur a voulu mettre plein d'action mais ça rendait le tout instable et le rythme brouillon.

J'avoue qu'arriver à la fin je n'en pouvais plus, il m'a fallu plusieurs semaines pour finir car je n'avais pas envie d'y retourner. Les derniers chapitres ont été lus en diagonal 😩
Je ne sais pas si je lirai la suite, en tout cas si oui, ce ne sera pas maintenant. (Pourquoi est ce que j'ai acheté la saga en entier ? 😆)"
332,333,2,"no because what made you think this was 4.30? Is it because it read well or was it because it was nostalgic? Is it because it’s the bones of Harry Potter wrapped up in subpar wrapping?

Do I understand that most writing is the same story over and over again? Yes, I’ve read How to Read Literature Like a Professor. I went through that. But this felt waaaaay to close for comfort. This felt like someone trying to ride on the tailcoats of another series and make their money off of it.

The book went by way too fast for the gravity of the events that went down. And don’t even get me started on the Medusa plot — she wasn’t dating Poseidon, he raped her. She wasn’t running off to see her boyfriend. You’re saying you can write a kids book with a bunch of “half-bloods” who know their parents sleep around quite often, talk about a 12 year old slaying and BEHEADING someone, but the rape thing is too far for a kids book?

And the idea that the gods are always falling for the same things as the myths was silly to me. So you’re saying that everyone KNOWS the myths and tales but the gods aren’t capable of seeing these same traps pop up over and over again? Give me a break."
333,334,2,"2 stars = it was ok.
And it was, really - but that's just it. It wasn't good or bad, just meh. I knew very little about greek mythology going in, but I knew enough to be able to predict every single thing that happened in the book. No surprises, no plot twists. It was so all over the place too, they were attacked every five minutes. I know it's written for kids, but that's no excuse, we shouldn't dumb things down for 12 year olds (most of the ones who read are smart anyway.)
The thing that annoys me the most is how detailed these fucking descriptions are, and how bad Riordan is at using adjectives and adverbs. He oversimplifies and over-explains everything to the point of me wanting to rip my hair out, the rest of the writing is just dull and flavourless. I've heard it gets better in like book three, and I gave City of Bones 2 stars too, but I still decided to read the entire series, and it has gotten better. So yeah, we'll see. Wasn't that impressed by this one though, maybe I'm not really the fantasy type."
334,335,2,"Percy Jackson is a troubled 12 year old boy who is trying to find his way in order to make his mother proud. He has behavior issues in school and tends to hang out with a weird crew of friends. To his surprise, one day, when he realizes his best friend is a satyr (a man with goat ears, tail, legs, and horns), his world gets flipped upside down when his world becomes engulfed with legends. Percy's world becomes full of satyrs, centaurs, and The Olympians (Greek gods).

Although I did not enjoy the book myself, I think that it was well written for the audience that the book was written for. I think that students (3rd-8th, maybe older) would be able to relate to Percy in the beginning of the story where he is a troubled student, trying to make his mother happy and stay out of trouble. Percy would be a role model for students who can realize that there is a world waiting for them outside of school. Percy still attends school and does his adventuring over the summer months, but he still gives the influence that school is still important."
335,336,2,"I chose to read this book because this novel is my little brothers favorite. I had also read half of it in 6th grade. I didn’t remember much so I wanted to refresh my memory on it. I needed to read 12 books of my choice in my class so I picked this as one of them. I would recommend this book to the younger age who are interested in Greek mythology.

How I would use this in a middle school classroom is to have it as a selection on my shelf. I don’t think I would make it a must read but it is something entertaining for both boys and girls. Many novels that a class may read don’t always interest boys due to them feeling most plots are mushy. I know that is what I experienced with my guy classmates in school while hearing their opinions on books we had to read. I feel this book will appeal to lots of students.

336,337,2,"I realise I am not the target audience but I have read middle school books that were still simply good reads. Also, I lack the nostalgia factor, since I have never read the books before.

The story is interesting enough but the book is just... so slow... and unrealistic... and I am not talking about Gods etc. but a 12 year old who doesn't even cry once despite all the things that were happening. A 12 year old who was never trained properly but is better than all the kids that have been in training for years? And despite the daughter of Athena supposedly being wise, it's Percy who comes up with most plans... uhm... ok...


I hope the next books might get better.

Well, I DNFed Harry Potter 1, so it's got that going for itself."
337,338,2,"2 Stars means “It was okay”. That’s all I can say about this book really: it was okay...

For a book where the protagonist is a twelve year old, it surprised me how mature he was at some points. Don’t get me wrong you never forgot he was twelve but when comparing him to the twelve year olds I know in real life, he made mature decisions and put others before himself.

The book did have some plot twists but some of them I saw coming a mile off - probably comes with the fact that I’m about 15 years above its target audience. But it was, overall, a pleasant(ish) easy read. An okay book.

I’ve have actually read this book before a good few years ago and straight afterwards I’d added it to my Not Interested pile and never looked back. However, I recently read an article on series of books where the first book is the worst but they get much much better and I thought to myself “I must give all these series a go”.

And so I did and here I am, rereading this first book so I can continue with the series to see if it gets any better. Wish me luck."
338,339,2,"I liked the movie more. Oop don’t attack me.
I’ll be honest I was bored during the majority of this. I didn’t really connect with the characters at all but that’s probably because they are 12. The plot was all over the place. Only thing I liked was how Riordan made it seem ok and cool to have ADHD and dyslexia which I bet made a lot of kids feel better about themselves. I really should have read this when I was a kid not a 19 year old. But like, I enjoy kid stuff so I don’t understand why it’s not hitting as hard as I thought it would. This series but YA would fuckin slap. Anyways I’ve got the rest of the series to go so maybe it’ll get better.
Grover was a pussy. He needs sass like in the movies.
I understand now though why the Percy Jackson fandom HATES the movies so much tho because it basically completely strayed from the book. If that happened with a sarah j maas adaption I would puke and have a fit. Buuut still I preferred the movie way more. We’ll see how the next book holds up."
339,340,2,"Maybe I'm just past the age where this would be a defining series, but I simply do understand the popularity of the PJO series, particularly within my own peer group.

From the writing style, to the predictable twists (minus the unnecessary last chapter that felt like Riordan simply forgot about the last part of the Oracle prophecy until it was almost too late), and the sheer unlikability of Percy himself, I don't get it.

I have been urged to continue at least the first series, however, and I have considered doing so. Again, I may simply have missed the opportunity to read this book at the right time. Many readers my age are as obsessed with this series as they are with series like Harry Potter, and I had hoped that I would at least find some enjoyment in the Greek Gods and some sense of nostalgia - unfortunately, I was wrong.

My main concern with this book, however, is the way it is written. I very much did not enjoy having Percy speak directly to me through his narration. It was jarring and unnecessary, and brought me out of the story rather than assisted in immersing me in it."
340,341,2,"Well, at first I was seriously thinking about quitting reading the book. It seemed like it was written by a little child and the plot was really silly. But I got over it and convinced myself to go on. The whole thing continued to be boring and unenjoyable till the moment Percy got to the Underworld. Then it all became a bit more interesting, but still nothing I would seek out. Maybe this book just wasn't made for me.
Despite all that, everybody says that the latter sequels are better, so for a second I played with a thought of reading the next book, but than I came to my senses. NEVER GONNA HAPPER!
Regarding the movie, I think that this is one of the very few cases where the film version is actually better. It was more thrilling and by making the characters older and giving them more opportunities to do stuff (like driving a car) it made the whole thing simpler and more elegant. Besides every book/movie needs a good ship and it would be quite weird shipping twelve year olds."
341,342,2,"This book really is not my taste, not even if read this when I was younger (as I was horse crazy and rarely read other books). I'm happy that these books appeal to so many young readers, even though I don't like some of the popular authors I love how they bring the magic of reading to so many people. Most of the time I was bored reading this, and I got annoyed at some of the plot/actions of the characters. One part was if Percy's mother knew that he is in danger why not send him to fighting/fencing classes, or anything would have been better then nothing. Percy also didn't seem too sad about someone close to him dying. And then the ending... How they were going to wait until after the summer before doing anything about... You know who... Like the danger will wait until they were ready to go on their next quest. I'm glad I finally read this though as know I won't feel tempted to buy the whole box series (like I have a few times) and guilty for not trying to read them."

I have had this book since I was in elementary school. I would always read up to the pink poodle chapter, and then stop, never finishing it. I am now 19 going on 20 and I decided to read it to see what the hype was all about. I have to cut it some slack because it WAS a lower level read but I think the way it was written could have been a lot better. It seemed to just repeat the same events over and over again and the foreshadowing was so clear, I always knew what would happen next. I think the plot was so interesting and had so much potential that was wasted. I wish the scenes where he is discovering his powers had been more descriptive and enticing. It would have been fun to look more into Annabeth and Grover's powers as well.
I heard the writing gets better as the books continue and as the kids grow up, so I will be reading more of the series."
345,346,2,"""Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief"" by Rick Riordan is set in a world that immediately captured my interest. However, I found the writing style and storytelling ability of the author pretty mediocre. While the book's intended audience of children may not have noticed, I as an adult reader found the characters to be onedimensional and often acting irrationally in many situations. Additionally, the story lacks a ""wow"" factor that would elevate it to greatness.

Despite my disappointment with the first book, I was surprised to find that many adults raved about the series. I suspect this may be due to a sense of nostalgia or a fondness for the setting. I will reserve final judgment until I've read more of the series, as the main characters may become more enjoyable as they age and mature. For now, however, I can only give 2.4 out of 5 stars, as I appreciated the concept and setting, but was not satisfied with the execution and writing style of the book."

I feel like this is one of those times that if I had read this when I was younger or even 2 years ago I would have liked it at least a little bit more, so maybe it was a bit of a right book, wrong time sort of thing but yeah I just really couldn’t get into it and by the end I don’t even know if I was actually reading anything because I was so bored.

It’s not even the fact that it’s Greek mythology because I did like the the Greek mythology side of it, I think that’s the only reason I gave it 2 rather than a 1."

There are a lot of moral issues embedded in this book that I think it is a bad influence on younger readers. Especially if you are an atheist like me, the ideologies of this book infringes on my beliefs and my children. I do not want them to be influenced by the ""gods"" in this story. Additionally, my son has ADHD. In this story, those who have this conditions are demigods. This book ridicules my son's serious disease and the challenges that go with it.

As for the story, it was alright, so I am giving it 2 stars."
349,350,2,"It's field trip day for the middle school and Percy Jackson has a strange super-human encounter with one of his more hostile teachers. This is just one of a long list of his public school struggles, as an overall misfit with an irritating home life, few friends, and an vague understanding of his parentage. We're not far into the book when Percy finds himself at Camp Half Blood, and there he begins to put the pieces together relating to the origins of his strange and unpredictable powers.

For me personally? Big 'MEH.' It just isn't my genre. But I will say it was pretty well-written, not boring to listen to, relatable for the tweens and teens, a clean and entertaining read. Oh, also it bugged me greatly that the chapter titles basically told you exactly what was going to happen in that chapter. :o|"
350,351,2,"While reading this book I wasn't as interested and engaged in the book as I thought I would be. I think this is for multiple reasons. First I didn't like the character of Percy as much. I didn't like the typical hero he is and how cliche some parts where. I have heard a lot about this book and how good it was but I don't think it met my standards. I think this was because this book was meant for younger people in general. I think if I read this book a couple of years ago, I would have enjoyed it more. The basic story was bland and I thought it could be more interesting. I think if I knew more about Greek mythology, I would understand more of the book and hence understand it more. I may read the second book of the story to see if it was just the first book I did not like. I am having high hopes since many of the books in the series are liked by the majority of people."
351,352,2,"I knew I was in trouble here when the book started glorifying “western civilization,” which gave me some slightly-creepy coded racism vibes. I enjoy Greek (and other) mythology, usually, and this book did hold my attention well enough in the latter half, but even aside from the fact that this is a (middle grades) children’s book, I was less than deeply impressed. It felt like an attempt to capture the trappings of Harry Potter without the narrative skill. I liked the representation aspect, the spinning of traditional “disabilities” into the harbingers of super powers, but I still couldn’t like the characters that much. And although the “odyssey” aspect of the book felt appropriate to a Greek myth universe, and the ultimate reveal was age appropriate for middle grades readers, these were not handled in a way that felt particularly compelling to me."
352,353,2,"As a kid, this series of books were probably just my favorite thing ever. The mythology aspect intrigued me so much, and the characters were well made. But looking back on it, the writing in these books is crap. Half of the “mythology” in it is made up by the author, and it’s just so damn repetitive. Let’s start with the writing. The only way the author can ever creat anything like suspense, it’s only when one main character is keeping something from another for no damn reason. Next the myths. What the frick is the mist? If you read actual stories from mythology and go into these books, you will find way too many discrepancies. I’m tired rn so I can’t think of the other crap I was goin to say, so I rate this book a g for good when you were really little and couldn’t tell good from bad writing but now it sucks."
353,354,2,"Honestly, I didn't like this and I was hoping to like it more but it was more of a children's book than I was expecting. I have the whole series on my shelves so maybe I'll try and read the remainder of the series at some point but I'm glad I read (listened) to this.

This moved way too quickly and it was great to see so many Greek gods but by the same token and I get that this is a kids book so it needs to move quickly but by the same token it would've been good to linger on these gods for a while. I also think the narrator was annoying but that's not really the book's fault, it just took away from my enjoyment.

Maybe I need to try the YA series but I've got a weird taste in my mouth now from reading this. I think I would've loved this growing up so it's a shame I missed out on this."
354,355,2,"Okay, so I really wanted to like this book. I think I would have if three things had been different:

1. If I knew anything about Greek Mythology. I only recognized 3 names total, and the author didn't explain anything about the ones I didn't recognize. I think they wrote it for people who already know and love Greek Mythology, not people who come in clueless

2. If I was younger. The writing style was very basic. Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't read a super well written adult level book right before?

3. If the kids had better attitudes. Their snarkiness and disrespect for adults and for each other really bothered me (that's something that always bothers me in kids books, though)

All that said, I can see why kids who are into Greek mythology really love these books! They're good, just not the books for me."
355,356,2,"Two stars for the star of this book, Annabeth! Thank you for making this book bearable, but just barely.

The writing and the plot didn’t bother me. I thought they were good! What did bother me is the uncomfortable ideologies present in the story. Sexism, ableism, American nationalism.

I felt like I was sold the idea of an epic journey, not a cross country road trip with the occasional Greek monster.

I feel like the Greek mythology elements were also pretty… basic. It would have been interesting to see Riordan’s own take on Greek myths. Why the heck couldn’t Mount Olympus stay in Greece instead of a floating mountain cap hovering over New York because Western civilization is strongest in America or something? I guess that’s technically Riordan’s take on Greek myth… maybe I’ll take basic after all."
356,357,2,"Probably should’ve read this a few years back as it’s meant for a younger audience, but reading it now after I read mythological-fiction books such as Circe by Madeline Miller or basically any other unrelated, well written book, this was quite disappointing. It took me way too long to force myself to read since I got the whole plot halfway through. Though I should probably say that if you don’t have any knowledge of the myths beforehand that might not be such as issue for you. Even if the author can’t stop themselves from foreshadowing literally EVERYTHING all the time. Haven’t decided if I’m gonna read the next book. Just so you know if you’re looking for something like Harry Potter this could be nice for you but it’s just a kids book so don’t get as hyped up from the internet as I did about it because it’s just disappointing."
357,358,2,"Did you know this is not good if you didn't read it as a child? I don't begrudge anyone who has liked this since childhood, but I will not be able to adopt it in my life now.

Engaging enough that I want to know the plot of all the other books but I actually find the whole concept has aged very poorly and honestly feels offensive--to bring Greek mythology into the present and basically assert ""Western culture is good and correct and true"" and to not even grapple with the inherent racism of that, not to mention the more pointed references about WWII and the fact that Thomas Jefferson is someone who judges your soul in the afterlife ... it's giving the ick. I hate when books try to flit over the oppression of real people by making their white characters live in some loophole fantasy world.

Really wish I could have liked this!"

We just finished it and while I love that it got him excited to read, I wasn't the biggest fan. It bothered me that there was so much sarcasm and sassiness between characters, lots of negative teen attitudes, and portrayals of dysfunctional families. It just rubbed me the wrong way. And while my kids loved that there was so much action, it kind of bothered me that each chapter they were facing a new monster to fight. It was exhausting! But, my kids liked learning about Greek mythology so I guess that was the one redeeming quality. My son has read the entire series, but I don't see us listening to any more of them in the car."

I did like the idea that his being ADHD / dyslexic was a symptom of his half blood. Other than that - I really didn't like Percy, he's so freaking oblivious. It feels like the Harry Potter books again - here's a makeover of ideas that have been written better by other authors in the past, this time pulling on mythology rather than fantasy literature, that at least it gets the kids reading, and I rather expect there's fanfic out there that's better than the original. But it's making my daughter happy that I read it, and in exchange I'm getting her to read some good stuff, so that's worth it."

Because they too are about an eleven year old boy and was originally written for young children.I heard some booktuber gushing about it and saying how much they loved this series so I decided to give it a go,but was totally disappointed.

I’m not saying it’s bad but I think if I had read it back when I was 12 to 15 myself, I would’ve liked it a lot better but now at 24 I’m just too old to be reading this and I have to say that,sadly,I did not enjoy it or like it a lot.I did watch the movie a few years ago and liked it very much,and I ha e watched Clash of the Titans and that movie was incredible so the book just couldn’t impress me."
361,362,2,"I read this aloud with my son and while we enjoyed it together and wanted to read to the end, I have to say there wasn't much of this book that felt really original or truly well and/or compellingly written. It took me a long time to get on board with Percy as a character, the mom instinct in me wanted to run away fast and read something with more depth, something more classic. I'm not feeling the pull to read more of this author's work at all, but for my son, I would of course; still...I think we can reach for better writing. I will say learning more about the Greek gods has always been something I've wanted to do (my son is really enjoying his Greek gods unit in school) and this certainly got me thinking about that."
362,363,2,"-1.5 stars- I truly thought I would love this book because it integrated Greek mythology which is really appealing to me, but I was fooled due to the high ratings. I didn't particularly like any character, nor was I interested in what's going to happen to them, half of the time I was reading this book I was reminded by Harry Potter, even though I didn't read the books, it felt like Percy was similar to Harry in some ways, but what disappointed the most is the way Greek mythology was portrayed, it felt too americanized..Everytime the author would describe a certain God I didn't feel its awe it seemed just like a regular person. I honestly wanted to read the whole series but unfortunately I'm not going to continue with it, due to my disinterest in knowing what's going to happen next."
363,364,2,"I enjoyed reading most of the popular teenage fictions like Hunger Games, Harry Potter and Divergent series but this just wasn't it. I picked up this book because I wanted to see when is it suitable for my daughter to start reading this series and because of the high ratings, but it was such a disappointment. I think the author was trying to build up mysteries in the storyline and want to unravel the pieces for later but the way it was narrated was just kind of annoying. Like the characters that Percy encountered will lead up to a question and just walks away or disappear without finishing a sentence. I can see my kids enjoying this series when they come of age or if I'm 10-15 years younger, but I just dont think this is for me."
364,365,2,I didn’t really care to much for this book. This book is about a boy name Percy Jackson who is sent to this camp called camp half blood were people with powers are sent. During his adventure he fights creatures and gods. In one part of the book he fought medusa in a fast food restaurant. I didn’t like this book because I thought that him just fighting demons was that interesting and I would have preferred it if he had been fighting criminals. The part of the book that I found interesting was the beginning when he is at a field trip at a museum and he had gotten in trouble with his pre-algebra teacher named Mrs.Dotts and she disappeared and everyone told him that there was never a Mrs.Dotts.
365,366,2,"Why does this book have so high ratings?
I didn't really like this book that much... It felt like a bit too much of a roller-coaster which was also really predictable after like 2 incidents...
The trio ( which seems very similar to HP) keep meeting people who they think aren't monsters but are always monsters or gods.. There is no element of surprise after 2-3 such incidents..
The book seems like someone wanted to educate people about Greek mythology and wrote a story about it...
Even the prophecy unfolded in a very predictable way...
Even the writing was very informal and offhandish....

Maybe I read the book at the wrong age... It's meant for YA audience and I am in late 20s.. but I really didn't enjoy the book as much as reviews suggest..."
366,367,2,"Usually, when i give two stars i give two stars because it was a bad book but it had that one redeeming quality... With this one I'm pretty sure I've read it multiple times and i still don't know if i could tell you how it ends.
It's a children's book written for children probably for twelve year old's if we go by the age of the hero, so it's no shock that when i read this for the first time as an adult I was a little under whelmed.
As someone who isn't super into mythology I think this book just wasn't for me.
I don't think It was a bad book... I just don't think I'm the demographic they were shooting for... my bad.
But i will say, his love of all bright blue foods is one that is very relatable to me."
367,368,2,"Well, this was the biggest disappointment in a long while. So many people love it, so I had great expectations, and the book is well written and easy to read, but... I don't think I've ever come across such an idiotic protagonist before. All the plot twists could be guessed from ten miles off, and were foreshadowed constantly, making Percy and his friends seem profoundly stupid for not figuring a single one of them out. Plus there are hits like temporary fridging, the ever-lasting concern with ""Western civilization"" (and of course Olympus is in New York, God forbid anything at all important was ever outside the US) or the casual reminder that women in niqabs aren't to be trusted because there could be anything under there!"
368,369,2,"now i would say that if i was a kid i probably would have loved it, but that’s not true. I was never a percy jackson kid. i believe i read this book in fourth grade, but never made it to the second one. that being said, as an adult, turning world war ii into a fight between greek gods feels so antisemitic. the humor wasn’t for me. percy really doesn’t have any genuine reactions to any form of trauma. special snowflake shit. also — this western expansion imperialist bullshit was really icky to me. the american setting felt off (shout out to the stl arch i see every day on my commute) and the idea that the gods just came to america in cartoony stereotypical fashion was… sad. plot was repetitive."
369,370,2,"This book was okay. Nothing outstanding or terrible about it.
I thought that the way he reacted to his mother's supposed death at the beginning was weird. If he truly thought she had died, regardless of whether he got her back at the end, I would think he'd be a little more distraught.
I also wasn't a huge fan of the writing, it wasn't very engaging, and even my eleven-year-old brother, who I was reading this with, wasn't very impressed by it. We'll be reading the second book because we already rented it, but I don't think we'll be continuing after that one unless it ends up being a huge step-up from the first. Even as someone who adores middle-grade fantasy, I don't really understand this book's popularity."
370,371,2,"So. Much. Passive. Voice.

It's an obvious attempt to cash in on the Harry Potter franchise, but with a Greek god flavoring. Prepare for dozens of name-drops, because every member of the Parthenon *must* be mentioned. The story never really finds its heart, either due to the cast or the writing style of the author.

For a twelve year old boy, Percy is a bit too mature and too nonchalant about his lineage. The kid finds out he's the son of Poseidon and doesn't make any juvenile water pranks?

And why does everyone have the exact same personality in their dialogue. Zeus, Grover, Annabeth... None of them sound different from one another.

It's just ""meh"". Maybe I'm so unhappy with it because it could have been so much better."
371,372,2,"Okay... so I may be too old to appreciate this book properly.
usually I'm a fan of YA fiction because it doesn't have traumatic assault scenes and still usually has awesome plots and intriguing characters.

I didn't really feel that with this book. I felt that there wasn't much plot, and the author didn't trust me with complex ideas or difficult problems. Just straightforward action. It really felt like it was written for the big screen... but unfortunately they bungled that as well.
I first saw the movie... which was meh. Then everyone said the book was better, so I tried that... and meh.

If you like action, teens being teens, thin plots, and Greek mythology out of context, this is the book for you!"
372,373,2,"Don’t hate me…

I’m sure it is a much different experience if you read it when you were younger and are reading again for nostalgia. But reading for the first time at 32, I found it underwhelming. I chose it because I saw so many people recommend it if you loved Harry Potter (which I read at 30 and absolutely loved). It just doesn’t have the same feel as HP though. It reads much younger, even though he’s actually older than Harry. I liked the take on mythology, because I know very little about Greek mythology and this simplifies it to where I can understand it. Other than that though, I was bored pretty much the entire time and wanted to just hurry and get it over with. Haven’t decided whether I’ll continue the series or not. May just save it for when my child is old enough to enjoy it."
373,374,2,"I picked this up because my partner recommended it.

It is an epic tale, I must say, but the writing style is aimed towards children, and I can't get past that.

The bulk of the book was Percy and his friends getting themselves distracted on their quest and running into trouble. It felt like useless parts that didn't need to be included, because it didn't contribute to the main mission that they were on. Not only that, but it was all tell, and no show (which makes sense for a kid's book, but it wasn't particularly immersive).

Despite this, I'm going to read the second book because apparently it gets better. If the writing style doesn't improve, or if I don't see any merits to it, I wont be reading the third."
374,375,2,"Not my cup of tea. I do not like mythology or fantasy. I am also older than the intended audience. I can see why the tween group would like an adventure story with monster slaying in it, though.
Beyond that, the book is so flawed. I do not like how the evil characters are ugly and the good characters are physically attractive. I know some of this is from the Greek mythology stories. There is no reason this could not have been changed. Ares did not ride a motor cycle in Greek mythology.
I found the plotting and character development weak. There is great children's lit out there with excellent writing. Percy rarely had a plan. Things just happened and problems were resolved on the spot."
375,376,2,"The writting style wasn't the level that I'm used to and was very simplistic, almost as if meant for someone who doesn't know english so well of a young child. However the story line as great and a HUGE step up from the movie. I watched the movie first and then the book and I'm really mad at how they completely disregarded the entire book when making the movie. Right now I'm also reading the last book of the Harry Potter series and I must say I prefer them but I'm also more familiar now with the characters there and the world, so maybe I'll soon feel like the Percy Jackson world is also like a family to me as I go on in the series."
376,377,2,"I am kind of frustrated I feel this way about this book. I had a hard time finishing it. The fact that I saw the movie first plays a lot in the fact that I don't care as much as I would like about the first novel of the Percy Jackson series. Of course, I will give The Sea of Monsters a chance. Part of my enjoyment was ruined by the fact that I knew the ending to The Lightning Thief.

I don't think the story has a lot of depth. And I didn't like the characters nor their humour. This whole prophecy thing got me yawning.

I hope the second book gets me more excited about Percy's adventures, because I remember LOVING the movie."
377,378,2,"When I was in High School, I read this, thinking it will be a superpowered teen with Greek Mythology themes. It is exactly that, but I found some scenes uncomfortable. There is a part where the character is introduced to the camp of demi gods, and they are all children of various gods, and they're stereotyped that way. Needless to say, the evil gods were given evil/bully children and the nice gods had nice descendants. IDK why exactlythis made me stop the book, but maybe it was also the quality. I guess the fight scenes weren't that thrilling, either; just the typical fighter teenager set up, most of the book revolving around monsters that have little to no characterization."
378,379,2,"I am not blind - I can see that the average rating for this book is 4.23 stars, but here are the reasons why I thought The Lightning Thief was not that great. Number some, the reader needs a lot of background knowledge of the Greek Gods and Goddess, and there are so many mentioned, it was confusing to keep track. Number two, the fantasy of this novel just didn’t hit a higher note like Harry Potter or The Hunger Games did for me. Number three, it’s very unlikely Percy can find his way out of so many dire situations, and he does. That’s bogus! I admit, there were some clever scenarios, like the Lotus Hotel and the trip to Hades, but overall it left me wanting to read my next book."
379,380,2,
380,381,2,"2.5

I'm pretty sure I would have liked this book so much had I read it when I was around Percy's age but as an adult, I found it to be pretty ""meh."" This world isn't super interesting to me, the quest that took place in this book was also kind of medicore to read about. I don't want to blame it completely on the target age audience for this series (middle grade) as to be the reason why I was just ""okay"" about this first book because I am a huge fan of middle grade in general. Overall, I will continue on with this series because I heard it only gets better but I can't say I was blown away by this one."
381,382,2,"Elég halovány Potter-ripoff. A szereplők legtöbbször idegesítőek, a nyelvezet nekem nagyon-nagyon amerikai volt (ami persze érthető, csak nehezen szoktam meg). De a legnagyobb problémám az volt vele, hogy ez nem egy sztori volt. Csupán egymást követő random események, amire a szereplőknek minimális ráhatása volt. Mindez azért sajnálatos igazán, mert az írás maga élvezetes lenne, jó az író stílusa, csak az eredetiség teljes hiánya és a gyengén megalkotott szereplők rengeteget rontanak rajta. Feltett szándékom volt, hogy az egész sorozatot elolvassam. Egyelőre nem mondtam le róla, és nagyon remélem, hogy csak a kezdet volt ilyen döcögős."
382,383,2,"Started off moderately interesting but by page 41 I was over it. I can buy a lot of stuff in literature -- note that I love the Harry Potter series and the Lord of the Rings trilogy -- but Greek gods actually being real in our world? Absolutely not.

Bumps too clumsily against my notion that there's only one true God who created all things, who wasn't made in the image of man, but made man in his image. I don't see the point of gods who are essentially flawed humans with unlimited powers, who are capricious and selfish and live forever.

The illustrations in this edition are beautiful, by the way."
383,384,2,"I think that this book on it's own isn't the best because of it's simplicity but as the series go on it gets more intriguing. I think that you have to start reading this series before reading the ""Heroes of Olympus"" or even ""Magnus Chase"".

The fact Rick Riordan has wrote multiple series based on the different religions of the people. This book gently introduces the Greek gods to the reader (although I had to look up some of the words/gods). The characters are described quite deeply and there is some kind of romance going on. I really like the ending of the book because it leaves you wondering what will happen next which leads you on to the next book."
384,385,2,"Very cliche and seems ""heavily inspired"" by Harry Potter. The plot is pretty much the same as sorcerer's stone. Percy realizes he's special and has to go to a place to train. Sound familiar yet? He meets two also magical friends at the camp and is sent on a quest. He defeats a powerful being and gets a rival. He then heads home. Don't even get me started on the language and jokes. The narration was a lame attempt to make the main character look witty, but just make him look annoying. The only reason I'm giving this a two star is because I liked the unique twist between the modern world and Greek mythology."
385,386,2,"Let me preface this by saying:

1.) I’m in a book club at the high school where I work, and the kids chose this as our first read this year; and 2.) I never read this book/ series as a kid. It was written when I was in middle school, so it hadn’t gained popularity yet.

With that being said, I will not read this book again!

I didn’t find the characters likable; the writing was formulated; the “plot” twists were predictable; and the scenarios were just unrealistic. Everything read immaturely, and I struggled to read most chapters.

To a middle-schooler this is probably a quick, fun read. To an adult, it was disappointing."
386,387,2,"This book is about about a boy named Percy who finds his place through a magical camp. This camp is called camp halfblood and it's for demigods. He starts an adventure to stop a war between gods. Much of his problems come from being a part of the big three which include Hades, Zeus, and Poseidon. I never was a fan of this book so I decided to reread it to see why. The book was written on a low level of reading. It wasn't a very creative or entertaining story either. Unless you are into Greek mythology or like children's fantasy books this probably won't draw much interest. I give this a 2/5 stars."
387,388,2,"Aún no decido si darle 3 estrellas o 2 estrellas, los primeros capítulos son tan aburridos nada pasa y se vuelven muy tediosos, esta muy bien escrito, eso es verdad, pero no sé no fue para mi.

No creo que el problema sea que es para niños, si no la falta de creatividad para escribir los primeros capítulos. Después hace una mejora a mi gusto pero no significativa.

No tengo personaje favorito, también dicta mucho eso de mi calificación, pero ya compre los libros, así que leeré el libro 2 a ver si esto mejora.

A todos les encanta Percy que siento que leí un libro totalmente diferente al que describen en reseñas."
388,389,2,"Ok objectively I think this is a strong kids book. Subjectively I just didn’t like it very much. Very pilgrims progress with crazy event after crazy event that didn’t actually do anything to move the plot forward. A lot of equating the evil characters with ugliness or fatness. And something about the sanitization of all the raping the Greek gods did for the purpose of this story was just really weird to me - every time they referred to “your mom��� or “your dad” it was jarring. I also was not surprised by what happened and how things ended at really any point, which was kind of a bummer. Glad to get it off my tbr but don’t plan to continue the series."
389,390,2,"I loved Harry Potter, Ender's Game, Hunger Games, etc for young adults. The general theme was interesting and surrounds a lot of Greek mythology but knowing a fair amount, you knew exactly what was around every corner when the protagonist encountered them. I also had the audiobook and I wanted to puke. The individual reading had the most cliche voices and was pretty one dimensional. Give me something that isn't focused around such juvenile thought processes and obstacles that one can't foresee outcomes pages ahead.

Not very impressed."
390,391,2,"I’ve made more than one attempt to get through this book, since the series is so popular with young people, but I always bomb out about half way through. It’s not just that the characters are boring; the plot suffers, too. It’s sort of a Harry Potter rip-off, substituting mythology for wizardry. A kid has special powers he’s barely aware of, he’s whisked off to a special school where he meets others like himself. . . so what’s new here? I realize that juvenile fiction doesn’t have to be great literature, but the best kids’ books are great reading for adults, too. This one isn’t."
391,392,2,"""Should I read these books?""

In my opinion, yes, but know that the writing in the first book is very bad - Mr Riordan was not a writer and learned the craft as he went on.

But he really loves mythology and always escapes from old lazy stereotypes in greek mythology that a hack hollywood screen writer would use- he really knows his stuff, and that makes the story engaging, as the chracters start to grow on you.

Not a huge start, but if you stick to the road it gets better. If you would rather jumpt to a good start, his second series on the Olympians is a lot better."
392,393,2,"I got some serious HP feels, what with Percy being the chosen one, the Trio with the smart girl best friend, the hero's self-doubts, one archenemy acting through others and regaining power. I have to admit it was a letdown. Nevertheless, I would like to see whether it gets better in the next books and proves to be different.

P.S- There was even a reference made to Harry Potter in the book. And the first Percy Jackson movie is directed by Chris Columbus (Yes, the same director who gave us the first HP movie)"
393,394,2,"Child literature not entertaining for a 34 year-old male adult.

I read the first book in a single day without trouble, the book is easy to comprehend and easy to read, the pages flow in the reader's hand.

However, I did not like the conflict resolution, nor the characters and their personalities, nor the constant links with United Stated geographic locations and pop culture.

I read this book after finishing ""The Wheel of Time"" from Robert Jordan, and they are worlds apart.

As a side note, I read Harry Potter and I never felt disappointed by the series."
394,395,2,
395,396,2,"This is the most disappointed I've been while reading a book in a while. It started off really bad and got mildly better through the middle and end, but was never in any way good.

As a fan of Greco-Roman mythology, I was hoping for much more than goofy conversion characters and plots that made no sense, especially scene to scene.

It really surprises me that this book is as popular and highly rated as it is. I am curious if it gets better and ages with the reader, but not sure if I am intrigued enough to try any more books in this series."
396,397,2,"A mi hijo le encantan las sagas de Rick Riordan. Por eso leí el primer libro de la primera saga. Y además después de ver la película... Entretenido, con ritmo desde el principio, con alguna introducción a la mitología griega que puede ser interesante desde un punto de vista educativo, didáctico. Pero vaya, para adolescentes. Personajes planos, situaciones predecibles, lenguaje sencillo. Quizás sea muy apropiado para lectores noveles o sencillamente entretenido para jóvenes con ganas de aventuras."
397,398,2,"(Unpopular Opinion . . . Obviously)
I give Riordan props for his original idea but man how it went south from there. Shallow characters, shallow plot, shallow dialogue, and shallow story. One of my biggest complaints is that Riordan ALWAYS made the scenes feel unreal and low stakes by filling them with goofy monsters and cheesy dialogue. The Greek God aspect / Camp Half-Blood is great, but EVERYTHING else was simply bad. I made it through the first four books, opened up the first chapter of book five and couldn't bring myself to finish it."
398,399,2,"I dont dislike this book, nor I freaking love it. I actually has few issues with it. The knowledge of the Greek myth is so general and there is no exploration to its historical aspect. If you new to greek mythology, then it's probably good for you for a introduction. But it's not really deep enough. The plot is kinda shallow, and the author thinks what makes it interesting is the greek myth and creatures involved in these children adventure. Conclusion: this is not for me. I love greek myth but not to be story told this way. This is wayy too for children."
399,400,2,"Good story, but felt rushed

As a casual fan of Greek mythology, the plot and the subject matter were very intriguing, but the first installment in this series definitely read like a middle school teacher’s first book to me. The book is already almost 400 pages long, but there were several chapters that could have benefited from more detailed scenes, especially the action scenes. That being said, I do look forward to continuing with Percy Jackson’s journey and will be reading the rest of the series."
400,401,2,"I feel like my rating is almost unfair...almost.

I've read some of the spin off series, and that was the biggest downfall of this book. This book isn't exactly bad, but compared to the later series... It's ROUGH, to say the least.

The pacing is all wacky, and it takes awhile for it to get interesting. Percy is irritating and kinda stupid. The narration is trying, but failing, at being funny and witty. And all of that is such a disappointment because literally none of these issues happen in the later books that I've read."
401,402,2,"Look the blending of the modern age with the stories of the Olympians is interesting but this book is filled with patriarchal/boys-ultimately-save-girls, and ableist vibes that leaves this book with a terrible aftertaste. For me, even worse than the sexist sentiments, are the normalizing of abusive and neglectful relationships. Granted, the story of the Olympians are about extremely neglectful parents, but Riordan paints a world where children just accept that abusive neglectful relationships are a norm."
402,403,2,"2,5☆
Desde que me interessei em livros, Percy jackson era exatamente o livro que eu queria ler, o protagonista era jovem, tinha elementos mágicos e mitologia grega que eu sempre fui apaixonada. O tempo veio e foi, eu cresci e por motivos que não sei explicar acabei por não ler, minha vontade e expectativas desapareceram e foi quando eu finalmente decidi lê-lo. E foi uma experiência bem morna, não me apaixonei por nada  e nem ninguém (exceto o próprio Percy que é um amor)ao mesmo tempo que não odiei nada na mesma proporção, em fim, não vejo o porque de continuar com a saga (quem sabe um dia)"
403,404,2,"So i read this book a while back and i’m going to be completely honest, i wanted to like this book so so bad especially because my friend was talking to well of it so i really wished to like it but i honestly didn’t. Like nothing in it makes any sense? minotaurs, centaurs and what else… it’s not realistic like hades really?? these people don’t exist in real life so i couldn’t possibly give this book more than 2 stars. and the reason i gave it 2 anyway is because Percy was a bearable character, i will however not be reading the second book."
404,405,2,"Ultimately, The Lightning Thief just isn't for me. I regret my early comments by which I implied, or perhaps directly said, that only an ignorant, ill-informed child would enjoy the book. I understand how someone would find the book enjoyable. If that's you, that's great. Honestly. There is no canon of books that must be read. Reading should be a delight, not a duty. Don't let me yuck your yum.

If your reading tastes happen to hew close to mine, then I suspect you likely won't enjoy . Otherwise, if the book strikes your fancy, go for it."
405,406,2,"I didn't realise how important to me a decent female protagonist is - Annabeth was hard to connect to and there were few other kickass female characters. Also I like learning about how a hero works for their skills, Percy automatically was good at certain things without really having to learn. Overall an engaging read but a bit low on the character development to grab me/a bit fast paced jumping from one monster to another with not much in between. But good to mindlessly have downtime... Don't think I'll bother with the rest of the series."
406,407,2,As a teacher I get exposed to quite a few popular children’s books. I’ve always heard that these books were a “new perspective” on the Greek Pantheon. God of War II is a better “new perspective” on Greek Mythology because it adds a new characters that actually acts in a way that expands on our understanding of these ancient characters and how they would act. The lightning thief rides on the coattails of coattails left behind by Harry Potter copycats. Terrible character motivations hidden behind a veil of teenage angst. Would not recommend.
407,408,2,"I absolutely despise leaving books unfinished. Usually I battle through them no matter how unpleasant it is. I almost dropped this book midway through. Almost.

So, it took me almost a year to read this, and it certainly wasn’t because of the language. The lightning thief just wasn’t my piece of cake. I gave it two stars because it did make me laugh and smile, and I definitely have read worse books.

Though, I’m not really this book’s target audience. If I would’ve gotten my hands on this series as a child, I’m certain I would’ve devoured it."

I think a big part of it is where I am in my life, if I was in middle school I would have appreciated this book more. I didn't really feel for any of the characters and none of it really drew me in. The humor wasn't funny to me, and overall I just wasn't looking forward to finishing it. Oh well~"
411,412,2,"This series & author had been recommended to me plenty of times, so I finally checked it out. I was entertained by this book and can see why it's very popular. I have always loved Greek mythology so this was an interesting take on it. The book didn't capture me hook, line & sinker though so I don't think I'll continue this series right now. There's a definite possibility that I find myself thinking about the series down the road though and if that happens I'll pick up the next in the series."
412,413,2,"I feel like if I was younger I could have enjoyed it. But the plot moves around too quickly for me, too many things simply fall in to place to work and the writing... perhaps if the series was presented as a show/cartoon I would enjoy it, but as a book the writing is simple and bland. All of this combined with the fact that it relies on Greek Mythology to build a world instead of building it itself, leads to a disappointing book."
413,414,2,"I️ have mixed feelings about this book. I️ liked the characters, and I️ liked some of the adventures the three main characters embark on, but still it does not convince me. I️ think it is a read for kids, adults may not enjoy it as much. I️ went into this book thinking that I️ would have a similar experience as I️ had with Harry Potter, but not even close. It was a light read, what I️ needed in the moment, but I️ would not be reading the rest of the books in the series."
414,415,2,"This book was way too rushed. You're immediately thrown into this new world because the author can't wait to tell that story and thus you don't get enough back story to care about the characters. Then it's one problem after the next hurriedly thrown at the main character (Percy) until the end of the book, where they sneak in one last one because Rick can. This was not a smooth story and sad to see a unique concept like half-bloods be ruined by poor story-telling."
415,416,2,"Read this for the first time as a kid and didn’t like it, and I still do not like it as an adult All interesting adventure concepts are ruined by a baffling writing concept of “one adventure per chapter,” making a rushed, confused mess of a plot that goes nowhere besides a legitimately decent twist. There’s a good book hidden somewhere in here, and it steals just the right amount from Harry Potter to make it interesting enough to get through."
416,417,2,"Maybe I had heard too much good about this book and expected too much?
It did seem a lot like Harry Potter - lightning bolts, discovering powers, summer camp vs boarding school training, trio of hero, clever girl, and funny boy (although in different ways), Hagrid vs centaur. Most of the fight scenes were basically the troll scene from Harry Potter.
Like a loud american cousin to Harry Potter, but I didn't care for the hero half as much.
Two stars - it was okay."
417,418,2,"Et stærkt præmis, mange gode idéer og et frisk take på myterne... kunne ikke forhindre denne her bog i at være forfærdeligt underskrevet, ikke have nogen forståelse for dramaturgi eller opbyggelsen af spænding, samt et persongalleri, der var så kliché, at det til tider var helt pinligt at læse. At denne bog er beregnet til børn og unge teenagere er ingen undskyldning for dens svagheder, og det er en skam, for det ER et godt præmis."
418,419,2,"2 stars. Well, this was disappointing. Usually, I like ""the Chosen One"" type stories...but I don't know why Percy was even chosen. I've heard good things about this series. I guess I've read this plot pattern too many times, I might've enjoyed this 3 years ago. But it also felt a little pointless and hopeless, even accidental. Like the plot was just floundering around with no real moral purpose. I don't really want to read a series with a bunch of gods tossing around powers and the characters."
419,420,2,"My daughter loves these and is reading the series to me. I have nothing but great things to say about Rick Riordan as a person and how he's handled his literary clout to bring much needed diversity into his later series and especially for creating an imprint for more diverse voices in YA Fantasy. That being said, this is a sort of paint by numbers tale in the Harry Potter mold. Apparently his later series are better in their creativity."
420,421,2,"Unpopular opinion time
This story did next to nothing for me, I didn't like anyone (apart from hades), I didn't like the world or how the gods fitted into it. I feel the modern edge just ruined the wonder and greatness of Greek mythology.
Bad puns and cheesy one-liners made it worse. Plot twist was dull.
I struggled to get through it or even enjoy it.
Camp half-blood is not for me.
2 stars for hades and thalia though."
421,422,2,"It was okay. The writing wasn't great. The plot was predictable and, at times, very boring and/or embarrassing. There were not many good lessons in it to make up for some of the bad ones.

It was definitely creative, though. Had it been written better, it would have been a fun read. As it stands, I don't know if it's because I'm too old for it, but I doubt I'll ever care enough to read further into the series and wouldn't recommend it to others."
422,423,2,"The whole series is a little too childish for me (i am 25 yrs old) Most of the main characters are teenagers and they do think and act like one. Despite the fact that they keep making childish decisions and actions they end up saving the world again and again and it makes the story a little weak for me. I read this after I have finished Way of kings, mistborn and kingkiller chronicles and to be honest this one let me down a little bit despite it's super high rating."
423,424,2,"The reason I don’t LOVE this book is probably because I haven’t finished the series yet, and I also didn’t read it when I was young like most fans of it did. I liked the characters and the world, but I didn’t really love the way the plot moved forward. It felt like a bunch of random scenes squished together rather than a natural succession. I know that this series is really popular so I’m still continuing reading it. I have a feeling that I will appreciate this book more once I’m done."
424,425,2,
425,426,2,"It wasn't that interesting, this is the second time I read it and it was just as bad. I read it all in one day so my girlfriend would read the book I wanted her to read (It's sort of a game of who will win reading the book they don't want to.) I will be reading the next book out of guilt because I feel I didn't give it a fair chance. But I really didn't like it. Rick Riordan's writing was good, this just isn't my cup of tea."
426,427,2,"I have an unpopular opinion, but I personally liked the movie better than the book. Percy Jackson was never a series that intrigued me. This book does have a lot of great imagination and I think if I was younger I would have enjoyed it more. This would be a good book to recommend to a student who might be interested in greek gods or goddesses. That has never been an area that has been super interesting to me, which is probably why I didn't love the book. I do think this is a good book to recommend to students, it just wasn't for me."
427,428,2,
428,429,2,"I don't think I'm the target audience of this book. Percy acts alternatively like an adult or a petulant kid, at the convenience of the author. There is a fun bestiary and cast of characters, but it feels like a lesser version of Good Omens, American Gods, Small Gods, etc. There are moments that might be suspenseful if you don't know the underlying cast, like the appearance of Medusa, but they were all telegraphed enough to be predictable."
429,430,2,"I read this novel a long time ago and remember that even as a child I found it quite childish! The plot was not that interesting, the mythological references are certainly appreciable but also the only reason why I'm giving this book a few stars.
I don't think I'll continue reading this saga, I found very little character development and a repetitive modus operandi in the plot.
Maybe I'll give it a second chance in the future but not now..."
430,431,2,I wish had read this book as a kid. I wish I would have liked this book a lot more. I couldn't get past the writing style. I have a degree in history and greek anything has always been a chore to me... Should have expected that going into this book :( Sad that I didn't enjoy it like others... The betrayal at the end was good though... Even if I did spot it a third of the way into the book. Too predictable. But I will totally recommend it to the kiddos in my family.
431,432,2,Too many story similarities to Harry Potter to believe the author wasn’t trying to recreate it. It was like he took the story formula and plot points and attempted to put it into a Greek mythology hybrid. It was only ok. The characters were poorly developed and uninteresting and I just kept thinking that the author missed so many opportunities to make this great. Will read the second one and hope for better.
432,433,2,"I’m gonna be perfectly honest here, I am altogether unimpressed with this series as a whole. Don’t get me wrong, the idea is great, and the portrayal of the Greek gods in modern times is fun, but the book itself is not that great. The descriptions are confusing and awkward, the story itself is strange, and the characters are underdeveloped and rather hard to like sometimes. These books are fun to read for the first time in middle school, but that’s it."
433,434,2,
434,435,2,"For being a kids book the author describes very well without the reader being overwhelmed, it was an enjoyable story. Since I watched the movie I always wanted to read the books and now that I had the opportunity I’m disappointed that they left out a lot of scenes in the movie and changed almost all the story, nevertheless, it’s still a good movie and so is the book.

bookstagram: moneyforbooks45"
435,436,2,"I have finished with all the books in this series a long time ago and they are great but the thing is… well personally I like stories with less main characters, so even after reading all the books the story stays with you forever… but in this series there are just wayyy too many charactets so I only remember 30% of the books now… while u are reading them the storyline and adventures are great and keep you hooked but once u finish not much of it stays with you."
436,437,2,"It was an okay read, but ""meh"". Fantasy is one of my favorite genre, and I've read better books.
Hadn't read the series, though many had recommended that I do. Then my better half & I watched the movie.
After that, I read the book. Call it temptation to see what it was like. To put it simply, I liked the movie better.
Not likely I will read the series further, but I have watched the second movie, so might be ""tempted"". Who knows?"
437,438,2,"I'm all for reading middle-grade books as an adult, but this was NOT my jam. My biggest problem is that I don't like Percy. He is that annoying self-insert character in fics that I always hate. This makes me be overly critical to all other aspects of the book. I can see this book being fun to read as a kid - preferably a boy age 12-14 - and I guess it's a fun way to get acquainted with Greek mythology."
438,439,2,"This felt like a Harry Potter knock-off right from the start. I read maybe 120 pages and then flipped to the last 50. Nothing original here. This is YA, so I will say that I can see myself liking this a lot if I was in my early teens, but it doesn't do much for me now. It kind of felt like some teacher was trying to make the study of Greek mythology interesting to his class of 6th graders. It didn't work..."
439,440,2,"I guess this would’ve been better if I were in 5th grade. It’s the book that my high schoolers most often cite as the last book they enjoyed. I finally took the plunge, expecting a children’s book with some craft going for it. And it does have some, but every variable is plucked from Harry Potter and replaced with Greek mythology. Now, my students are saying the first one is the worst, and I gotta keep going, BUT I REFUSE!"
440,441,2,"I guess it's cool that kids get to engage with myths through this. As for my experience reading this: I really don't like going from action scene to action scene. Give me something to have thoughts about. Not a lot, but just something! I usually love training montages (in whatever medium), but this one was completely forgettable. Whenever I feel like the writer wrote a book just to pray that it will be made into a movie one day, I'm out. This was such a book."
441,442,2,I guess I'm too old for this series (33yo). I found Percy to be an obnoxious character and the story too predictable. I prefer books that have endearing characters so that I feel invested in whether the characters succeed. This was not one of those books. I'm sure that young readers and those young at heart will find this to be a delightful read. But I'll stick with Harry Potter and Tiffany Aching (by Terry Pratchett) when I feel like reading about young characters.
442,443,2,"I am way too old to be reading this book. I thought maybe it'd be like Harry Potter and I could ignore the fact the characters are kids. I couldn't.

The book was fine. It annoyed me how formulaic it was in the middle third. Go somewhere, find something out of the ordinary, get caught in a trap, have to escape. Ad infinitum.

I think I'll wait until I have kids of my own that I can read these books to rather than carry on myself."
443,444,2,"I think if I read this as a kid, I would've really enjoyed it. It was fun spotting the references to Greek mythology. The plot was kind of predictable and the character building was ok. I would like to learn more about Annabeth. I know Percy is the ""hero"" but it was unbelievable that
he was able to defeat Ares so easily. Also, Hades and the rest of the gods were so easily deceived."
444,445,2,"Poor man's American Harry Potter? I mean, was it necessary to actually make him a scrawny 12 yr old with black hair and green eyes? Also I realize I'm a grown adult reading a children's book, but WHERE are the adults here? Sending three CHILDREN off to travel across the US on their own, knowing they're being hunted by monsters? Not even remotely understandable logic. At least Dumbledore waited until Harry's 6th year before actively sending him off into danger."
445,446,2,This book… I’m not a fan of Greek mythology and I never will be it took me so long to pick up and read I didn’t even finish it. My friend has been recommending it to me for years so I bought it on a wimp. The idea of the story was good the writing was good too. I want to watch the movies even though lots of people say they are bad. I might come back to this book I might not we will have to wait and see but for now Percy Jackson is not for me.

Książka w porządku, ale żadnego zachwytu nie było. Prawdopodobnie gdybym przeczytała ją kilka lat wcześniej, to bardziej by mi się spodobała. Na pewno jest to dobra propozycja dla młodszych czytelników. Fabuła dość ciekawa, akcja też utrzymana w szybkim tempie, ale moim zdaniem nie umywa się to do serii o Harrym Potterze, do której często ta książka jest porównywana.
Myślę, że może jeszcze kiedyś sięgnę po kolejne części, gdy będę mieć ochotę na coś lekkiego i szybkiego w czytaniu."
447,448,2,"2.5 ⭐

Partiamo col dire che l'originalità dell'autore è tantissima e questa glielo riconosco. Mi dispiace perché questo libro per l'idea poteva essere molto di più ma la scrittura è molto povera e banale. Certe volte ci sono delle rotture della quarta parete un po' inopportune e l'incipit anche se sicuramente ha lo scopo di farti immedesimare non lo fa e peggiora il tutto. Non credo che questo libro meriti tutta la fama che ha e non so se leggerò gli altri libri della saga."
448,449,2,"Was excited to read this as I have always loved the movies but, as usual, it appears Hollywood took many liberties so there are very few similarities. Not surprised but this but I didn't realize how juvenile the book really was. The fact that the kids are so young really turned me off. I much prefer how they are portrayed in the films, though I suppose had I been a fan of the books as a kid I might feel the opposite. Oh well, now I know."
449,450,2,"I have absolutely no idea what all the hype is about. I was told this series is on par with Harry Potter...definitely not. The dialog is cringey, the characters are quite flat and contradictory at times, and the way they explain magic throughout the book is just awkward. I prefer the movie much more --- the gimmicky storyline involving 'modern' versions of Greek characters/places had a more intentional delivery on screen than on the page. Plus, you get to look at Logan Lerman for two hours."
450,451,2,"""The Lightning Thief"" is the thrilling first book in Rick Riordan's ""Percy Jackson & the Olympians"" series. Join Percy Jackson, a demigod with a witty sense of humor, as he embarks on an epic quest to prevent a war among the gods. With action-packed adventures, Greek mythology, and a relatable hero, this book is a must-read for fans of fantasy and adventure. Get ready to be hooked from the very first page! ⚡🌩️📚"
451,452,2,"2.5
""The Lightning Thief"" would have been great when I was ten or so. Unfortunately, I am no longer ten, so I have aged out of a lot of the themes and jokes. I also have a good knowledge of Greek and Roman mythology, so the events were not often a surprise.
This would probably be a good book for late elementary school kids to middle teens, but it was a bit juvenile for me personally"
452,453,2,"Meh. Very cringey Harry Potter rip-off which requires A LOT of suspended disbelief on account of the reader. I might have been ok with the protagonist walking into one obvious trap, but the whole book is basically this on repeat. Ugh! Pretty maddening to be honest. It does have it's charm, but all in all it just feels like really lazy writing."
453,454,2,"It is either the fact that I read a bunch of Brandon Sanderson books around the same time as I was reading The Lightning Thief or I am just getting too old for the ""Young Adult"" genre in general (although I am still clinging to Harry Potter!). But I did not really enjoy reading this book. The story and characters felt much too shallow for my taste, so I will not pick up the sequels."
454,455,2,"2.5 stars. I love the Greek-myths-meet-Harry-Potter aspect, but there are a lot of annoying things that as an adult I find distracting. The emphasis on Grover eating like a goat. The out of place tween jokes. The quickness of the events. The weirdness of the normality of camp life (we had s'mores around the campfire""). Etc. The narrator wasn't my favorite, either. My five year old loved it."
455,456,2,"I was hot and cold with this book. Parts of it were very clever and unique. But the monster aspect grew monotonous and boring. I knew this book was fantasy. I knew it would be unbelievable. But that didn't deter me. Unfortunately, it was too over-the-top. This was too much for a sixth grader to undertake, over and over. I won't continue on with this predictable series."
456,457,2,"Wow, I wanted good things but was I wrong. This was a “paint by number” mythology. Go down the list and check off the known monsters and archetypes. If you want to read about humans and Gods, read Gaiman, Green and or Hearne. Leave this tripe for little kids who have no concept of plot, foreshadowing or subtlety."
457,458,2,"Not really sure what I was expecting when I picked this one up. Always on the lookout for the next Harry Potter, I had heard and read a great deal about this series and thought of giving it a try. Very disappointed at the end. Immature and kiddish writing all through and the characters have no depth whatsoever. Cannot hold a candle to potter."
458,459,2,"Don't read this as an adult. I was expecting a well-crafted JK Rowling-level story aimed at children and instead what I got was a disappointing 2-bit blatant Harry Potter knock-off that reads like it was written by a 5th grader. Maybe I would have liked it better as a kid, but it still stole 70% of the material from the Harry Potter books and that's just not cool."
459,460,2,This would be so much better if the adults weren't so mean. Literally every adult is a dick except Percy's mom & she's not great either. I've been listening to a lot of YA fantasy lately & this is missing something. The dialog never really seems believable. But the Greek myth nerd in me was pleased with all the connections.
460,461,2,"Sometimes these middle grade books can grab you with cool adventures and clever twists, but this wasn't one of them. It's certainly no Harry Potter, but having just recently read City of Ghosts, it just didn't measure up."
461,462,2,"Good premise but I found it hard to read due to the very poor writing. It felt like it was written by a 12 year old, not for a 12 year old. I recognize that it is a kid's book but that doesn't mean it should be clunky. Fortunately, I'm very easily entertained so I didn't hate it. I'm also glad the movie increased Percy's age. Percy needed some more maturing."
462,463,2,i kinda liked this book. the characters were well and i felt like i knew them. i don’t think i want to watch the movies because everyone says how shit they are! this book is a bit too childish for me (i’m 17) and i don’t think i want to read the other ones. it was really predictable and i hate books like that. :/
463,464,2,"This book was a lot of fun, and I loved the tone of it, but because it's aimed for younger audiences it just didn't really click for me. It is also, unfortunately, one of those books that assumes you know the geography of America. A redeeming quality: Sally Jackson killing her abuser and selling his body for money. Truly iconic of her.

2 hero quests out of 5"
464,465,2,"Yeah, this book was not my cup of tea. I don’t blame the author tho, because this type of genre is not for me.

I wanted to read something out of my comfort zone and it did not end up so well.

The writing was easy and straightforward. I always wondered about the history of the greek gods and this book gave me a fascinated brief about it!"
465,466,2,"A weak start, poorly written characters, lack of detail when it comes to descriptions and it doesn’t use it’s greek strengths until the end. While it is quite flawed The Lighting Thief is a enjoyable easy read and while it starts off weak it does get stronger especially towards the end. It works as a great buffer between more serious reads."
466,467,2,"Read for #romanceopoly 2020 Journey's End and #makeyourmythtake 2020 Witch Path :Magical Battle prompt

After hearing all the praise I honestly thought I would like it better. It was just ok. I've read better middle grade and better YA. Maybe it's just a product of it's time for it's genre that makes it so hyped up.

FWIW: Harry Potter is way better in this non potterhead's opinion."
467,468,2,"I think I read this way too late in my life and so I couldn't get past the simple writing style, the plot just felt predictable to me, and I didn't connect with any of the characters. I also don't like mythology so I didn't enjoy that aspect. Maybe if I read this in middle school, I would have really enjoyed it. Will not read the rest of the series."
468,469,2,"Sprunghafte Erzählweise, kaum Details, kurze Kapitel. Heute in New York und 10 Zeilen später per Bus ganz wo anders. Inhalte sind so grob beschrieben, dass man mehr von den Filmen vermittelt bekommt - und dies bei 5 Bänden. Das sollte anders herum sein, auch bei Jugendbüchern. 2 Sterne weil es die griechische Mythologie anschneidet. Aus sich eines Kindes unter 12 sicherlich 5 Sterne."
469,470,2,"'Luźna' książka o przyjaźni, ciekawy pomysł na fabułę. Niestety pewne problemy rozwi��zywane są przez bohaterów zadziwiająco łatwo i płynnie. Na każdym etapie swojej podróży napotykają na przeszkody, co w pewnym momencie uczyniło z każdego kolejnego rozdziału walkę z przeciwnikiem; było to dość męczące. Dodatkowo książka jest bardzo przewidywalna."
470,471,2,"I really thought this would be better! Not terrible, for a children’s book. I did NOT like how much ADHD was glamorised as a super power. And the plot seemed a little implausible. I suppose for a kids book... it was younger than I was expecting. And darker! Very little emotion but lots of abandonment. Meh, could have been better."
471,472,2,"A felénél vettem észre (ill. mondta is @noncsemma), hogy ez egy tinikönyv, így már értettem, hogy miért van ennyire lebutítva ez-az (pl. karakterfejlődés) benne. A sztori közepes, nem igazán élveztem, egyszálas, lineáris szájbarágás. Értem, hogy nem én vagy a célcsoport 33 évesen, de ha már végigolvastam, kénytelen vagyok jelen helyzetemből értékelni."
472,473,2,"Percy Jackson is the literary equivalent of rock music in the soundtrack of a period piece movie. It does not hold up to adults, and if you disliked the movie, the book isn't much better. That said, Rick Jordan is a very skilled writer, and it shows. This book wasn't for me, but I could have loved it had I read it as a child."
473,474,2,"A quick easy read. I feel that it was more geared for younger readers as the writing style was pretty simplistic and some big reveals were clear beforehand.

Although this may seem like a negative review, I would definitely recommend it for readers new to Greek myths. It's definitely a literary world away from the Odyssey though!"
474,475,2,"Entiendo que es un libro infantil, peor me ha parecido demasiado episódico. Aunque es muy interesante el tratamiento y uso de la mitología no es suficiente para mantener el interés. Me parece que la trama tiene agujeros grandes y los personajes son demasiado arquetípicos (cuando leía sobre le trío protagonista no podía evitar imaginarme a Harry, Ron y Hermione)."
475,476,2,"It was alright, but the information is very unrelated to Greek mythology. I think if you’re younger or prefer easier reading material you might like this, but as someone who read it in the seventh grade, I found it very easy and often annoying to read. I think if it was written in a different writing style I would have liked it, but I just can’t stand the way Riordan writes."
476,477,2,"I'm really late to the party with this one, and I'm no longer in middle school, which I think is sort of the target age demographic for this book, but yeah it was okay. Honestly I really hated the talkative narration thing that Percy had going on, but the world concept was fun and I'm still going to try and read the rest of the books in the series."
477,478,2,"Maybe I'd love this book if I read it as a kid, but as an adult this mostly felt like Rick Riordan took every random idea that popped into his head and strung them together into a series of plot contrivances for his uninteresting characters to stumble through. It's fun enough, but it mostly made me wish I was reading more Madeline Miller."
478,479,2,"I didn’t really like this book until the third act. It took me much longer than I would’ve liked to finish this just because of how boring I found it.

However the last bit I found really exciting and I’m definitely going to check out the sequel now that the world building is done for the most part"
479,480,2,"Percy learns that his father is Posideon, the god of Greek legend. He goes to a camp with other half-gods and makes friends along the way. After being accused of stealing Zeus's lightning bolt, Percy is sent on an adventure to prove himself innocent.

I did not like this book or this series. Every chapter heading tells you the most exciting thing that will happen in the chapter before you have read it, taking away all of the suspense. All of the characters are written as condescendingly daft, and the book feels like it was written by a dyslexic teen. Riordan can do better.

Warning: I don't recommend this book with all of the better young adult fantasy books to read."
480,481,2,"Me gustaban mucho en mis años mozos, pero ahora le veo muchas lagunas al concepto. Me parece un poco propaganda imperialista el hecho de que los dioses escojan USA, por tener este la hegemonía sobre el resto de países. En fin, que se me hace un análisis bastante pobre.
Por lo demás, es un libro correcto para niños y preadolescentes."
481,482,2,"I remember wanting to read this when I was younger (I have no idea why I never did), but as a greek mythology lover I found this… lacking and rather disappointing. The story is interesting, for sure; but the characters were very two dimensional imo and the greek mythology portions are just skimmed through. Won’t be continuing with the series/ would rather re-read the Odyssey."
482,483,2,"series q no voy a seguir y por que

influida x la popularidad del libro (y por haberlo leido traducido) siento q es medio una cagadita.

es medio boludo, en partes me aburrió y en partes pensé qué es lo q tenia de interesante y particular esta historia y no se me ocurrió nada. será tmb que no me interesa particularmente la mitologia griega entonces ://"
483,484,2,This book was very disappointing. I expected more from it. It made me upset and it totally felt like the plot was stolen from Harry potter. It was like Harry Potter mixed with mythology made cringy. Sadıy. 2 stars only because it was not good. The only good character was Annabeth. Overall this book was not good and I don't reccomend it
484,485,2,"This isn’t the worst thing I have ever read and I can see why kids enjoy it, but I’m definitely not the target audience, and I was expecting that, but I was hoping it would be like an early Harry Potter book or a Disney movie where it’s technically for kids but it’s purposely made so any age can enjoy it. It is not like that. It’s very clearly just for kids"
485,486,2,idk. I just had such high hopes for this book since I liked the movie and literally EVERYONE said this book was so good. but you can just tell it was written for kids. the problems they faced for solved so easily and they jumped from place to place it felt like. I ended up skimming the last 20 pages cause it just would not end :/
486,487,2,"2.5
I’m sad I didn’t love this as much as I wanted to or thought I would. It just didn’t fully click with me. I probably would have enjoyed it a little more if I had read it for the first time as a child.
I will be continuing the series, because I want to see where it goes from here, how the characters develop, etc."
487,488,2,"le doy dos estrellas ahora, porque en su momento ya lo leí y me ha aburrido un poco repetir la historia, no me ha emocionado nada, me da pena en verdad, no quiero ser mayor :( Pero bueno, a ver si sigo con los demás libros, porque siento curiosidad por cómo crecen los personajes y hay que ponerse al día para la nueva serie que espero que sea muy buena."
488,489,2,"The story follows the adventures of Percy Jackson, a twelve-year-old boy who discovers that he is a demigod the son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea. When Percy's mother is kidnapped by the vengeful god Zeus, he embarks on a dangerous quest to retrieve a stolen lightning bolt that Zeus believes Poseidon has stolen."
489,490,2,"I can see how fantasy-hungry kids during Harry Potter's hype era would gravitate towards this book, and I could've been one of those kids, but I wasn't. Reading it as an adult felt a mix of cringe towards the ""childish humor"" and confusion towards the many references to Greek mythology. And perhaps this is my adult mind, but I would have been even more confused as a teen/tween than I was now."
490,491,2,"I fully recognize that this was written close to 20 years ago and I am a 32 year old lady. This was okay, I won't judge the series just based on the first book. I'm sure the stakes get higher and there's more character development as time goes on. I'll keep reading, but now it just might not at the top of my TBR."
491,492,2,An action packed book with a 12 year old boy. Percy had no personality besides begin a son of a god. He loves his mom and then he's given a quest. Predictable but not in a clever or impressive way. I'd probably stick around for Annabeth but she wasn't given a chance either. I'd like to expand here more but I just want to put this book behind me.
492,493,2,"1: I don't buy the protagonist being 12, not even a little bit. At least 16, and every time the book tells me otherwise I'm just like ""Liar.""

2: Hero story -- all characters are more or less irrelevant, including the protagonist.

3: Lots of Greek monsters for fans of them.

Meh, it's all right."
493,494,2,"To be honest, I LOVE the way Rick Riordan writes, but this book just didn't stick with me, neither did the rest of the books in this series (besides the fifth book). I preferred The Heroes of Olympus. This book felt too repetitive and it got pretty boring for me."
494,495,2,"Basically just moves from one action scene to the next, which… needs some breathing room. There were some funny moments and a decent incorporation of Greek mythology into the modern world, but overall it was just mediocre."
495,496,2,"Being neither a child nor a fantasy lover, it is not surprising I didn't love this book. I do however appreciate that these books and this author are well loved. I imagine my boys will enjoy them very much when they're old enough, it's just not my thing."
496,497,2,"This book was not that great. In my opinion, this book was to slow paced and the storyline bored me to death and I was ready to be done. I would recommend this to anyone who likes books that are about Greek mythology."
497,498,2,"It was a good read, light hearted and enjoyable but i felt that it was lacking in some aspects. The character development could be improved on but i think that comes along with the continuation of the series."
498,499,2,"I thought this book was absolutely boring. the beginning is slow, and it seems like the plot goes on forever, and is hard to follow along with. i do not recommend this book to people that get bored easily"
499,500,2,It was ok but just not my cup of tea. I liked Percy as a character but the plot felt a little scattered. Maybe I just didn't read this book at the right age but I didn't feel connected to the story. I'm still debating about continuing to read the next book.
500,501,2,"I swear I read this book, maybe I just watched the movie. Anyway, I read another Riordan series and it was the same exact story. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't always bother me, but I must just care less about this one."
501,502,2,This is a book one of a young-adult fantasy series that resembles Harry Potter in certain ways though with a mythology theme. I own all 5 books but have not read them in a long time. It was OK but does not deserve to sit on my shelf now that I'm more discerning about what books I keep.
502,503,2,"I would have loved this as a twelve year old, and I can see why high school teachers cream themselves over this book (foreshadowing! Mythological parallels! Learning disabilities framed as strengths!). Alas, not doing it for me at this point of my life. Might pick up the sequels though."
503,504,2,"Ugh. Reading it to catch up with J, we are supposed to read the series together. Just a bit worse than I expected but glad to see the mythology work its way into the series in a new way. Definitely super unfair to even review a kids book after reading Madeline Miller and Neil gaiman..."
504,505,2,I'm kind of surprised this book is so popular. I found it cheesy and rolled my eyes at how often things just happened to work out so easily. The only reason I gave it two stars was because it was obviously well researched. I learned a lot about Greek mythology.
505,506,2,"Not bad at all, though I feel a bit too old to thoroughly enjoy these. I probably would have devoured them when I was younger. It was pretty rad to read an explicitly ADHD protagonist, with a canonical in-universe explanation for how he's hardwired that way and uses it to his advantage!"
506,507,2,I read this because my daughter loved this book as a middle schooler and continues to reread and enjoy it. I thought it was OK. I couldn't muster much empathy for the main character but I enjoyed the imagination of the author.
507,508,2,"Rick Riordan is apparently not a very good writer. A lot of his writing is, in fact, a bit painful. Even so, he managed to create a halfway decent story that worked well for my being in a mood for a book that didn't require much effort on behalf of the reader."
508,509,2,"2,5/5

510,511,2,"An easy, fast-paced read. Not my favorite, but a nice mental break. The Greek mythology based YA I enjoyed when I was in late middle and early high school was that series about the muses by Clea Hantman.
I think I found this a bit awkward largely because of the target reader level."
511,512,2,"I hate giving this 2 stars- it's completely my fault for not reading it until 19 and after the films making it seem like every event was so disjointed and just like a checkpoint for each scene to take place, and obviously a childish writing style because it's meant for 12 year olds. Sorry."
512,513,2,I expected to like it more based on what others had said. Thought it was pretty cheesy and predictable. Tried to hard it seemed. Maybe it’s just because I don’t like the Greek Mythology stuff. Not interested in reading sequels.

0,1,5,"I'm slightly ashamed to say that I watched the movie before I read the book. But I'm even more ashamed that I watched the movie only to experience the hotness that is Logan Lerman.



But, come on! Someone tell me that , is not hot:



Really. What did I tell you? (I do imagine that you probably won't read the rest of the review anf just stare at this gif instead, but that's no reason not to like my review! :D)

But, I really have to thank Logan. I really do. Because without his unfreakingbelieveable hotness, I wouldn't have watched the movie, and I would've never read the awesomeness of The Lightning Thief.

Yes, I loved the book. I've always taken an interest in Greek Mythology and I thought Rick Riordan's take on it was very unique, and unlike anything I've read before.

I absolutely loved Camp- Halfblood. Well, it sure seemed better than the budget summer camps I've been to. RR seriously out did himself with writing the camp. I could imagine everything vividly and I like to think that I know the camp from back to front. The cabins would have to be my favourite feature of the camp, though. If only they were like that in the camps I've been to.



Percy. What can I say? The guy has amazing underwater powers, is kick- ass and is a demigod. He's super loyal to his friends and family, is brave and has the looks (this is the part when you look at the gif of Logan Lerman again ;D). And he can make me laugh. Come on. You have to give a guy who make you laugh some credit. In short, the guy's the full package.

Another thing I loved were the other characters. Especially Annabeth, who looks like Cinderella in Percy's words (am I right? I don't have the book on me, sorry. Stupid library fines). And I'm expecting something to develop between her and Percy, if you know what I mean....



So, yeah. I loved the book, it was exciting, fast- paced and humorous. Just one thing though, I'm kind of pissed that they didn't have cabins in the movie. Or Clarisse. Or the Oracle. Though it's hardly RR's fault. I just had to get it out there."

5,6,5,"Chapter One: I Accidentally Vaporize the Person who Tried to Take this Book Away from Me

Look, I didn't want to be obsessed.
If you're reading this because you think you're only going to read The Lightning Thief once, my advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about binge-reading, and try to be a normal person.
Being obsessed with this book is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed because you want to read it just one more time.
If you're a normal kid, reading this book because you were forced to, great. Read on. I envy you for being able to believe you're immune to being obsessed.
But if you recognize yourself in these pages - if you feel something stirring inside - stop reading immediately. You might be becoming a member of the Percy Party. And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before you read it again. And again. And again.
Don't say I didn't warn you."
6,7,5,"I've read all (I think) of this series to my daughter, Celyn, but somehow this one escaped being reviewed until now.

I half-watched the film a year or two before we read this. Actually it was Rick reading (and being kind enough to review) my own trilogy that steered me toward picking up these books for Celyn (she's very disabled and can't read books for herself).

Anyway, it was a very good read. Celyn enjoyed the action and humour, and I enjoyed seeing the Greek legends I loved reading about as a kid given a new lease of life, offered up to the most recent generation.

It starts off with that irresistible device beloved of fantasy books that you (vicariously the hero) were meant for more than this regular old world and that all those odd things you don't understand about everyday life ... really are odd and full of special meaning. In fact ... your dad's a god, and not just any old god but Poseidon himself. And that means you're part god yourself! Hoorah!

So Percy gets inducted into hero school, makes friends with good monsters, fights and kills bad ones, and dives into adventure.

The hero school (Camp Halfblood) has demi-gods descended from all the Greek mythos, which makes for fun conflicts. Meanwhile in the wider world there are rumblings that the titans (from whom the gods wrested control of the world at the dawn of time) are about to stage a comeback. Zeus has lost his lightning bolt and the thief must be found before the gods fall to blows and Olympus topples.

The genius is in the mix of modern day America with all its kitsch, landmarks, cities etc with mythical Greece. It shouldn't really work, but does. And to cap it all, your kid is getting a classical education on the sly!

I am getting around to reading this series.



I thought the movies were okay, I do wish they would remake them and make them better, like the books =)

Poor Percy.














Most people already know the story of Percy Jackson and how he found out he was a half-blood. How he ended up in a half-blood camp (almost didn't) How he beat a Minotaur and later on, many things.

I thought it was a fun read and I loved all of the different mythical creatures! That was so wicked cool!

Percy makes some good friends in the camp and they go with him to do a quest. He has been blamed for stealing something from Zeus, which he did not, so they have to set out to find who really did it. Other wise there is going to be some knock down drag out with Zeus and Percy's father (Poseidon) and others of course.

So they set out on this quest.



They have to go have a little chat with Hades <-- fun times. They get attacked by many creatures of all shapes and sizes. They also get help from certain creatures and a pink poodle named Gladiola who ran away from home and doesn't want to go back but does so the kids can have some reward money. Wasn't that sweet!



↑ Can you blame little Gladiola? I mean I love the color pink, but NO, JUST NO!

Anyhoo, I did want to smack the group a few times because of stupid things, but who doesn't do those from time to time. *raises hand* I loved when they saved the animals in the old truck they were riding in, Grover is awesome!

I look forward to reading ALL of the other 50 billion books in this ongoing Rick Riordan world! ♥

MY BLOG:"
9,10,5,"Perfect for those who love mythology

This should come as no big shocker given that my pen name is Lisa of Troy, but I love Greek mythology. The problem with Greek mythology is that the language is so archaic that I usually spend more time reading the reference materials than the original text.

Recently, there have been some efforts to modernize the myths and make them more accessible.

The Lightning Thief jumps right into action, no 100-page warm-up here. No droning on and on about Greek mythology. It is also highly readable with short paragraphs and sentences.

One thing that I didn’t like is the portrayal of the Greek gods. In Greek mythology, the gods are heartless. No one is safe even children. This is one aspect that makes mythology so shocking; it doesn’t follow traditional social norms. The Lightning Thief is geared towards the YA audience, so I suppose Riordan made the right call in toning the book down a bit.

The Lightning Thief is so good that I picked up a buddy reader. I was listening to the audiobook on the couch (that happens more than you would think), and my family member started listening too. I kept asking if I could read the book by myself, and I kept being told, “No! No! You have to wait for me!” We ended up reading the entire book in about two days.

Would I read the next book in the series? You bet!"
10,11,5,"Riordan enters the Mount Olympus of comedic fantasy

By smartly combining the old classic tales with modern settings
It´s a bit like Good Omens by Pratchett and Gaiman, just as a longer series and with a focus on fast, funny, and creative clashes of old mythology and today's life. The message, as so often, is that

It´s completely ok to be different
And that individual character traits and issues are nothing that legitimizes stigmatization, or the tendency to give pills and psychotropic drugs instead of alternatives such as therapy in not so severe cases. But that´s more of an unimportant sidenote, the really big riddle and mystery is the question which manifestation of a classic god will come next in which outfit, style, and with which modified abilities. This searching for the signs, hints, and innuendos is

What makes it so appealing for adult readers too
It´s not just quick, clever, and witty, one is also permanently questioning which obvious or deep and subtle disguise ones favorite mythological figure might have chosen. Riordan milked this concept in other series with different mythologies from around the world, or at least Scandinavia and Egypt (as far as I know but I´m a bit outdated so there might already be fresher serialized stuff ) and it always worked out fine because it´s so fresh and original. And even Gods have to evolve to stay up to date, funky, and fresh for the true believer.

If you like that kind of easygoing, but still ironic and somewhat even postmodern, kind of entertainment in the comedic fantasy YA and adult sector, Terry Pratchett, Jonathan Stroud, Walter Moers, Brandon Mull, and everything in similar amazon comparison or goodreads listopia genre/author meta suggestion function could be your new reading drug of choice. But be aware, it´s such fun to consume that one tends to just read dozens of these giggle pearls instead of more complex and difficult to read stuff. At least if one is such a lazy master procrastinator as I am.

Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:"
11,12,5,"My inner child is absolutely devastated that I didn't read this series when I was a kid. Percy Jackson was one of those series that was always there, just on the periphery of my social conscious. I knew I should read it, but for one reason or another I gravitated to other things instead.


Thankfully, as an adult who likes reviewing books for fun in my spare time, I have absolutely no shame about reading the series now, even if it was originally intended for a younger audience. In some ways, I think I might have even enjoyed it more as an adult.

I'm a huge fan of Greek mythology. (I may or may not have filled electives in high school and college with classes on mythology; just like I may or may not have obsessed over shows like Xena and Hercules in my teenage years.) I had a great time comparing my own personal knowledge of Greek mythology against the ways that Riordan weaves the stories into Percy's larger adventure.

It's such a fun way to introduce Greek mythology to children and teens while staying entertaining for adults as well! The mythology remains faithful to the original stories, but it feels fresh and fun here as each character is full of personality and charm. The world is full of magic and wonder and I never once felt bored as the characters explored within it.

Speaking of characters full of personality, Percy Jackson himself is one of my new faves in terms of characterization. He's brave, loyal and hilarious and his friendship with Grover and Annabeth has quickly become a favorite for me. Also, can I just say that I think it's so cute that Riordan based Percy on his son, who had been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia? I think it's so awesome that Percy gets to sort of stand apart from other heroes in stories as a champion for those kids forevermore.

When I finished reading this book, I immediately went and told my 11 year old nephew that he absolutely had to read this book so I had someone to talk to about it. I'm proud to call myself a Percy Jackson fan and will be continuing the rest of the series shortly!

★★★★★ = 5 stars!

12,13,5,"Really is there something I could say that hasn't been said? Doubtful, but in utterly stupid human style I will write a review anyway attempting to tell people how cool this book is.

This is plainly an awesome idea. I had always wondered what happened to the kids of half gods/goddess and humans. Here's the story to quench your curiosity. Percy Jackson has been dumped around from border school to border school. He has never been quite like anybody else, but as the end of sixth grade approaches he'll find out how unique he actually is...

I picked this up thinking that I would enjoy it, but not to the extent of really being so fast. Literally from the first pages I knew I was gonna finish this book. It's geared towards middle grade readers and mostly male I think, but really all that goes away when you're reading this. As an older reader I did see most of the twists coming but that is because the author is generous about hints, which I have always liked. What really sold it for me though is the action. I have mentioned this numerous times, but I'll say it again, . Give me a good fight sequence and I'm there.

A few reviews mention how this is ripoff of Harry Potter, and now that I think about it I could see where they are coming from. There are definitely similarities, but to be honest I didn't really catch that, (I guess I'm kind of dim...I shouldn't probably admit to that *shakes head* moving on) because the world the author set was so original that the similar setup can be easily forgiven.

We all love heroes. Especially ones like Percy. People never expect much from him, and that's what makes this journey of his so personal to the reader. You root for him and are so glad that his muscling his way through it. It has the feel of cheering for the underdog. And I'm guessing this underdog is going to blow everyone out of the water.

This Book/Series/Universe is a ""must read"" to anyone who loves myths, Regardless of Age. {for proof: I read it first when I was 22 & fell in love immediately by the first sentences! (which was the chapter's title!)} though it probably depends on you have active inner child & love mythology in modern days with lots of fun or not too. (my dad liked it too.)
it's an art to write a book suitable for everyone.
& Percy's character reminded me of one of my teenage years bookish crush, Bobby in series by D. J. MacHale; sassy, quick witty comebacks with funny thoughts & comparisons in the narration.

The Lightning Thief is a book that is very close to my heart. I loved it as a child, and I loved it as I grew up and had much heavier tastes in the fantasy genre, but I still love it. If whoever is reading this book, if you don't like this book, then I am really, really sorry, but we can't ever be friends. Like, I know everyone has different tastes, but still, my heart can't take any sort of criticism for this book. I love this book so much.





Percy, a 12-year-old kid with ADHD and dyslexia, is the protagonist of The Lightning Thief. He had been expelled out of schools for the majority of his life for reasons he was not responsible for. But when his instructor transforms into a monster on a school trip and his other teacher saves him, he realises his life is about to change drastically. We then follow his experiences as his mother is kidnapped, he is sent to a camp he has never heard of, he discovers that his best friend is a satyr and his favourite teacher is a centaur. And the worst of all, he discovers that his father isn't human but a god, making him a demigod. Now, I'm not going to go into too much detail about the plot because you should read it for yourself.My only purpose was to raise your curiosity so that I can trick you into reading this favourite book of mine.






Let's talk about Annabeth. I love her. She is the daughter of Athena, the goddess of wisdom. She is smart, clever, brave, and full of logic, and she is the main reason for their mission's success (this may sound biased, but that's what I believe).Grover is a satyr who pretended to be Percy's friend before he knew of his demigod blood, but became an actual friend over the course of the book. He is the comedian of the trio. His backstory is sad. I felt so bad for him because of the guilt he was carrying for not being able to save Thalia and complete the task he was given.I love you too, Grover. Luke is the son of the god Hermes, the god of so many things that I lost track of them. I never hated him, but I am saying this after reading the complete series, so... 

If you haven't read this book then you are missing out on a lot of fun."

-------------------
Smoothly you step into the character, Percy, the narrator.. His life, bits about his past, then bit by bit into the conflict(s), then the Greek Mythology … then the Quest(s)..
Finding the Lighting Thief... which is not as easy as it seem..

ups and down with thriller and chilling and creepy and even funny parts. Everything smooth and well explained with what serve book one -with hints that sure will serve later books-

(4.99)
------------
See above. I truly rarely felt like that with most new YAs… always there's this boring slow parts that show up every now and then.
here everything measured , not too heavy boring flashbacks nor prolonged scene full of rant as many action YAs... it's like the amazing Harry Potter pace if u know what I mean.


(4.5)
--------------------------
I loved Percy, really. May be because everything smoothly introduced. And he just keep in character, I mean for 12 years old kid, would you believe he'd go to the dangerous underworld to retrieve the Lighting weapon from The Lighting Thief? Just because some gods will do wars for it? “Blaa-ha-ha!”.
Well... when you read his reason and motivation you'll find that it's more believable and true to the character.
And I love that.

Also having Attention Defucit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Dyslexia as well as it served an important point of making the high fantasy of the Greek Myth into our real world-urban- fantasy, it also a good touch to encourage any kid who suffers that -which is bit more than you may think- anyone can be hero.. just don't make it stops you. Percy didn't stop trying to read the whole book.. -kinda-

Annabith also was a fun to read. So smart. Groover... also this good ""strange"" friend..
And I also loved the mother and her love of Blue food.


Also all the other characters are very well introduced.. just as every thing.

(4.5)
--------------------
Very easy lines, smart, wit, not just for the young age but really for all. -unlike my previous encounter with Magnus.- It's so funny here and in the point.

(5)
---------------------------------------
It's not supposed to be a horror story. But it has a lot of creepy places the friends visit.. Like this ""Ever after"" Las Vegas Casino...or Medusa's Shop for statues.

And also the way Rick Riordan writes the nightmare scenes is really full of horror and creepy symbols.

And speaking of symbols ;

(5)
--------------------------------
I am NOT a fan of Fantasy, I just prefer, rather adore URBAN FANTASY
But this one really smartly written, with real references to actual myths or work of art and literature work.

I loved how Mr. Rick connect the prosperity of the ancient Greek myth and civilisation with the current American one.
His theory here is so smart..and convenient enough to fall in love and immerse into his well crafted world..

And if you're, like me, not feeling well about the gods concept.. he also have a convenient idea here ;




So, as I said, it's the amazing blending of the myth with real life in America is what makes it an excellent Urban Fantasy..

And speaking of America.

(4.5)
(4.99)

----------------------------------
Although the first story for Percy supposed to be just an ""introduction"" to this world, but you find yourself gotten into a hell of adventure full of crazy chase and creepy places hidden in real world..
There's this great concept of ""the Mist"", that surrounding the myth creatures among us as the story goes..

This theme of mist repeated in a good measure to keep the illusion that it's real story happening in our real world in a real famous places along the US.

And I loved visiting about 3 or 4 states and important places there through the first adventure only...and I believe more is coming in this Adventure Packed series..


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So, finally... if you're a Harry Potter fan..or any newer YA fantasy fan... or if you're old school mythology fan, you'll love to join us the Half Blood Camp.. trust me.

A special thanks to my half blood friends who encouraged me repeatedly on starting this amazing series , thanks again truly I'd never read it without your recommendation -felt I was too old to join another huge,full of books and many series.
but Rick Riordant really worth the read. He got his style,, may be reminded me with Harry Potter's first book structure..but wasn't it the greatest structure ever?
The point that he used it creating a whole new exciting crazy myth/modern adventure..

Some friends and I are doing a reread of this series in light of the TV series announcement, so yeah! Finished rereading this one for the...fourth time I guess? And I truly never tire of it, still one of my absolute favorite books/series of all time.

I feel like my previous reviews pretty much sum up my thoughts so I’ll just leave it at that haha, anyway my older reviews of it are below.

—



Well I feel like I've rewritten/updated my review of this like a billion times at this point, but I'm here to do it again. I re-read this over the span of the past two days when I had to take two super-long bus trips. This was the third time I've read the whole thing, I'm pretty sure (kind of the fourth time I guess, since I read a lot of it out loud to my younger siblings last year). There are few books that I loved when I was 12 that I still deeply love now, and this is one of those few books. In fact, the more times I read it the more I fall in love with it. I adore the series as a whole and think it develops so wonderfully as it goes along, and sometimes I almost forget how great the first book is. Maybe it's not the strongest of the series, but it's still fantastic. It's exciting, it's hilarious, there are so many lovable characters and great character development/backstories/etc. and as a giant mythology nerd I love how all the Greek myths are tied in and modernized. The rest of the series just gets better and better, and I love the Heroes of Olympus series as well––and it always makes me happy to go back to where it all started, and remember why I first fell in love with this book/series nine years ago. (Gosh that makes me feel old.)

I knew I missed this series and its world. I didn’t know how much until I started reading.

I was emotional, excited, and so incredibly happy to reconnect with some of my favorite characters.

I can’t wait to reread the rest😭"

Look, I didn't want to get sucked into the world of PJO.
If you think it's not that deep, great I envy you. If you recognise yourself in my over dramatic reviews and updates- ahh okay I'll stop😂

Honestly this book holds a special place in my heart. I randomly picked it up in my school library years ago simply cause I was bored. But once I started reading, I knew this book was IT. I DEVOURED it. Just like I did today lol.

Percy Jackson has always been one of my all time favourite characters. And re-reading this series is going to be major FUN. I honestly miss books like these.

Man, what a journey it's going to be 🥺 Can't wait to re-live all the quests, cliffhangers (painful laugh) and the iconic battles.

Until then, 'Take care Seaweed Brain.'

22,23,5,lo amo demasiado
23,24,5,"How do I begin to explain the awesomeness that is this series...?



Percy Jackson is flawless.

It has two Celestial bronze daggers and a sliver chariot.

I hear its pages are insured for $10,000.

I hear it does Diet Coke commercials in Greece.

Its favorite movie is Disney's Hercules.

One time, it met JK Rowling on a plane and she told it it was the next Harry Potter.

One time, it punched me in the feels... It was awesome!"
24,25,5,"Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon and prince of our hearts.
He can look like Logan Lerman or Walker Scobell, but one thing is for sure: he's gonna steal the show.

This is the third time I have re-read the book and every time I'm shocked at how different it is from the movie. I mean, the movie is not that bad. But if you've read the book first, then it's pretty bad.
And who's fault is that? Rick Riordan’s, who wrote an awesome story.

We have action, fights, touching moments, big plot twists and a whole new vision of life.
Furthermore, don't forget the history. You can love it or you can hate it, but willingly or not you're gonna learn some Greek culture. For Europeans is just amazing to find again what you've learned in elementary school, but it's also kind of a learning process for everyone else.
And even if meant for kids, Riordan’s narration is perfect for all ages.

One thing changed over the years, tho. Now I'm older, my sight of reality is not the same, and even if I love the old Rick, I can't neglect how impressive are Americans to make everything about themselves.
This is GREEK culture, and later it’ll become ROMANS, but still, the Gods now live above the Empire State Building, New York, USA. The same guys who can't control guns or have safe abortions are the cradle of the West.
When you're twelve you crave to follow the American Dream; when you're twenty you shake at the thought of moving to a country where there isn't even a decent Health System.

Rick Riordan created this reality inside our world that is not only impressive but also fascinating.
And I can't wait to read all about it."
25,26,5,"I unfortunately saw the movie first, however I still loved this book! Definitely a new favourite. I really understand all the hype because it is just fantastic, action packed, and totally engaging.
I was really shocked at how different it was than the movie which I think is why I was still able to really enjoy it"
26,27,5,"Percy Jackson is 12 and was like, ""y'know what yeah I'm gonna fight a god"". Who else does it like him?!"
27,28,5,"I started reading Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief on 2/1/2019 and finished it on 2/12/2019. I started out buddy reading this book with my 7 year old son but he finished it before me and took the Advanced Reading test at school on it and scored 100%. This book is an excellent read! I love that it’s fast paced. It’s so easy to read and Percy is really a likable guy despite his troubles with school. I love his bond with his mom. Percy is brave and he doesn’t leave his friends when they are in trouble. I like the friendship he has with Grover. I’m surprised to read “punk” coming out of Ares and Gabe’s mouth. I haven’t heard of that word in awhile, but then again, this book publishes back in 2006.

This book is told in the first person point of view following Percy Jackson, 12 years old half-blood and a student at Yancy Academy, private school for troubled kids. Percy doesn’t have an easy time growing up. He has to attend boarding school and live away from his mom. At school, trouble seems to find him and so in six years, he has attended six schools. Recently he sees his math teacher turns into a monster that tries to kill him. It scares his friend, Grover and his mom to the point that he is hauled off to summer camp. This camp is specialize for all Half-Bloods or Demigods; in other words, people who are half human and half God. From camp, Percy finds out who his father is and the reason for the bad weather happening currently. He learns that he must go on a quest to find the stolen weapon that Zeus lost and return to him before the war between the Gods break loose.

Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is very well written and action packed. The problem for me reading this book is watching the movie first. The movie doesn’t do the book justice at all. It ruins my enjoyment for the book much more than I thought it would. I like that the book has the basic explanation on who the Gods are and their family ties, like Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, and Kronos. It’s great to read this book to learn about basic Greek mythology. Percy is not a perfect kid with perfect family along with Annabeth, fellow half-blood, and more likely readers can relate to them in some way. I highly recommend everyone to read this book because it’s definitely a book for everyone.

Pro: fast paced, page turner, bravery, friendship, humor, teamwork, challenges, family

Con: none

I rate it 5 stars!

PERCY?

I AM ENAMORED BY HIM. HIS NO-shits given attitude and his sense of humour? I’m a goner. Yall weren’t hyping him up for nothing.

I was surprised by the dark undertone in the book and it was completely unexpected. And I loved it more than I should have considering this is for a younger audience.

The thing I loved best about this book (other than Percy ofc) was his relationship with his mom. I teared up so many times, on their every interaction, it was so special 😭😭.

All in all! FREAKING AMAZING 🤩

29,30,5,"“Even strength must bow to wisdom sometimes.”

This is one of my favorite books of all time. How have I not reviewed this? Probably because I read these like 5 years ago and I forgot everything lol. I am so glad I re-read this!



Now y'all are probably wondering why this took me so long to finish. I mean it took me almost 3 weeks to finish a 375 page book. The answer is, I did not expect it to take this long. I was planning to read it in one day, but the thing is, I read one chapter aloud to my mom and sister. And after that chapter, they were hooked.

So why did it take me so long? Because I read all those 375 pages aloud to my family lol. It was tiring, but honestly I think it was worth it. My mom and sister are now officially Percy Jackson fans. Welcome them to the club!



Wait...so does this mean I have to read the whole series to them...? Oh wow- If I , I'll be getting some very strong vocal chords lol.

Anyways, moving on to the review. This book was amazing! I am surprised I didn't re-read this earlier. I forgot a lot of the details! Lovable characters, interesting plot, and amusing writing, I loved it! These books are definitely one of my childhood favorites. <33

Let's start with the engrossing

The plot was probably my favorite part of the story! I love how Riordan created the concept of there being a mortal world, and then a Greek mythology world. It is truly fascinating. If you are a fan of Greek mythology this is totally for you!

Percy Jackson, the main character, has been kicked out of many schools. He has challenged teachers, and doesn't have good grades. It doesn't help that he has ADHD and dyslexia either. But, when his math teacher turns into a demon and tries to kill him, Percy is shocked. What the heck just happened?

He is then whisked away to a summer camp called Half-Blood, where his best friend is a satyr. You know, the usual. Anyways, when he arrives at Camp Half-Blood, he is claimed as the son of


After than, Chiron, one of the people in charge of the camp, talks to him. Someone has stolen Zeus's lightning bolt, but who? Zeus thinks it was Poseidon, since they have had a rivalry for thousands of years. But, Poseidon can't directly steal the bolt, so Zeus suspects that Percy stole it for him.

Percy is then sent on a quest with two friends, Grover and Annabeth, to find Zeus's bolt and avoid getting killed.

But things are not so simple. With demons after them, Zeus mad at them, and many other obstacles, it is almost impossible for the trio to complete the mission.

But the three kids all prove to be valuable members of the team. They face down the obstacles, and continue onward.

I really loved how Riordan weaves Greek mythology into the modern world. It had its own unique vibe and I enjoyed it.

The story line here was awesome. The plot twists were quite crazy! I mean, I knew all the plot twists since this was a re-read, but I really enjoyed my mother and sister's reactions when plot twists were revealed lol.

It was the best when my mom and sister found out that
or when




One thing about the plot: It never gets old. I loved it. Even after five years, I have not outgrown it. I don't think I ever will. It just holds so much nostalgia for me. I swear, I could reread the book right now and still not be bored.


Onto the

Percy was amazing! He is funny, rebellious, and determined. I honestly really enjoyed him narrating the story. He is quite amusing. Percy, the son of
thinks he's worthless. Because he has dyslexia and ADHD he feels like he's useless. It doesn't help that he's flunking at school and his step-dad hates him.

But when he sets out on a quest to find the lightning bolt, there is a lot of character development in him! Riordan depicts a lot of conflict in him. Like him wanting to please his father, while also being mad at him. Or him


He definitely grew a lot! He grew from a boy who didn't believe in himself, to a man who survived a lot of demon attacks, confronted gods, and made life-long friends. I really liked his growth! And the fact that he still has the same personality after all that growth definitely warms my heart.



I love Grover! He is so sweet, generous, and considerate.

Similar to Percy, Grover also had insecurities about himself.

Since he had failed in a previous quest, he keeps underestimating himself and does not see his full potential. But when he meets Annabeth and Percy, they help him believe in himself.

It felt so good to see him at the end...all grown up and confident. He grew up so much!



Ah. Behold, my favorite character. The moment she said, ""You drool,"" I felt attached to her loll. Annabeth, the daughter of Athena is a witty, smart girl with a lot of sass.



I thought at first that she was perfect. She had wits, sass, and a rebellious streak in her. But now that I think of it, I think she grew too. Since she was kicked out of her home and sent to the camp, Annabeth hardly trusted anyone. She refused to open her heart to anyone. But throughout the book, I can see her trust in Grover and Percy increase. Maybe trusting in others is not so bad after all.

She was even given the guts to write to her father asking if their relationship could be fixed. I really loved her growth and personality!

I think the reason why she was my favorite character was because I relate to her a lot.

Continuing on to the

Can I just say that Rick Riordan's writing is so nostalgic? I'm not sure why, but it reminds me of my childhood so much. Riordan's writing is quick and witty. He cracks jokes frequently and knows how to write a good action scene. There is no excessive gore, and yet he manages the keep the plot engaging. I really like his style of writing. It is very laid-back yet action-packed. Does that make sense?



Anyways, I really love his writing! I would be able to recognize it anywhere lol.

To conclude, Percy Jackson is a masterpiece. No one will convince me otherwise. Even my sister and mom loved it.

If I ever have children, I will be reading this saga to them. Huge fan of you Uncle Rick! <3

Plus the Annabeth / Percy dynamic is pure gold :))"
31,32,5,"reading these books feels like a warm hug; it feels like coming home. no matter how old i am, i will always laugh at percy's antics and the adventures he gets into. i am absolutely in love with riordan's simplistic yet riveting writing, and his talent for creating heroes that we all root for and come to adore.

also every time i bring up this series to someone or vice versa i just think about ""Braccas meas vescimini!"" and how it meant ""eat my pants"" in latin because i too would probably say something like that when faced with a murderous monster"

“The real world is where the monsters are.”

I guess since I reread this, for perhaps the billionth time in my life, I now get the opportunity to review it. Hopefully, I don't screw this up.

I didn’t like Harry Potter when I was little (though I love it now, and that’s all that matters), but I can imagine that my feelings towards Percy Jackson reflect those that many people who grew up with Harry have. I couldn’t get enough of the story, I told everyone I knew to read it, and I impatiently waited for the next release.

I was ten when I read PJO for the first time, only two years younger than Percy himself in the first book. Now, I am the same age as Percy, perhaps a year or so older. As Percy has grown, so have I. Through the trials of my life, and through the trial of his fictional one, it’s as if we’ve grown together, and no matter what we do, we just can’t escape one another. People complain about Rick not letting this world go, but I disagree. I just don’t think I could ever let go either, as this story is a huge part of my life.

I remember ordering The Lightning Thief from a Scholastic book Magazine and receiving it at school a few weeks later. I remember sitting down and reading it for the first time ever, and loving every word. I remember spending every penny I got for Christmas on books 2-4. I remember finishing them and going to my school library craving more books on Greek Mythology. Then, one day in May, when The Last Olympian was finally released, I remember sending all the money I saved up with my mother for her to pick it up at Barnes and Noble during her lunch break. I remember taking the beautiful black book out to recess the next day to read it on the playground. The Percy Jackson books changed my 10 year old life, and it has influenced my current tastes in books and the person I am today.

I don't know where to go with this review, but I think I should talk about the characters for at least a few paragraphs. As a child, the cast was one of the first I've ever read that I could entirely relate too.

Take Percy Jackson, a young boy unsure of himself, who doesn't know where or if he belongs. Watch him learn that being different is okay, watch him become powerful and still stay humble. Or Take Annabeth, the smart girl with ambitions bigger than herself, and watch her evolve to someone who is more than just smart, but caring and wise. Even take Grover, the awkward kid with dreams of saving nature, and watch him slowly get the chance to actually live his dreams.

Yet, I want to talk about my favorite character in the series, perhaps one of my favorite fictional characters of all time: Luke. As a child, I didn't understand why I loved him so much. I found myself always rooting for him even if I probably shouldn't. With this reread, since it's been almost 6 years since I have last reread it, I thought that my more mature mind would finally see the evil traitor that others see in him. Yet, I found myself loving him even more than I previously did, and I finally figured out why I liked him so much, and I know my explanation is going to get confusing, so bare with me.

The reason: he's easy to understand.

Many antagonists in books are hazy, you don't get where they are coming from. Luke is different, it's easy to pick up why he hates the Gods so much, how they have made him feel used. He's done all these things for them, and he doesn't even receive a simple thank you. In later books, you see Percy struggle with the same issues. Percy has saved the world countless of times, had a year of his life taken away from him by the Queen of the Gods, gone through countless shit without much recognition. Even Percy is tired of the Gods, but unlike Luke, he doesn't turn evil and try to take down Olympus. I find Luke to be so interesting, because he can be used as a example of what makes Percy such a strong character. It's a Neville vs Wormtail situation. It's what could have been. I find it an interesting way to develop a character. It makes me love Luke just way too much.

It makes me love this series just way too much. It's one that I will never grow to hate, but will stay with me for ages. I will reread it more times to count, force my children one day to read it, and I will love it more with each read.

To me, this series is revolutionary."

35,36,5,"If you like Harry Potter, you will probably like this book, too. Come to think of it, if you do not like HP, you may still like this book. Recommended reading ages are grades 5-9 but if you're younger and like to read this book may very well be fine . . . and, this book is actually written well enough for adults to enjoy as well.



Tale focuses on a 12 year old boy named Percy who isn't getting along with just about everyone in school and soon discovers part of his problems are related to the fact that he's the son of the Greek God, Poseidon, which leads him to a training camp for Half-Bloods/Demigods and then a quest to stop the Zeus and Poseidon from tearing the whole world apart.



(1)Told in first person narrative and therefore flows particularly well.;
(2) Hip and cutting edge enough, focusing on popular, trendy spots like Las Vegas, at one point, for instance.;
(3) Well detailed info on mythology so one could learn a lot without cracking open a mythology book. A lot of the details are woven into the story rather than just told to you.;
(4) Some really funny lines or events;
(5) Well established relationship with his mortal mother;
(6) Some good action scenes that focus on Greek Mythology; and
(7) A few surprised even the veterans of fantasy reading won't spot.



(1)For adults, if you don't like archetypes and standard story archetypes, you may find this a bit predictable in certain parts. Remember that it's written for young readers.; and
(2) Percy tends to fall into a few jams because he doesn't think things through. He's twelve so I suppose he gets some slack for that but then he also does some smart things so judge it as you will."

“All three of you?”

Oh my god this book!! It's seriously the only thing that even comes close to Harry Potter.
Percy is definitely one of the best main characters ever created.I love him. I mean and dsylectic hero with ADHD?? How could he be more awesome?
I really wish I had known about this book as a kid when I was struggling in school because of my ADHD, but I feel like this book will help a lot of others and make them fell represented.
It's also one of the few books, I can see myself forcing my future children to read in 20 years. Buuuut if I'm completly honest I can also see myself disowing them if they hate it.

It will forever be one of my favourites and I am so ready to re-read the other books as well!"
37,38,5,Another reread for the month! I love how my opinion about this book hasn't changed since I first read it in 5th grade. Percy Jackson is hilarious and I love his voice throughout the book. I can't wait to read the rest of the series when I have the chance.

La verdad es que me la he pasado súper bien con cada página.

Still as great as ever. Are there flaws? Certainly. Now that I’m not the same age as the main characters, it's far easier to read this book critically, and it can be hard to ignore some of the (mostly small) problems. That being said, this book still gets a perfect 5 stars from me, because I still love the characters, and I still love the story.

At this point, it’s impossible to not squeal every 3 seconds while reading this book. This series is one of the ones I grew up with, and the nostalgia alone is enough to get me to reread this series every so often. I know Goodreads has listed it as “reading for the 4th time”, but I have read this so many more times, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I only got Goodreads in 2017, after all.



Like I said before, if you still haven’t read this, chances are you just aren’t interested. But just in case you’re on the fence, PLEASE just try it! Keep an open mind, this is a middle-grade series so it’s not what you might be used to reading, but the experience is just so incredible. And once you get to the Heroes of Olympus series? You’ll be addicted.

P.S No, this series is not only for kids. Yes, you can still enjoy it as someone past the age of 12. Maybe the experience won't be the same, but it will still be rewarding!"

Re-reading this book had me so emotional because the amount of nostalgia I experienced, I missed this entire series so so much. I don't even if I can write down my feelings because it feels like an impossible thing.

the in this book is one you don't see in many others. First off, it's first person and Percy's pov. The descriptions are vivid enough to suck you into the Riordanverse and yet there is no over-description to the point that you get confused. Percy's inner thoughts made this book so much more fun. It was funny, sweet, and sarcastic. But at the same time, you what happens to him. You experience how he felt, unwanted and used. The quotes in it, no matter that it is technically shelved as a children's book, were honestly deep. They . It was such an intricately spun story, I the ideas that run through Rick Riordan's head.

the was one of the best and least confusing I've ever seen in a book. Being a New York obsessed girl, I loved the fact that the main setting was set there. Olympus being on top of the Empire State building? Yes please. The fact that it was set in America and not some fantasy world with names harder to pronounce than was so relieving after reading several fantasy books these days. The of making a book about Greek Gods and their mortal children is so creative, I wish I had Rick Riordan's brain. This book shows how it would've been to have modern Greek Gods. The famous people that were said to be demigods was so fun to read about, and how the gods fit into the lives of the mortals just made . And making your writing comprehensible is so hard to do . The idea of mist to change how humans see things so they can make everything fit into how they perceive things is one of the deepest and realest things I've read about this week and I'm genuinely questioning humanity at the moment.

the were so loveable. I don't think there's a single character in this book that I found annoying. From Luke to Grover, I connected with them on some level. They were written so well and with depth, it was entrancing. You get to see more to them than just the sunny days, you get to see their stormy days too. It's so hard to achieve this in books, because the abrupt change in mood can seem choppy. The way Luke switched up didn't feel choppy, it didn't feel , it felt believable. After reading the worst books of my life recently, I appreciated this part of the writing much. Everything about the character felt like it was flowing .

I'm super into Greek mythology. I don't get to study it much, since studies are using me like a punching bag, but its always intrigued me so much. Reading this made me so happy, all the Greek things. I'm literally such a nerd for it, it was so fun to read about. I adore Greek architecture, history, mythology, everything. The adaptations honestly made sense and were pretty reasonable.

percy is one of my absolute book boys, you don't even understand how much I adore this boy. He's funny, adorable, sarcastic, and . A dream. Annabeth saw hope and put her entire life investments into him fr 😭. No matter how fun reading about him was, there was also a different side to him than the humorous. The side that was struggling with the fact that he lost his mother, that he was the son of a , that he almost died several times. He felt used and unwanted, he felt left out. It was so hard to imagine what he might have been feeling being kicked out of multiple schools, even if I also have ADHD and, to pair along with it, GAD. Reading about him evolving, even minorly, from a kid to someone more mature. He's still thirteen, he went through much. His best friend is a half goat, a bull thingy ""killed"" his mother in front of him, his teacher turned out to be a thousands of years old horse thing, and among several other crazy things he met real . I think I'd probably just pick up a sandal, channel my inner Indian mother, slap some bitches, and call it a day before jumping off a very tall building. He's more mature than half the human population, it's honestly halarious and sad. To say that I'm excited to read about him in the next book is an understatement because I literally love him so much. The way he talked about his mom, it made my heart ache. And the way he cared for both of them, especially Grover? I almost cried, I missed the trio sm 💗

𝐀𝐧𝐧𝐚𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐡 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐞


and the first sentence I'm going to say about her is... yup, you guessed it! She's one of my favorite book girls 🤗. Annabeth is smart, strong, sharp. She's been through so much while so young, it was heartbreaking. She lost what she considered her best friend, she ran from home, she was bullied by her half siblings, her family hated her. But she was so strong and mature, I adored her. She's literally Hermione in another universe. She wanted to become an architect, wants to create one of the biggest and best monuments known to human kind. She took them on a tour to the Arch, and I found it soo cute. The way she had this mean little way of being nice, she's so me. I love this girl so much 🫶🏼. But one thing that was honestly so gag worthy was that she was seven and Luke was fourteen when they came to camp, meaning that he's now legal and she's not. That is 😦🫸🏼.

𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐔𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐰𝐨𝐨𝐝


I honestly love his lil guy so much, he's so adorable and cute. His little horns and his terrible reed pipe singing, all of it <3. He was a little scaredy cat, but he was so cute and perfect. He cared so much for his friends. When he told percy he faked everything he said ""except for being your friend"" 🥹.

𝐋𝐮𝐤𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐧
I honestly understood him, feeling unwanted. Obviously not the fact that he sided with Kronos, but you understand you know? And he was right too, when he said that all the gods did was use the demigods. Half of them were ""too busy to claim their children"". And it was so completely understandable. I connected with him on some level, what he did was wrong but his motives were absolutely and fully understandable.

they're still so young and they own my entire heart 🥹🫶🏼

the way they're still so young and it's only the first book but Percabeth was killing me already 😭❤️‍🩹"
41,42,5,this was my roman empire
42,43,5,"I am now rereading the series for what could possibly be the gazillionth time. And it is as addictive as it was when I first heard about a young fantasy hero who was disparagingly pegged as an ""American Harry Potter""

Oh, people. People, people, people...you cynics do a grave injustice to Percy Jackson.

Percy Jackson is in a class of his own.
------------

*HALF-BOY, HALF-GOD, ALL HERO*, the tagline says it all.

Percy Jackson is your quintessential preteen : restless and prone to falling into trouble with alarming regularity. Add to that, he is dyslexic and suffering from ADHD. Getting into dangerous scraps and being shuffled from school to school, he pretty much accepts the fact that he’s destined to be labeled as nothing more worthwhile than a 'troubled kid'.

Little does Percy know that he’s a Half-Blood/ Demigod, an offspring of a powerful Greek God and a mortal woman. And there is a special place called Camp Half-Blood which houses, trains and protects such demigods.

But everything is not peachy-keen in the celestial world. The Greek Gods are very much active in the western world, quibbling like normal siblings and ready to wage war at the drop of a toga. A powerful and potentially disastrous godly weapon has gone missing and unless it is recovered soon and handed over to its rightful owner, the Gods are willing to unleash their collective fury.

In a war that would destroy everything.

So newly discovered demigod, Percy has been given the dubious honor of retrieving the missing weapon. Accompanied by Annabeth Chase (a fellow demigod and daughter of Athena) and Grover Underwood (an environmental-friendly satyr with a deep and abiding passion for enchiladas and tin cans), Percy sets off on his first quest. Along the way he has to battle mythical monsters, vault over tricky situations and play reluctant peacemaker between his bickering relatives. The plot never loses its engaging pace and dangerous surprises spring up with alarming regularity.

Rick Riordan has dragged Greek Mythology out of the musty old shelves, shed the pedantic prose and given it a fresh and humorous angle. The Gods are delightful in their portrayals. Whether it's a fiery Hell's Angel Ares or a power-suited Zeus, you know....you just know....that the rest of the celestial starcast are going to get their very own, custom-made Rick Riordan makeover.

The true star is our humble hero, Percy Jackson. With every page, you find yourself ardently rooting for him, fervently praying that he doesn't get turned into a rodent for his impertinence and finally applauding him for his seemingly rash (but wise) decisions.

------------
True blue (or should that be sea-green?) fans of Percy Jackson don't need to convinced about the supreme awesomeness of the stellar son of the Sea God. You have been there, incinerated the smelly monsters and bought the t-shirts.

Me, I'm just content to take the scenic route through Olympus. Again."
43,44,5,I've been putting off reading this series for ages and I'm so glad I finally decided to pick it up! I fell in love with Rick Riordan's writing style from the very beginning and I'm already dying to read more. I was actually pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this story since it is a middle grade novel and I didn't have the highest expectations going in to it. Everything about the story was just perfect though and I particularly enjoyed that it was based around Greek mythology. I really can't say enough good things about this book but I'll leave it at that so I can dive right into book two in the series!
44,45,5,I HAVE FINALLY READ PERCY JACKSON AND IT WAS SO GOOD😭 ONTO THE NEXT
45,46,5,"Finished it in one sitting, this should give you an idea about how perfect it was :D"
46,47,5,the gods finally listened to us and gave us the tv show we've always needed
47,48,5,I was sad okay
48,49,5,"My reviews can also be found at Vicariously & Voraciously

Much to my friend’s amazement, I knew pretty much nothing about the Percy Jackson series before starting this book. I think I enjoyed it a lot more because I didn’t really know any of the little factoids that a lot of other people know, heck, I hardly even knew the synopsis before opening the book. I knew that my 11 year old nephew was reading the series, and that I wanted to read it with him. I really wish that I was his age reading the book for the first time. The thing about Percy Jackson that would probably make it so appealing to as young as a 5th grader is that they probably have a lot of recent education on Greek mythology in school. At least, I I learned about that stuff around the 4th or 5th grade, to be honest it was so long ago it mostly mashes together. Regardless, it should be taking a lot of information that they would be familiar with.

TLT tells the story about Percy Jackson a modern day kid who finds out that his dad is Poseidon (HA! I didn’t even know this going into the book, but apparently it’s in the synopsis so I don’t count this as a spoiler). There is trouble with the Greek gods as someone seems to have stolen Zeus’ lightning bolt. Someone, Percy to be precise, must find the lightning bolt before the wrath of the gods starts WWIII.

-Obviously, kids like to have stories where ordinary people find out they are destined for greater things. When we are young we like to let our imaginations get away with us (heck, I still do). TLT delivers what is familiar and makes it into something exciting. Throughout the book, I am reminded of familiar mythology as it is reincorporated into Percy’s quest.
The writing style in the book is so easy and flows well enough that any young reader will enjoy the book because it reads like someone telling a story. A story full of twists and turns and never a dull moment.

- There isn’t a lot of new world building as this is set in a modern day setting. However, Riordan does a spectacular job of modernizing the Greek gods into Western civilization.

-Percy really is such a lucky boy. I mean, yeah, his life leading up to his quest was pretty awful, however, he should pretty much be dead. There were so many opportunities where he could have easily died, the end. It really was right place & right time plus a little dash of help form his friends (and dad).

I’m not going to go too in depth into all the people and friends Percy meets. But I will say that I love how the gods are depicted in this story. They are supposed to be this revered being, but they’re just a bunch of selfish, snotty brats. It’s funny how entitled they are because of their power."
49,50,5,"ICH HABE ES GELIEBT! Es hat einfach so viel Spaß gemacht Percy, Annabeth und Grover auf ihrer Reise zu begleiten und vor allen Dingen neben dem schlechten Film endlich mal das Buch gelesen zu haben 😭 Dieses Jahr werd ich auf jeden Fall so viele Rick Riordan Bücher wie möglich durchsuchten!"
50,51,5,taking bets on how many times i'll reread this series before the tv show comes out :)
51,52,5,"I absolutely adore this book, I never would have read it however had I not seen the movie adaptation and can I say while the movie good, the book was absolutely brilliant! I love the whole camp Halfblood and the awesomely dangerous quests they undertake. This book has made Greek Mythology much more simpler to understand too. I never realized how much the Gods got their groove on, I mean seriously how many children do they need? Jeez!

Plus I think the Gods can be so self centered, I don't particularly like Hermes for instance. He obviously doesn't care one bit about any of his children. I love Percy. I guess some people can relate to him. Got a crap step dad, a dad that's never there, getting bullied, not fitting in, different.

This book gives out good vibes too. It teaches us that good can overcome evil and that no matter how we're different we always belong somewhere and whatever makes us different can be our strength. I enjoyed how fast paced this book is, usually books take forever getting to the point and before I know it my interest has disappeared and I the book finds itself discarded. This book is nothing like that, it gets straight to the point, something exciting happens in every chapter and has me gasping. I highly anticipated every page and hated the fact that with every page I read the closer I came to the end. I didn't want it to end.

So the book...

Percy Jackson lives with his mom and his step father. Percy hasn't had the best childhood, he's been kicked out of countless schools due to ADHD and he's got Dyslexia plus his dad left him and his mom when he was a baby. Right now he goes to Yancy Academy which is supposed to be for people with his 'needs' if you will. He has his first real best friend Grover who seems to have a disability with his legs which make him dependent on crutches.

One day Percy goes on a school trip to a Greek museum and is completely scared out of his wits when a teacher transforms into a Fury and accuses him of stealing 'The Lightning Bolt' before he is saved by Mr Brunner, who threatens the monster with bodily harm even though he's in a wheelchair.

Little does Percy know he's about to be thrown into a strange chaotic life where he finds out nothing is as he thought. He's a Demi-God, half-human half-God and he's also the son of one of the 'Big Three' which are Hades, Zeus and Poseidon.

Percy gets sent to camp Halfblood where there are other Demi-Gods where he meets Luke the son of Hermes and Annabeth daughter of Athena. Turns out Mr Brunner isn't a teacher at all, he's Chiron the famous Centaur of myth and Grover is a Satyr and his protector.

At an event Percy's father claims him and lets everyone know exactly whose son he is and 'The Lightning Bolt' he's been accused of stealing is none other than Zeus’s. Percy must embark on a quest to find the Lightning Bolt and prove his innocence or a war shall break free like none the world has witnessed before.

As he, Annabeth and Grover embark on this quest they are challenged with great dangers involving intoxicating flowers and a scary woman with a fetish of turning people into stone.

Percy will find out just how far betrayal can go and how deceitful the Gods can be in this thrilling story as a powerful Demi-God finding out exactly who he is.

I would recommend this book to anyone with even a slight interest in Greek Mythology. The chosen audience for this book I believe is for children and I would agree that children would adore the story. I rate this book 5 stars!"
52,53,5,I'M CRYING i can't believe they are going to adapt this into a Disney+ series!!!! I hope they do it justice!! I can't wait to see who they cast and how they recreate all the iconic moments
53,54,5,"Disclaimer: if you haven't read this book yet you don't know what books are made for.

It's extremely hard for me to write a review for this book bc it's the series that got me into reading. I remember finishing this for the first time (since then I have read this 8 times) and thinking ""wow, I want to feel like this all the time. Like I have a friend in a book I can reach out for whenever I feel down or simply want to have fun"", because this is what percy jackson is for. It's a book made to entertain you, to make you care for the characters and have fun going on adventures with them, and, most of all, it makes you feel at home. When I read this book, when I it, I feel at home.

Okay, enough of me being emotional and nostalgic. I know talking about how much I love this book won't make anyone want to read it, so I'll present you some reasons why you

• it's better than harry potter
• the writing style is easy and fun to people of all ages
• I imagine giving this book to my future book-hating children and converting them into our inked paper cult and it warms my heart
• SO !!! DIVERSE !!!
• okay so actually the first series is not that diverse but if you get to Heroes Of Olympus the diversity™ will punch you in the face :)))) and you'll thank the gods for rick riordan
• it might not be 100% faithful to the greek myths but it gives such a realistic take on it I actually learned a lot
• Percy is a sarcastic little shit and everybody loves him
• well except the gods but whatever
• Annabeth is also a smartass little shit but I love her so much
• the gods are little shits
• and the modern take on hold greek myths is the actual best
• I can't think of anything else to say but there is so much more


okay so this review is shit and I feel like I haven't convinced anyone but !!! this book changed my life sooo please go read it




thank u rick riordan for blessing us with the most amazing characters and world ever created

rtc when I finish rereading everything"
54,55,5,"Percy Jackson is another amazing character I found in this year. I loved the way he narrated everything in this book.

Percy Jackson is a troubled demigod. Wherever he goes, trouble goes with him. He has two friends: Annabeth and Grover.
Zeus' powerful weapon has been stolen. And there is a threat of World War III. Percy, with his friends, has to find Zeus' weapon to stop this war.

Pretty much I liked everything in this book. Especially the writing style. It's humorous in first person POV.
Action scenes in this book are vivid enough to be enjoyable. I loved them.
I loved the concept of Percy's sword. It's amazing!!

Despite everything I liked, I am feeling that I am not in the mood to start a HUGE series of twelve books (till now) like this. I should have checked this before.
Anyway, for now I am putting this series on hold. Maybe I will continue this series in near future.

57,58,5,"“If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself.”




5/5 Stars






I think by now everybody knows what the series is about, but even so I let you a little summary, for those who may not yet know it and may be interested in giving it a try.













is a great main character, in the beginning I thought he was a little rude and had this rebellious attitude but right away you know all his story and what he really is, you can understand his attitudes, he's very brave and I've found him adorable, I think he has been able to handle the circumstances in a very mature way for his age and making the right decisions. I really ended up loving Percy and I'm very excited to be able to witness his growth and learning through books. Besides, I love the relationship he has with his mother. It's very beautiful to see how he thinks about her and to see how they love each other. It was very beautiful for me.





Oh I love how strong, decisive and independent she is, you can easily see how much she knows about the myths and how much she admires the gods, I think she gives us that perspective of someone who has lived almost all her life with the knowledge of being a demigod in the camp and her experiences as much as Grover's have made to Percy more aware and alert about their decisions and the responsibility they carry. The friendship of Anna with Percy was growing very slowly and I've enjoyed to see how it was being built in the course of the book


is so incredible, I've adored him from the first moment, is a great friend and proves it on countless occasions and despite the fact that he has been given the care of Percy as a responsibility, as the plot goes by you can say that he would have done it anyway, he has a very pure, innocent and warm soul, I really want to know more about this character, I hope he continues being in all the books, otherwise I will miss him so much. Plus, I think Grover undoubtedly gives that fun touch even in the worst situations, which makes reading a lot lighter and easier to read.





, the journey of the characters to discover the truth and avoid war between the Gods is more than fascinating, we meet unique and magical places, a lot of super interesting mythological characters , You'll certainly feel like the danger is just around the corner for these three guys.





In fact, I still can't believe how many things have happened in one book!"

The last time I read Percy Jackson, I was 12 years old and didn’t speak a WORD of English. I liked the series enough to binge it in one weekend, but it wasn’t out of the ordinary for me. 8 years later, I reread it, and loved it enough to make it the first five stars of this new decade.



I was surprised to find myself loving this book as much as I did. I didn’t expect to love a 2006 MIDDLE GRADE more as an ADULT than as a CHILD. I’m out of the target audience and the time period, and yet, this book aged like fine fucking wine and here’s why:

The are well developed and entertaining. Their story is engaging and no matter your taste in people, I’m pretty sure you’ll find yourself rooting for them. Percy is a flawed chosen one, Annabeth is not an ‘I’m not like the other girls’ fake feminist, which is rare for 2006.



The journey that Percy goes through, character-wise is brilliantly explored in a way that doesn’t feel redundant or lectured. It was a steady growth, with a beautiful, mature conclusion.

The is skilfully paced, with enough action to keep the story engaging and binge-able not too much so that the characters can’t assert themselves and grow eventually.



The simplistic, childish at times, which works perfectly for the story, obviously.

I won't lie to you and tell you that Percy Jackson is a critical masterpiece, but something is to be respected about Rick Riordan; he can dumb down mature and complex concepts to children and adults looking for a good time alike, while not making it seem like a lecture.

In conclusion, Rick Riordan is an incredibly skilled writer, who can make the most out of every page in a simply digestible way. If you’re in a reading slump looking for a good time, Percy Jackson’s the guy for you."

62,63,5,"EDIT 11/01/17: So, apparently Percy Jackson is being turned into a musical (yeah, I don't know how to feel about that) and Rick Riordan posted a clip of the guy playing Percy on his instagram (still don't know how to feel about it) so, here's the link for anyone who hasn't seen it because I need to discuss it with people: https://instagram.com/p/BPGUNMLh88z/

“You shall go west, and face the god who has turned;
You shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned;
You shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend;
And you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end.""

I will never be ashamed that one of my favourite series of all times is technically categorised as a middle-grade series. I read this book for the first time almost exactly four years ago, did a re-read early last year and decided that I couldn't go without reading about Percy's adventures again. Especially after reading a few weeks ago.

Every time I read this book I pick up on things I didn't the first two times, small facts that make me laugh or make me smile. I just love reading about Grover, Annabeth and Percy, one of my favourite trios. They are beyond amusing in their dialogue and interactions. Though, at times, they do feel older than 12.

I'm not sure I have to summarise this plot because almost everyone knows what it is about, personally, though I think this quote from the book just about sums up everything:






I can understand why some people wouldn't enjoy this series. It is action packed however and I don't think there is a stand still moment that features throughout the book. The trio are always facing some kind of problem which puts them in a life or death situation that seems to lean more in the death situation than anything.

I also remain to stand by my belief that Sally Jackson and Annabeth Chase are my favourite characters in this entire world that Rick writes. I mean Poseidon calls Sally a queen and Percy compares Annabeth to a princess when he first sees her. Coincidence? I think not.

In conclusion, an re-read and I believe that I will never personally tire of this series."

Summary
The Lightning Thief is a light-hearted fantasy about a modern 12-year-old boy who learns that his true father is Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea. Percy sets out to become a hero by undertaking a quest across the United States to find the entrance to the Underworld and stop a war between the gods. The novel provides a high-interest, humorous introduction to the Greek myths. It works well if taught in conjunction with mythology, which is a core component of most English state curriculum frameworks. The novel can also be taught at any time after the introduction of Greek mythology, to draw on students’ prior experience as per standard three of the Standards for English Language Arts of the National Council of Teachers of English.


They were plenty of characters going in and out of this book. My favourite character by far was which isn’t a surprise as she’s one of the more loved characters by people. My least favourite was for spoilery reasons. The majority of characters in this book were fun and had an important part to play but I’ll be talking about some characters that I just couldn’t get enough of or just REALLY want to discuss.




Percy is the 12-year-old protagonist of the novel. Percy struggles with ADHD, dyslexia, and getting into trouble, so he’s been expelled every year since he started school. Because of this, at the start of the novel, the only bright spots in Percy’s life are his new friend Grover and his strong relationship with Mom; he feels like a failure in many other ways. This begins to change when, after a year of seeing and experiencing odd things, the Minotaur interrupts Mom and Percy’s trip to the coast and seems to kill her. Percy winds up at Camp Half-Blood and discovers that his ADHD and dyslexia aren’t problems like he thought they were; they’re normal for kids who are demigods, or the children of one Greek god and one mortal parent. Percy’s dad, whom he thought died, is the Greek god Poseidon, who later claims him. Because of Percy’s parentage, the centaur Chiron decides to send Percy on a quest. Along with Grover and Annabeth, a daughter of Athena, Percy journeys west from New York to retrieve Zeus’s stolen thunderbolt from Hades. Along the journey, Percy shows himself to be impulsive, overly-trusting, and occasionally rash. He discovers that he’s a skilled swordsman with Riptide, a sword that Poseidon left for him, and he begins to rethink his thoughts on Poseidon. While Percy continues to feel abandoned by Poseidon and to focus more on rescuing Mom from the Underworld, Percy gradually becomes more accepting of his dad.

Although Percy is just 12 years old, his character and personality really stick out in the book. From the beginning, when he warned us about the “dangers” of reading the book, you could tell he had a strong and witty character. Making Percy the main character of this book was a wise decision because even though Annabeth is my favourite character, Percy was the one “doing” things. This proves that the rest of this series is going to be a fun ride. Especially if Rick keeps Percy.


Grover is a young satyr tasked with looking out for Percy at Yancy Academy. Grover is in his early 20s, but he has the maturity level of a middle school student since satyrs only grow half as fast as humans do. He often wears a “rasta-style” cap to cover his horns when his curly hair isn’t enough, and while they’re at Yancy, Percy believes that Grover is a normal kid with a muscle disorder that prevents him from running. He later discovers that this is part of Grover’s disguise. Additionally, Grover must fit his cloven hooves into human shoes using Styrofoam and his shoes are liable to come off if he runs. Percy believes that Grover is a normal kid up until the Minotaur attacks and Grover reveals that he’s a mythical creature who’s been sent to protect Percy from monsters. Grover’s personality reflects Percy’s initial read on the kind of person Grover is: Grover is capable of being brave when he has to be, but he’s generally disinterested in conflict and considers himself a failure. This is because, five years before the novel begins, Grover’s first keeper assignment went horribly: he was assigned to protect Thalia, Zeus’s demigod daughter, but he failed to do so. He did manage to save Luke and Annabeth instead, but the Council of Cloven Elders failed Grover on his assignment anyway. Grover has to live with the guilt and the knowledge that he’s the reason Thalia is dead, even though Percy and Annabeth insist that Grover did the right thing. Grover agrees to go on Percy’s quest in part so that he can prove himself to the Council—he desperately wants to become a searcher so he can go look for the god Pan, and he must complete a keeper’s assignment first. However, Grover also goes because his friendship with Percy is genuine and strong. For much of the novel, Grover acts as a voice of reason and as someone who can interpret Percy’s conflicted emotions. He doesn’t always know exactly what’s going on, but he’s always more than ready to help his friends when they need it.

At first, I couldn’t stand this funny but annoying character. But as the book proceeds, he stole my heart. Like I’m sure he has done with so many of you guys! Who could hate a character with no sense of sarcasm but a whole lot of love, cuteness and humour? I honestly can’t see how anyone could dislike him.


Annabeth is one of Percy’s best friends and a daughter of the goddess Athena. Annabeth is blonde, Percy’s age, and has been at Camp Half-Blood since she was seven. Like many demigods, she struggles with feeling abandoned; she explains that Athena left her with her dad, a professor, but that her dad was uninterested in having children and his new wife hates Annabeth. Because of this, Annabeth chooses to stay at Camp Half-Blood year-round, though she does wear her dad’s class ring on her camp necklace. As a daughter of Athena, Annabeth is smart and bookish, but she also struggles to sit still, as most half-bloods do. She wants to be an architect and build monuments to the gods in the long term, but in the short term, she desperately wants to go on a quest and prove herself. Annabeth is upset when Poseidon turns out to be Percy’s father, as she believes that as Athena’s daughter, she must hold the same rivalries as her mom does (and therefore can’t be friends with Percy, as Athena and Poseidon are rivals). Over the course of the friends’ quest, however, Annabeth begins to reevaluate this and tamp down on some of her rude behaviour. She eventually pledges that if the gods go to war, she’ll fight with Percy and Grover, no matter what side her mom is on. A skilled strategist, Annabeth comes up with a variety of the trio’s plans.

As my favourite character, Annabeth was an amazing addition to this book. Not only is her personality marvellous but she also turns out to be very helpful. As the “brains” of the operation, we get an insight into how Annabeth views the world and the environment and we instantly love it. I’d say she’s one of the smartest people in Athena’s cabin but I’m only on the first book.


Percy’s mom is a beautiful woman with long brown hair and sparkling blue eyes. Her story is tragic: her parents died when she was little, the uncle who raised her was distant, and his death kept her from finishing high school or attending college. Mom had a brief fling with Percy’s dad, but they never got married—instead, she married Percy’s stepfather, Smelly Gabe, when Percy was little. Mom is extremely kind and generous, so Percy doesn’t understand why she puts up with Gabe, who’s cruel to her. Mom works in a candy shop and makes sure to bring home blue candy whenever possible as an inside joke between her and Percy. She adores Percy and never makes him feel bad for getting expelled. Early in the story, the Minotaur seemingly kills Mom in its attempt to kill Percy, but Percy later discovers that Mom is being held in the Underworld by the god Hades. Percy adores his mother above all else, so although he agrees to go on the quest to help Poseidon, he secretly hopes that he’ll be able to save Mom.




I loved her overall character but it annoyed me that she kept staying with smelly Gabe. Even if it was to cover up Percy’s scent, which she could do in other ways like by covering the scent of the house with perfume. But other than that, I adored her character and found her to be an amazing mother. She just really needs to get away from that awful smelly Gabe.


Mr. Brunner is Percy’s mentor. Mr. Brunner is first Percy’s Latin teacher at Yancy Academy. He’s in a wheelchair, owns a number of Greek battle replicas that he uses for study games, and takes a special interest in Percy that Percy doesn’t quite understand. However, Mr. Brunner is the only teacher whom Percy cares about impressing. Once Percy ends up at Camp Half-Blood, he discovers that Mr. Brunner was just a disguise—Mr. Brunner is actually Chiron, the mythical centaur who trained classical Greek heroes like Theseus and Hercules. When in his Mr. Brunner form, which he often takes so he fits in buildings, Chiron’s horse body folds up into the wheelchair. Chiron is calm and kind, but he’s also exacting and he demands a high level of performance from his mentees. He also seems to know more than he lets on; Percy suspects that Chiron has heard a prophecy from the Oracle that mentions him, Annabeth, and Kronos, but Chiron is forbidden from talking explicitly about it. Instead, he contents himself with doing what he can to prepare Percy for his quest, including bypassing on Poseidon’s sword, Riptide. Chiron is unable to provide assistance during Percy’s quest, but he helps Percy interpret events after his return.




From the very beginning, Percy found Mr. Brunner calming and his favourite teacher. I loved Chiron’s character and was even better when I found out that Chiron was from camp half-blood. He has the duty of the old-wise-mentor and he did an amazing job. I can’t wait to learn and see him more around the book!


I really enjoyed this book and I’m so glad I finally picked it up! Thank you to all those who recommended it to me or encouraged me to finally pick it up. I can’t wait to continue on with this series and other Rick Riordon books. Overall this was an amazing introduction to what I hope and expect to be, an amazing series.

-Review of the last read:

""I didn't want to be a half-blood""

Best series ever!
You should definitely read this book! It really is worth the hype!



Percy Jackson is a young 'troubled' teenager who has been in 6 different school in six years. As he gets kicked out of his school - again -, he is embarked to a new place called Camp Half-Blood, a secret camp which is for people like him. Hyperactive and aggitated but also, demigods: half gods, half mortals. Quickly after his arrival, he discovers his long lost dad is in fact Poseidon, god of the sea, and goes on a quest with two friends to retrieve Zeus' stolen master bolt.
Along the adventure, the trio will face challenges that will require quick-thinking and courage but most importantly, an united front. Monsters and gods are chasing them and they only have 10 days to face the Lord of the Dead, retrieve what has been stolen and see it safely returned.



Born with ADHD and dyslexia, life hasn't been easy for Percy who seems to be a magnet for problems. When he gets to Half-Blood Hill, he finally finds a family that welcomes him with open arms but unfortunately, not everyone is who they seem to be. Along his quest, he will face threat after threat but never back down from a challenge and will prove himself a true hero.

At age 7, she ran away from home, understanding she wasn't wanted where she lived. Along her way alone, she met Luke and Thalia who took her under their wing and were soon joined by Grover who led them to the camp. There, she trained and trained for years, hoping to get a quest someday. And then, 'Seaweed Brain' came and she was thrust into the real world to retrieve a stolen object. For the first time, she has a way of proving her worth and isn't about to let it go.

As a satyr, Grover went undercover to a few different schools to try and spot a demigod. And he spotted Percy. They quickly became friends and he was embarked in the dangerous quest with him. It was his chance, to prove he had the courage to become a 'searcher' and find the long lost god Pan.



This is, without protest, the first book of the best series of all times. Written by Rick Riordan, the myth master, it'll grab you in its pages and you won't be able to put it down.
If you're asking yourself, it IS worth the hype and you should definitely read it! Or at least try it out :)


Thank You.

-Review of the second read

What can I say?!
This book is absolutely fantastic!

Basically, it's the story of a young boy named Percy who discovers he is a halfblood (half mortal, half god) but that's just the beginning. He'll have to go on a dangerous quest to save the world from getting into a huge world war...
During this quest he will: fight a god, make hard decisions, destroy monuments, cross the US as a runaway and much more!
You can't be prepared to what is coming for you in this book!

You're still wondering if you should read it? Well, here are a few reasons to:
- has humour, adventure, action and more
- has amazing and attaching characters
- teaches you greek mythology
- is for all ages and type of people
- has been absolutely loved by many many people
- is written by Rick Riordan (:D)

What are you waiting for to read it? (;D)
It really is worth it! Clearly the first book of one of my favorite series EVER!

Happy reading ;)"
66,67,5,"Reread: January 2019 💞 First read: October 2013

I read this at the best possible time in my life. This series is so nostalgic for me and such a huge part of my childhood. My absolute favourite series of all time, hands down!

I read this book in the fifth grade and it was so impactful! I ended up reading all the nine books in two months, and then I bought the tenth novel the exact day it came out a year later. This was the series that prompted me to reach for more novels, and to branch into more middle grade/YA. I absolutely love Greek mythology, so it’s not surprising that this series is one of my favourites of all time. I love the humour, the characters, the plot, the whole works. I’ve made my sister read the series, and I’m currently forcing my friend to read the series because I love it so much!

This series has such a special place in my heart and it always will❤️"
67,68,5,"Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood.

And so starts a saga of five, ten, coming up on twelve, arguably 20+ books that have changed my life for the better. I can't believe I don't have a review for this book, so I'm going to write one, and it's going to be immensely personal, because a) I love oversharing on the Internet and b) Percy's story and how it fits in with my own is permanently intertwined in my head and c) Percy Jackson has not only saved the lives and happiness of myself, but of thousands of other kids who share similar stories like mine.

I picked up Percy Jackson in the sixth grade and it carried over to the seventh, which was important, because I was in a new school with no friends. I've never been good at making friends. When I was a kid, I went the first year in school without any friends, and even then, I wasn't friends with the people who mattered. I was also a bit of a menace in elementary school. I didn't do my homework, and despite the fact that I was shy, I was seen as just as much of a troublemaker as the disruptive and loud boys.

Guess what? In seventh grade, my teachers got concerned and pulled me aside to see a clinical psychologist. I was failing and I had no friends. I was diagnosed with ADHD and Asperger's syndrome, which explained a lot of my school problems. I probably would have been devastated about the diagnosis if it wasn't for Percy being there by my side. I already felt stupid enough, but with Percy, it had already been drilled into my brain that ADHD made you different, not stupid.

Seventh grade was also a disaster that mirrored Percy's sixth-grade life for a lot of reasons. I got picked on in this weird-passive aggressive manner. I was a weird kid. Percy was really my only friend in that school. I daydreamed about him in class with me. I got pulled over by the teachers a lot. My French teacher, Mrs. Nicol (like Percy's English teacher Mr. Nicoll), called me lazy constantly. Like Mrs. Dodds, my math teacher wore a leather jacket and I got locked in her classroom for detention a lot. Once, my locker partner's books had fallen on my head and knocked me over, and I was so frustrated with my experience in that school I didn't pick them up. While I was gone someone had dumped them into the garbage and I was blamed for it and thrown into detention with the principal. All I could think:

That year was a slow crawl towards the end, and I wouldn't have gotten through it without Percy. I wouldn't have gotten through anything without Percy. [cw: suicidal thoughts]
Not to be dumb or cliche, but Rick Riordan's books have literally saved my life, more than any other piece of media has.

Plus, it's a good premise and a good plot - not the best, admittedly, but it's such a blast that you can excuse the parts that aren't top-notch writing or plotting. I learned so much about Greek mythology that I would not have known had I not read Percy Jackson. The characters are absolutely iconic and I love every last one of them, except for Smelly Gabe, who deserves everything he got. may not be the best book of the series, or my favourite, but I love it to death: my reading copy (one out of five) is ragged and held together by tape from the amount of times I've read it. This past reading, it ripped in half. Percy Jackson is so genuine and moral and such a good kid and I love him. He's also angry a lot - at the gods, at teachers, at Smelly Gabe, because he's gone through a lot of shit in his life already (and will continue to go through even more, give him a break, please). He's insecure about a lot of things and feels responsible for protecting everyone he cares about, which is a lot of burden on a twelve-year-old, but it his fatal flaw. His narration is hysterical - he's sarcastic, and a lot of the time it's not out loud, but quips he holds back because he knows it would get him incinerated, but his smart mouth does get the best of him. And the chapter titles are one of my favourite parts of Riordan books. He has the best chapter titles in YA lit, hands down. Percy's one of the most developed, well-written, and three-dimensional characters I've seen. There's so much to him.

Annabeth is the smart girl who most readers might identify with, because she reads a lot and she's book-smart, unlike Percy (who is smart ... just not book-smart). I definitely feel a lot like Annabeth more these days as I've gotten my shit together and my grades up. She's dedicated and determined and fiercely intelligent, yet she still struggles with ADHD and dyslexia like most demigods, and I admire her more than I can put into words. Grover Underwood, Percy's best friend, is incredible and brave in his own way. He's endearing and funny and I love him so much. There's a lot of other characters I love (cough: Nico di Angelo, Reyna Ramirez-Arellano) but the original trio will always have a special place in my heart. Sally Jackson - gods. She deserves the world. Book mom of the year. All of the characters are so developed and feel so real.

This first novel sets the tone for the rest of the series as kind of silly, but serious too, and it's a good mix of both. You get moral discussions: does Percy have the right to send someone, even if it's his abuser, to the Fields of Punishment? What do people see in the afterlife? It can get dark, since they're literally trekking to hell, but it's never dismal or hopeless and Percy always breaks up anything too dark with a joke about, say, Hades's underwear. His sarcastic narration also brings out the laughs. Rick Riordan likes his pop culture references, so the book does feel a bit dated (does any kid these days even know who Hillary Duff is?), and his newer books (which are chock-full with contemporary pop culture) will feel even more dated as they age. Rick Riordan's style is juvenile, but gosh, it's a middle grade book, and even as an adult and an English major, I think it's incredibly well-written for kids and adults, and it's just as enjoyable to me now as it was when I was 12.

There's a lot of other things I like about this book and this series, but I could go on, and on, and on. Thank you, Percy Jackson and Rick Riordan, for making seventh-grade me feel like I could be a hero.

Also, I think you should know: there's a , and it's , I hear. I know some of y'all who don't like musicals might doubt this - and the adult actors don't help - but believe me, it's a thousand times more accurate than the movie ever was. The actors are adults 12-year-olds (because, well, theatre), so they're still twelve. The first line Percy sings is ""Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood,"" and the last is ""I'll be back next summer,"" which are verbatim from the book - his first line and his last spoken line. There are references to the rest of the series - Nico and Bianca appear in the Lotus Casino. The writers were fans of the book, and got Rick Riordan's permission. The cast album is coming out on June 30. Please support it."

This book was amazing, I mean AMAZING! The mythology aspect is mind blowing, and the characters are all so unique and are truly irreplaceable. The plot is very thought out, as well as the world.

The movie is nothing compared to the book, except for the cast, which is pretty great.

The other characters like Annabeth and Grover are pretty cool as well, I enjoyed reading this book and I can't wait to read the next book!"

This book is indeed for a younger audience, but I'm so happy that I reread it as a 23-year-old because I picked up on so many things that I didn't appreciate 5 years ago. For example, I was surprised that Rick Riordan briefly explored mature themes like domestic abuse, sexism, and even colonialism/Orientalism. I'll go into detail in my complete review, but believe me when I say that Percy Jackson is also perfect for adult readers. <3

P.S. I already ship Percy and Annabeth despite their ages. The movie makes them look much older though. :p"

The Percy Jackson series had been sitting on my shelf for a number of years. And, I'd not pick them up until this month. I don't know what inspired or pushed me into reading the series I'd not been eying all this time. What I know is that I'm not putting the series unfinished. Yes, I'm so into it.

Before I begin, to talk about how and why I liked , I'd like to make this clear that I haven't watched the movie adaption. Also, I do not plan on doing so. However, I'm really looking forward to the TV adaptation of the same. No particular reasons for such unjust biasness. I guess I prefer the book to TV adaptations more when compared to book to movie adaptations.

Beginning with Greek Mythology. I have not read any Greek Mythology stuff (please don't kill me). Wow! Such bold confessions. But yes, I loved reading everything about Greek Mythology in the book. Which really inspired me to read more of Greek Mythology books/Greek Mythology inspired books. Thanks, Rick Riordan for doing so.

I absolutely loved camp Halfblood. Rick Riordan outdid himself in writing the camp.

The story is fast-paced which makes you want to read more and more of it.

About Percy, what can I say? As I kept on turning the pages, I adored him more and more. I so want to know him in the later installments. He's the kind of kid you can't help sympathizing with. Apart from the MC, I loved reading about Annabeth the most.

The book had so many similarities to the Harry Potter series. I can't say about the later books in the series. Reading definitely gave me some of the Harry Potter feels. For instance, reading about Percy reminded me of Harry, Annabeth of Hermione, Chiron of Dumbledore, Kronos of Voldemort, etc.

Why do I want to go on with the series despite the analogy? Because it was super fun. The fact that it's kind of a Harry Potter rip-off makes me, even more, want to read it. I can't wait to read the second installment in the series.

If you like the Harry Potter series, you should definitely read the Percy Jackson series."
76,77,5,"How. In the world. Is it possible. That I never read this book. Before today.
Okay so, this was great. I really have no other words to describe this: it was great. I understand why this series is so well-known and well-loved, and I am so glad I bought all the books so now I get to read all of them! I never want to stop!! I just couldn't put this down, it was just so easy to read and read and never stop. This is exactly everything I want from a middle grade fantasy! This guy is a genius!!! Love it, love it, love it."
77,78,5,"Update (9/16/19)(3rd time reading the novel): I loved seeing Percy at the start of his journey again. It is a little info dumpy at the beginning, but I still enjoy this story a whole lot.

I just love this world and all of the small Greek myth references that you only get if you know a lot about mythology. So great. I'm going to continue to reread the series as Torin reads them for the first time."

Though the plot has a lot of similarities to , I'd say it's still a good book. Most people will rate it one star, calling it 'plagiarism.' But I don't think so. Let me ask you, how many people can take up Greek mythology and weave a story around it? One so satisfying? The answer is, not many. But did it. I respect him for that.

The plot did have a few plot holes but which literary piece comes without flaws? I also found the fact that monsters appearing everywhere seemed a bit stuffed in like it didn't fit.


Did I ever mention I love the name Long Island Sound? Or that Camp Half-Blood suits perfectly. Did I also ever mention how much I love where everything is situated? Nope? WHAT WAS I THINKING?!

The worldbuilding is amazing!


Characters?
Yes.

WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THEM?
Well, to be honest, they were-
TO THE POINT!
the worst part of this book
*freezes* W-why?
Well,

they were okay. But still at the bottom of the list. A few characters like Grover and Annabeth had a really good personality. And some, like Percy, the best character arcs. Others had small personalities, just enough not to make me want to slap them.

But even after the disappointment of the characters, this gets a five star."

Funny and sarcastic, Percy has to be one of the best book narrators. All his life, strange things have happened to Percy. He sees things others don't- things like your teacher turning into a monster, him killing it with a pen that changes into a sword and then absolutely no one remembering about that teacher. Everyone behaves as if the teacher never even existed.

Until one fine summer, when he realises that he is the child of God. No! No!! Not in the we-all-are-children-of-God bs way but in the Percy-is-the-offspring-of-an-Olympian-God way. Percy Jackson is a half blood, a Demigod- the son of a mortal woman and an Olympian God.

But is being the son of God, with supernatural powers really that cool? All half bloods live in the Camp Half Blood for in the real world, monsters are after their lives. Also, the Greek Gods aren't known for their virtuousness, not even towards their own family. And who exactly is Percy's dad? Some Gods don't even bother claiming their own children, will Percy too be lost like those unfortunate ones?

Oh! You thought these problems were too much? Lololol
Zeus himself accuses Percy to the Lightening thief and hell hath no fury like an Olympian scorned.

But despite all this, Camp Half Blood is where Percy feels home for the first time. A pretty intelligent girl with golden curls, Annabeth Chase, daughter to Athena, enters his life and what's this weird, new feeling👀🤔
Intelligent, brave, wise, quick on foot, Annabeth is love!
He also meets a goat boy, a satyr, Grover and goat or not he's Percy's best friend. Together they're a pretty young tho formidable trio.

Won't you join our 12 year old Demigod, with his 12 year old friends, in his quest, failing which might start a celestial war?

First Read: 4th August 2015
Re-Read: September 20th 2018

It was good that i decided to to a re-read of this series, i finished this series back in 2015 and i wanted to re-read it again.. i still got that same feeling i did when i read it 3 years ago. it was funny, action packed, amazing characters and an impressive storyline!

I honestly cannot believe it has taken me three years to finally buy and read this book I've been telling myself i'd read it and now i finally have i can honestly say it was worth the wait.

the whole entire concept of the book is just fascinating, fun and interesting. Having a camp full of kids that all decedents of greek gods its just a crazy thought. I would love to go to camp Half-blood for a summer because the world that Rick Riordan created has set my imagination into over drive.

i cannot find any negatives on this series, great story-telling, the characters were all good to read i can't wait to get started and finish the rest of the series"

The Lightning Thief is a quick, fun story involving Percy, a confused teenage boy, who does not fit in no matter which boarding school he attends. His mother loves him dearly, but Percy despises his step-dad, who treats him like crap. And don’t even mention his “real” father, because he has few memories of that stranger. Due to all this, our dark-haired and green eyed boy has attitude problems, learning problems, and family problems. Of course, Percy tries to hide all his insecurities and anger behind a tough facade and mostly lame jokes. But deep down, our troubled youngster is seeking for some meaning to his problematic life. Something that explains exactly who he is and why he feels lost inside.





Almost immediately, Percy stumbles upon the fact that he is not a mere mortal at all! Turns out he is a half-blood: a child born from the union of a mortal and a god. No wonder, he has felt like he did not belong in the modern world. It also explains why his “real” father has never been around, because his dad is a member of the ancient Greek pantheon. Those guys still exist, and most of them still live on Mount Olympus, which is suspended above New York City.

I said New York City! Because you see, the Greek gods are not really the gods of ancient Greece at all but of western civilization itself. So as the center of the western world has shifted through the ages, the Greek gods have migrated with it through numerous countries until they found themselves centered in the good, old U.S. of A..





Once Percy discovers his godly heritage, his life is in grave danger . . . from otherworldly monsters! Thankfully, our teenage hero finds allies to help him escape his pursuers and reach sanctuary. The trip is fraught with danger, monsters and fighting. Percy comes through it all however, discovering otherworldly abilities within that he doesn’t understand and that surprises those at camp. Yeah, the safe haven Percy has been through hell to get through is Camp Half-Blood: a summer camp for the god’s kids.

At camp, Percy goes through the normal juvenile process of fitting in; some of the other half-bloods like him and some do not, i.e., there is a bully who instantly hates him. He meets ancient, powerful individuals from Greek mythology, lives in a house with the other campers, participates in camp “activities,”drinks from self-filling cups, and realizes that he might have some shadow destiny to fulfill. His mentors even try to train him to fight with ancient weaponry. () Percy naturally shows uncanny abilities, is gifted with a wondrous weapon of power, finds himself on a quest that he is not prepared for but which he must undertake to save the world from certain destruction, and finally finds



Despite all my stupid jokes about , I honestly did enjoy reading it. The Olympian mythology kept things interesting; the writing was fast-paced and enjoyable; the characters were fun; and Percy - though dense as hell at times - was an interesting protagonist. So for all those reasons, give this one a try; it is actually a decent young adult novel."

⤷ Percy Jackson is a young boy growing up in Manhattan, he goes to a boarding school called Yancy Academy. He struggles with ADHD and Dyslexia and has therefore changed schools once a year since he started school, due to ‘incidents’ (which aren't his fault, ofc). One day, Percy and his class are on a fieldtrip at some museum I can’t remember the name of and shit. goes. down. The ‘shit’ mentioned leads to Percy being expelled from school, and he goes home for the summer. More shit goes down, and he ends up running from a minotaur and eventually kills it (😎). Percy ends up getting to the safe harbor of CHB, where he meets a certain 'pretty girl, with blonde hair curled like a princess'. Less importantly, it's where he’s told that he’s a half-blood (and finds out his teacher is half horse, but that’s beside the point). Percy is experiencing the five stages of shock, but he is eventually claimed by Poseidon (😎) and once again, shit. goes. down. Percy ends up being framed for a crime he didn’t commit, but he is sent on a quest to fix it nonetheless. Percy, Annabeth and Grover travel from Manhattan to Los Angeles, encountering dangers (and a pink poodle??) along the way. Once again, shit goes down (DUHN DUHN DUUUUUUHN) and Percy ends up battling a god (and he wins😎) and the three kiddos save the day🥳🥳 (atleast until the gods decide they want to be useless babies again)

89,90,5,finished another reread of this. pjo still has my heart after almost 8 years. ily chb
90,91,5,"Oh my goodness. This book. If this is how this series starts, then I'm in for a hell of a rollercoaster~

I LOVED this book it was mixed with just the right amount of action and mystery and all of the character's where just so well developed and I instantly fell in love with some of them. The plot twists that came along the way really left me open-mouthed and I SHOULD'VE seen it from a mile away, but Rick Riordan writes so perfectly perfect that I didn't!

I also love the concept of the prophecy that he incorporated into the story and how it unfolds and how it's not what you had initially thought it would be. I think prophecy's on their own are enticing and you never know what to expect from them. This book is sort of like that, I plunged into this world not knowing what it was about (only hearing bits and pieces from die-hard fans) and I am SO glad I finally joined the fanwagon because this series is AMAZING I TELL YOU.

I hateeee Luke. I mean, no. I hate the feelings that have been harbored inside of Luke. If Hermes would've been more appreciative and... ugh just don't even get me started. And also, the incorporation of Greek mythology and how Riordan used it to his own accord but still following pretty precisely was just breathtaking. I was never all that interested in Greek mythology and their gods and what each one did, but with this book I feel like a new world has been opened up to me. I find myself wanting to know more of every god mentioned in this book and all those myths they mentioned I found myself delving into their meaning, and I love books that make me think and reflect on their deeper meaning and what not.

SO OVERALL, this book... just wow. 5 stars for Rick Riordan and then 5 more for the storyline and then 5 more for the characters and then 5 more because it's just so UTTERLY AMAZING

The writing in this book was flawless. I loved Percy's narration. His dry humor, his cool sarcasm; everything that came out of his mouth was entertaining. He definitely is a cool kid for a 12 year old. He made jokes even in the most pressing circumstances which made the whole vibe of the book cheery.


Uncle Rick sure knows how to carve his characters. All of them had their own good or bad things. They all were very different from each other. They were unique in their own way and that is what made them so perfect.
I am sure almost everyone knows at this point that he is a demi-god. He is sired by one of the three most powerful Olympian god and that made him somewhat different from other half-bloods. He is dyslexic and has ADHD. He is such an adorable cute kid. His sarcasm is a little out of the hand. I mean I kept on thinking how was I like when I was 12. Definitely a goof but the point is Percy isn't cool among his peers which I found really startling because well he is a . How can he not be cool. :/ Anyway the thing is his character undergo a lot of development throughout the book. He became more and more confident as the story progressed. Can't wait to him grow up!

Oh my precious! She is like a bright sunshine on a dark cloud. Annabeth is how writers should portray YA heroine. She is smart and kind and very badass without being bitchy. Her character proves that most of the times a conflict can be solved by a mere use of a brain. She is like my new spirit animal.

My darling goat! I love his loyalty and friendship. His quirks were so entertaining. He eats cans of diet coke and if it isn't make your heart melt nothing would. LOL



I plot was solid enough. There was action and adventure and enough twists to keep you on toes. I love Greek mythology and loved to read about small things about greek gods in this. One thing that I especially liked about this book is that there isn't troupe here. I mean Percy is kind of special but not really. He is a demigod but so are the rest of the students in the camp. He isn't special and it made him special.




The only thing the book lacked was a strong female-female friendship. I felt like there should be someone in half-blood camp who portrays strong female character. Now that I think about it there weren't many female students in half-blood camp. But I hope there would be in the next books."
97,98,5,"“If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself.”


If I want my child to be reading anything when they are still young and innocent, I'll try giving them books such as this one. Certainly, not shitty, erotica books because I don't want my child to lose its virginity by the time they are 13, yup, no thanks.

This book is so adventurous, it makes me teary just thinking about what an amazing experience it was. I didn't want this to end. Was it Rick Riordan's captiving prose and never-boring characters that kept me so interested? Or was it the amazing storyline and how this world was so smartly crafted?

I can re-read this anytime which I think is what every author wants to accomplish when their readers are reading a book of theirs? If I was an author, I'd just want my readers to be filled with emotions such as joy and satisfaction after reading my books. This book accomplished that one thing.

The characters are so endlessly smart, they are smart-alecks to be honest. They are all so young and I just can't help thinking about their inteligence and cunning that they so early started showing.






A true fantasy book with great touches of adventure and action. <3"
98,99,5,"I really loved this book. I think it’s geared for 8-12 year olds but this is one of those books that the more you know about the world the more you like it. The premise is wonderful and very creative. The characters, especially the hero Percy, are very likeable. There’s so much humor, popping up at places where I least expected it and I absolutely enjoyed all of it.

The story was predictable and one of the main surprises/mysteries wasn’t one for me, but it didn’t really matter. In fact, it was fun to be ahead of the hero in at least one way.

Percy, the main character hero, has dyslexia and ADHD, and the explanation given for these conditions could make this a beloved book for kids who also have dyslexia, ADHD, and any other learning or behavioral challenge.

However, unlike the first Harry Potter book (this is also the first book in a series) I didn’t envy the hero’s position one little bit. That didn’t stop me from enjoying his situation as a spectator.

This book could inspire children to learn more about mythology and it is a good introduction to some of the mythological gods and other beings and their stories, but readers might enjoy this book more if they’d had some basic education in ancient Greek mythology."
99,100,5,"32° Libro finito. Mi piace come scrive Riordan. Capitoli corti, concisi e di facile lettura. E poi ho adorato i titoli. Sembra strano da dire ma ogni volta che ne leggevo uno mi chiedevo ora che cavolo succederà? 😅
Il secondo è nel carrello di Amazon. Probabilmente farò l'ordine verso Luglio.

PS: Dimenticavo che è stato un ottima lezione sugli dei greci. Mi ha ricordato il mio folle amore per il cartone della Disney di Hercules e un po' Pollon. E per ultimo mi ha fatto perdonare Jpop per la traduzione in Estia (letteralmente è scritto come Hestia [ヘスティア] una volta convertito il katakana) senza H. Se due case editrici usano lo stesso nome, anche in inglese c'è la H, vuol dire che in fondo è giusto. Quando un libro aiuta l'altro."
100,101,5,"I'm a Teen Services Librarian, and one of my favorite teen patrons has been nagging me for _years_ to read this book. But, despite my long-standing fascinating with Greek mythology, I just couldn't be bothered. Then one Thursday afternoon at a library program, while I was sneaking looks at ""The Last Olympian"" (the fifth and final book in the Percy Jackson series), which she had on top of her stack of books (it just looked really _cool_), she finally ran upstairs to the teen section and came back to hand me ""The Lightning Thief.""

It's actually the second time she thrust the book directly into my hands with orders to read it, but this time, on a middle-school-lit high from ""Bloody Jack"" (and _desperate_ to read anything to prolong the forced re-read of ""Twilight"" that I'm attempting), I finally checked it out and actually opened it several days later.

And I am in LOVE.

In some ways, I shouldn't be, because in some ways, much of this is old ground. Indeed, in quite a few surface ways, they just should have saved time and called the first book, 'Harry Potter and the Greek Myths.' ""Oh, here's the part where Not!Harry finds out he's a not!wizard and goes off to not!Hogwarts with the plucky-comic relief friend Not!Ron! Ooh, and now we meet too-smart-for-her-own-good Not!Hermione! Oh, and this is the part where the Not!Slytherins with their Not!House banner come along to compete for the Not!House Cup! Oh, ha, and now Percy's finding out that he's really good at Not!Quidditch, which really surprises him because it's the only thing he's ever really been good at!""

This isn't necessarily a slam against Riordian's originality -- I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he's never actually read the Potter series; it's just that this is how these stories _work_. But still, the similarities makes the book obviously Potter-esque -- and, due to the heavy-handed foreshadowing (he only got me with ONE plot twist) and simpler structure, makes ""The Lightning Thief"" just slightly less good that the Rowling series.

On the other hand, ""The Lightning Thief"" is also funny (HYSTERICALLY funny), clever, wry, action-packed, character-rich, full of brilliant Greek myth in-jokes, and moving enough that the St. Louis big-battle scene had me in tears. For being a post-Potter children's fantasy series, it's remarkably fresh, because it takes the standards of the children's fantasy Hero's Journey, blends together some outrageously awesome Greek myth, and produces something really special.

It also has some Christian allegory that, intended or not, really struck a chord with me.

It did some things amazingly right, which I'd like to keep in mind (read no further if you don't want spoilers);

- When Hades accuses Percy of stealing Zeus's thunderbolt, Annabeth and Grover don't wonder for even an if Percy was actually the thief. They totally trust him by that point and so it doesn't even enter their heads that Hades could be right and Percy might actually have stolen it -- which made me very happy. The main character being accused of something they didn't do, and having their friends fail to believe their innocence, is a common trope of the genre and something that drives me absolutely , and I was really glad not to see it here.

- Percy chooses not to use one of the pearls to save his mum. I love that. Any decent parent would get really angry at you if you destroyed the world just to save them. Wouldn't go over well, if your parents are any type of decent, after all. This is one of the key reasons I love Percy so much (aside from his sense of humor) -- while he does have a definite streak of rashness, he also has the occasional ability to think things through. Harry Potter develops this ability eventually, but at the moment, Early-Series Percy is definitely sharper than Early-Series Harry.

- Maybe he'll end up a bad guy later, but for right now, Hades isn't evil, just very unpleasant, and I appreciate that (because in the original myths, he's *not* supposed to be evil, just unpleasant). Also his sudden temper tantrum about the rising costs of running the Underworld is fabulous.

- Because his mum has to do it . I actually did an AIR PUNCH, a real actual air punch, when I read that part. In a world of Edward Cullen swooners, here is a female character who realizes, in situations such as these, ya gotta save *yourself*. It's a gorgeous moment of truth, and I applaud Riordan for giving a parent, a *mother* (who would normally be dead in these sorts of stories), that moment.

- Percy goes home for the year. I love the line, ""The real world is where the monsters are. That's where you learn whether you're any good or not."" I read this book while I was going through a semi-difficult time in my life, and this line managed to make me tear up, make me love Annabeth, and inspire me all at the same time.

- I really did think that Chiron was going to be the friend who betrays Percy (I don't know why I was so sure about this, unless it is because I am still bitter about what they did to the Dumbledore-Gandalf-ObiWan-Chiron-type character in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" and so it's got me suspicious of *all* mentor characters now) ... so I cannot tell you how happy I was to be wrong. Not that I was happy it was Luke -- I really liked Luke -- but it made sense and fit the character and it wasn't Chiron and so it was all quite cool.

... the whole book was quite cool. I can't say enough good things about it. An awesome, awesome read.


""Do you know how few people have gone to the Underworld and escaped? Not many. Hercules. Orpheus. Houdini."""
101,102,5,AMAZING! INCREDIBLE! WONDERFUL! UNBELIEVABLE! I need more words but I don't have them!!!! I can't believe how fantastic this book was. Percy has such a strong and powerful mind that this book just fell right into place. I was consistently at the edge of my seat knowing that every page would start something new and even more exciting than the last. Such a spectacular read that I recommend to EVERYONE!!! And Annabeth. OMG I want to die over her. She has an uplifting mind that spirit and she's so smart and adventurous and it blows me away how much a 12 year old girl can be the difference of Percy living or dying. She reminds me of Hermione from HP haha. Grover seems like that best friend that will do anything and everything to keep you satisfied. I fell in love with Rick Riordans style of writing and I cant wait to read the next books in the series!!

Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief is nothing short of an epic coming of age story enveloped into the world of Greek Mythology. Though these books are targeted for a younger audience, they are laced with great humour, adventure, self-discovery, and most importantly likeable/unlikable characters.

Now, this is not my first time reading this book, let alone this series, but it is the first time I have ever made a review for it. It's not the easiest thing to necessarily make a review for, simply because I am currently a 22 year adult, reading a series that is targeted for 9-12 readers. However, that could never stop me from loving absolutely everything about this book and series as a whole. They bring such comfort and enjoyment as I delve into the little world that Rick Riordan has created.

I do have a lot of thoughts about what makes this such a good read and why I love this series, is it perfect? No, but it does have a lot of great twists and turns, with an unsettling prophecy."

104,105,5,"The Lightening Thief is one of the most fun books I’ve ever read. It is full of adventure, jokes, lovable characters, Greek mythology and (my fave) lots of sass/sarcasm. Basically, it has everything that I could ever wish for.

First of all I just want to acknowledge that I first read this book back in 2010 when the movie came out (yeah I’m that kid who read the book because of the movie, not sorry about it though), and so I was a bit worried that seven years later I might not enjoy it as much as I did the first time around. Thankfully that was not the case, obviously I read this a long time ago so I can’t really remember how much I loved it, but I think I may have even loved it more this time around. This story just as so much to offer it’s readers!!! And I know that there is so much I didn’t appreciate the first time, because I don’t think I was even aware of all that it had to offer me. I feel like this is one of those series that continues to get better every time you reread it.

This story is pretty straight forward. We have Percy, who believes himself to be a below-average kid who has a life that is pretty sucky, only to find out that he is actually the son of one of the big three Greek Gods and that both he and his life are far more exciting and important than he could have ever imagined. Percy goes to camp-half blood, where he meets other demigods (children of greek gods/goddesses and humans) and is almost instantly set out on a quest to save the world.
Percy is joined by Annabeth (MY GIRL) and Grover, and the plot in it’s most basic form is your typical heroes journey), but thankfully the characters, the setting, and the tone of this book keep the story feeling fun and new. The writing is fast paced, witty, and very easy to follow. This story is very clearly aimed for younger readers, but like I mentioned earlier it has a lot to offer, so don’t let that keep you away.

Percy is the kind of character who questions the legitimacy of everything happening around him, despite the fact that he accepts his new life style he doesn’t necessarily understand it all which provides lots of opportunity for things to be explained both to him and the readers. This allows readers to kind of go along with Percy on his journey, rather than just read about it. It also provides a great opportunity to learn about Greek mythology, which is a lot of fun to read about! I think Percy’s curiosity about his new life, the other characters, and the tie in to Greek mythology are the books strongest factors.

I don’t want to go into too many details about which Greek Gods make an appearance, or about any of the challenges that our trio faces because I think that experiencing everything and figuring it out with the characters adds to the fun. This story will make you laugh, it will educate you in a fun way, and it will have you rooting for the characters to do their best. It’s heartwarming and fun, in all of the very best ways."
105,106,5,"As a huge lover of mythology, I couldn't resist the first Percy Jackson movie when it came out years ago. However, I didn't know it was a book (series) until later. Now that the new adaptation is well under way, I decided to finally read the series and treated myself to this illustrated edition of the first volume.

The story is rather simple: Percy is a 12-year-old boy who always gets into some weird kind of trouble. He's been moving around and switching schools a lot because of that. One day, he finds out that he's actually a demi-god and hunted by other mythological creatures - especially now that half the paranormal world thinks his father (Poseidon) has stolen Zeus' ultimate weapon.
Not in order to clear his absent father's name but in order to get his mom back, he hatches a plan and with the help of his satyr protector and Athena's daughter of all people, he goes on a quest. What else is a demi-god supposed to do?

I like that while this story is rather simplistic, it has its twists and turns and we get a good look at all kinds of mythological creatures from the Greek pantheon. And while it is aimed at younger readers, that didn't stop the author from addressing quite some uncomfortable but also important topics. Best of all, though, was how self-aware the author was while writing the book and thus made Percy be just as self-aware. That made for some funny commentary.

Like I said, I treated myself to the illustrated edition for this first ride through Percy's world so of course I also have to mention the illustrations.







As you can see, they are nicely colourful (there are many more but I didn't want to overshare, and while the style isn't the most beautiful I've ever seen, I think it compliments the story very well and fits with the book's character.

Seriously, it was so much fun being stuck in a certain summer camp, if only for a little while, and getting to know all the other kids. Sure, there is some glossing over over dark stuff that is in the actual myths, but I was fine with that in context and now I can't wait for the next adventure."
106,107,5,"July 2019 Reread:
The Percy Jackson books are proof that you don't need to weave beautiful, overly-complicated words with deep, abstract and poetic meanings to come out with a good book. Uncle Rick is a master storyteller that somehow transcends generations. I read these books in 9th grade (14/15yo), and I'm now just a few months shy of 25yo (10 years since!) and I still love this shit so much. His storytelling still made me LMFAO. I still love the characters. I still admire the way he weaved the myths into modern times. And I just miss it so much. I remember reading all 5 books of this particular series in 5 days when I was in high school. I would come home from school, sit at the dining table and consume one book a day. Those were the good days when I still had time to spare. And fun fact! I even managed to influence my friend's brother who never reads to read all of the Percy Jackson books. To this day, it's the only book series he's ever read but I still take that as a win.

All in all, I missed this world so much and I missed Percy and Annabeth. I can't wait to reread the shit out of them."
107,108,5,"This series has it all- cool, realistic characters, action sequences that thrill, references to modern culture (love the St. Louis Arch, and Las Vegas visits), and Greek mythology. I cannot recommend this series to enough readers. You're not cool if you do not know about Percy and Co.

Todo el hipe que HP nunca me hizo sentir, Percy Jackson lo ha logrado con creces, haciendo que me sienta como una niña pequeña desde el momento en el que empecé con la primera página y aun así, como si hubiese leído esta historia en el momento exacto de mi vida. Amor puro. Personajes de lo más geniales (necesito un Grover en mi vida). Disfruté la historia de principio a fin.

still as good as it was when i first read it when i was 10
______________________

Read #3:

okay so the other day my cousin brother who is like 8 called me up to complain about Luke Castellan and asked if i knew who was my god parent and i cried ok like yes baby bro that’s the way to go✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻

so anyway i was hit by this huge wave of nostalgia for the lightening thief trio and i just had to re-read this series






i was super young when i first read this series and its bc of Rick Riordan that i started reading books in the first place. it brought out my love and obsession towards Greek mythology and tbh it’s the best thing that ever happened to me.

so anyway the plot revolves around Perseus ""Percy"" Jackson, a 12 year old student, who finds out that he is in fact, a demi-god and thus begins his journey in a whole new world.

he then goes on this quest with Annabeth and Grover to

and bc i love all the prophecies written by Rick Riordan since they are written so well, here is the prophecy in this one:









Percy was such a mood throughout the series bc like he's always so cool and down for everything and never knows what he's doing like



Annabeth and Grover were both so amazing. they were both brave and loyal and hilarious. expecially grover and his nervous eating. also, is it only me who think that when Annabeth was kinda mean to Percy it was bc she had been crushing on Luke for a long time but then Percy comes along and all she can think about is him??? especially when she called him seaweed brain and she's all confused with her feelings??? tell me its not only me

and when Percy called Annabeth



i don't think i've ever simped so hard for a couple as i did for Pacbeth and when they do finally come together after a long time in the last book of the series??

overall, this is like my favourite series in the entire universe and i cannot wait to re-read the next books. whoever has not read this series yet needs to do so like now bc its just keeps getting better and better and like there is nothing better in the universe and bc all of Rick Riordan's books give a feeling of being home and its just so peaceful here.

God I’d missed Seaweed Brain 😂😂😂"
112,113,5,"Fun, action-packed, and intense. This is a book a child eight or older and an adult who is young at heart can enjoy. I especially, heartily recommend this book to fans of the Greek myths. I thought Riordan's approach was very fresh and original, but showed respect for the origin myths. Having a lifelong interest in Greek mythology, I found myself wondering, hmm, I wonder if he's referring this or that story, only to smile and nod. Having said that, I believe that a person unfamiliar with the myths could still love and enjoy this book. If you enjoy a good urban fantasy story, please don't this dismiss this book as merely a kids book and overlook it."
113,114,5,"Having completed the series, I was shocked to find that I only gave this 4 stars and no review. The first entry was so refreshing and fun, it was over before I knew it. It kicked off my obsession with Percy and the guy who created him, Rick Riordan. I think it's next to impossible not to fall in love with this world. It's original, exciting, and often comedic. This book and series never takes itself seriously even when things get downright grim. I even enjoyed the movie version."

- tout
- l'humour, la tendresse et la sincérité d'un auteur qui parvient à incarner des personnages véritablement tout jeunes adolescents, avec leur sarcasme et leur témérité et leur fragilité et leurs craintes et tout ça et je aaaah, pour une fois qu'on a de la littérature jeunesse où l'auteur sait garder sa juste place et parvenir à construire des personnages d'enfants sans plaquer sur eux toutes ses névroses ou chercher à démontrer à chaque page qu'il est intelligent, ça fait du : bien
- Annabeth a un poignard
- un poignard
- la meuf n'a pas notre temps
- mon empire pour elle
- problèmes de papa : relatable
- son papa l'utilise : relatable
- relation de papa toxique : relatable
- Percy veut que son père l'aime et être un bon enfant pour lui mais ça ne sert à rien parce que son père accorde davantage d'importance au bombé de ses orteils qu'à l'épanouissement émotionnel de son fils : relatable
- Grover parle aux animaux
- Grover fait de son mieux et n'est jamais jugé par ses amis qui l'encouragent et le soutiennent
- il y a des monstres
- à deux reprises des cheeseburgers sont consommés
- j'ai des problèmes de maman et cette maman-là est juste formidable je veux qu'elle soit ma maman finalement
- moi j'ai un truc un peu cassé dans ma tête qui vrille et tombe dingue d'enthousiasme chaque fois qu'il y a genre des groupes avec leur culture propre et leurs caractéristiques et que genre on se construit dedans tout en se nourrissant des forces et des spécialités de chacun car je suis une grosse gauchiste communautariste qui pense que la différence est une force ET qu'il y a de la force à trouver dans le fait de grandir avec des gens qui nous ressemblent quand on est issu d'une minorité ET aussi une force à trouver dans le fait d'échanger et de grandir avec des gens différents etc. et bref tout ça pour dire les douze cabines avec des symboles de chacun des dieux et genre les groupes de demi-dieux qui en sont issus et tout et genre chacun a des caractéristiques et dans le même temps ils sont tous UNIS bref j'aime trop bravo

How have I not read this until now? Someone should've slapped me and put this book in my hand and held me hostage until I read this series!

I wish this book came out when I was younger because I would've been obsessed with this. It's like Potter, I didn't experience either as a kid but still thoroughly love them as an adult. I gave this four stars to start out because I usually give first in series four stars - they are usually the starting grounds for the series. I think this one warrants a five star rating though - it completely drew me in and I had a blast. I'm a BIG middle-grade fan and have been all my life. I think a lot of readers miss out on this category because they thing it's too ""childish."" The middle-grade category has been putting out solid work for a very long time now and it just keeps getting better. I also love that middle-grade focuses on different things than YA such as adventure, family and friendship. This book possessed all the markings of a great MG book.

Percy is so freaking cute, I just love him to death! I can't think of anyone I really hated in this - even the villains had likable and fun qualities. Ares cracked me up a ton and I hope he comes back in later books. Percy's sidekicks, Annabeth and Grover are also amazing. Only thing was that every time I heard the name Grover, I pictured the blue monster from Sesame Street. Am I the only one who did that? Yes? Ok cool! They were the perfect sidekicks - intelligent, great friends and completely flawed - just how I like it!

I was surprised at how much Greek mythology is really talked about in these books. Rick does a great job of fitting in the various stories and traits or the gods/titans without feeling like you are being schooled. It's very accessible for anyone I believe - young children would have no issues with understanding what is going on.

I also loved me some Hades - I need a lot more of Hades! I was actually excited that Percy is a son of Poseidon and not Zeus (which seemed like the more obvious choice). I won't go into too many details on this book because you should go into this knowing as little as possible and just go along for the ride with this insanely fun characters and the humor is great for children and adults alike.

Highly recommend this! Don't be an idiot like me and let this sit on your shelf for years, read it!"
119,120,5,"Can you believe when I first picked this book up was because of the movie and because it was being sold at a really low price? Honestly, I was so dumb haha -.-

First of all, I can't believe how different the movie is compare to the book. I mean, I knew it was different but now on my second read I can see it more clearly (idk why). Like, the only thing they have in common is the name of the main character -.-





Well, I love my Percy. He's just the funniest and most sarcastic boy that exist! I annotated my book this time and I think 70% of that were ""hahaha"" :P I think it's the funniest thing when he's about to be killed and he decides it's a good time to say something sarcastic or annoying.






One of the most beautiful things this book has is the friendship. Grover, Annabeth and Percy make such a kickass, and at the same time adorable, team. The love for each other is so pure and they would do anything to protect one another <3

Moreover, since I was a little I've loved Greek Mythology so to see those powerful and sometimes terrifying creatures from the myths playing characters so human was incredible. It reminded me a lot of the Disney movie .




Honestly, I didn't find anything that I dislike about this book. It's possible that the fact that it is one of my favorite books makes me less critical but I still love it not matter what <3"

Amazing!! Loved it can’t wait to read the next! And oh my word Luke!! AHHH
And I love Poseidon and Percys relationship like Aw! And I’m happy for Grover!

I know so many people ship Percabeth so I’m assuming they get together at some point in later books but I already ship them😂



This was so much in to revisit!! I definitely enjoyed this more than the first time I think. Or maybe equally but this was definitely fun to reread❤️"
121,122,5,"I am so glad I finally decided to dive into this series!! I cannot wait to get started on the next one! I was a little hesitant to read this book at first since it is a middle grade series, but I am so glad that I did! ❤ I never wanted to put the book down. I read it in 24 hours, which rarely happens for me! It was so fast paced and action packed!! Really excited to start the sequel right now!"
122,123,5,WHY HAS IT TAKEN ME THIS LONG IN MY LIFE TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!! I understand all the hype now and I am so freaking excited to read the next books!! I love Percy and Annabeth and Grover! I loved how fast paced and fun it was! It's also got me fascinated about Greek mythology now!! I just loved it incase you couldn't tell!!! (Also for some reason it says I've read this before? But I haven't 😂)

The characters were all amazinggg and the plot was really good too. It was pretty enjoyable. And the chapter titles always made my day. really.

but I have one litttle problem:


WHYY?? 😭"
127,128,5,"how did i live my childhood properly without reading HP and Percy Jackson in elementary school? the world may never know.

I really do not feel the need to give a summery of this book whenever most people have read it/want to read it. It’s just one of those books when you may not have read it, but you’ve definitely heard about it. If not, check the synopsis.

Now, I opened this book, read the table of contents, and automatically knew this was going to be good. Have you guys seen those headings?

It’s really hard to review a book that has already been reviewed by the majority of the goodreads world, and who said I had any input in anything goodreads related? I’ll keep this short so I don’t bore you half to death.

Was the writing in this book perfect? No, not really. But it was oddly addictive. It’s something about the simplicity of middle grade novels that make them good.
With that being said, this book was just that. Fast paced, and amazing.
It was nostalgic without having any nostalgia attached to it. It was like everyone else’s nostalgia made me want to love it, which I did. I couldn’t put it down.
I’m not sure what else to say. But when have I ever known? Somehow I figure it out though.
If you haven’t picked this up, I advise you to do so immediately. Especially if you need help with your reading challenge and want something fast, this is definitely it.

128,129,5,"5 STARS.

Such a fantastic start to the series! I love Percy (+ all of the characters) SO much 😭🤍"
129,130,5,"One fine day.....
A girl, let's call her A, was strolling through her library. She was racking her brains, thinking about what she should read next. Definitely there couldn't be a match of the Harry Potter Series, could there? Suddenly, she saw a mysterious light, a trident floating in mid-air! She followed it and came up on this book. .She saw a book with a cool cover, and as she read the title, she remembered that this was the very book her friend was holding days ago. She thought, The next day, all she could think about was Demigods, Satyrs, Greek gods, and water, water and water and the son of Poseidon.

I finally thank you Fate, because of you, I met this AWESOME book. Now, why this book is awesome?
I can't give you all the reasons, they are as uncountable as the stars in the sky. But, here are some of them...
1.



It kicked off with one of the best start ever. If you're a rebel, you're definitely going to like it. Like awesome comic timing, but the funny things to ruin the story.
2. Interesting story plot. One of the best story plots. Like Greek Gods in America, with demons hunting the demigods and all those things? You don't find plots and themes like this in every book, do you? It says the story of a boy, Percy who suddenly finds that he is a demigod, soon his mother disappears before her eyes, and he is dragged to Camp Half-Blood, a camp basically for Demigods. he comes to know he's a son of Poseidon and that's when he dangers start, people think he stole Zeus's bolt and while others think he stole Hades's cloak, as time ticks by, he has a deadline to find the things and return them. But, he needs that time to find his mother. Mother or Gods? Then begins his quest, and last Luke, his dearest friend is actually...
It is really really entertaining and also educational. Before reading this, my knowledge on Greek Gods were same as that of the rocket science,(a perfect zero). But, THIS very book compelled me, forced me, dragged me towards encyclopedias and websites about Greek Gods. It said something like this, ""If you plan to read me, you gotta know everything about Greek Gods.""
3. Awesome characterization, like the characters are not know-it-all, do-it-all superman kind of characters.But they were the normal, weird, freak kind of characters. So definitely points for that. I wished that I had Dyslexia and ADHD! But letters, demons, broomsticks, wands, tridents, they never come to us now, do they?
4. I don't know what to say, my mind is full of praises and that's why I can't type anything intelligible. I loved it from the very start. I loved it till the very end. Loved it throughout with all of my heart.

Thank you, Rick Riordan to make our lives more magical, more historical, more everything.
P.S. This is for you Ares....."
130,131,5,"My son and daughter were both reading this and asked me to read it as well. I asked my son to rate this and he gave it 5 stars. As a lover of fantasy and Greek mythology, I quite enjoyed this one as well. The best part was discussing it with my kids and hearing their thoughts. Highly recommend!"
131,132,5,"To express how much I loved this book, I’d like to quote our friend Morgan:

“This book is Jesus!”

Seriously, Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief is freaking hilarious! That’s how I must have looked 99% of the time while reading (only with better teeth and minus the beard):




It's one of those feel-good books that just makes you happy. Should you ever feel down and be in need of some cheering up I’d recommend you to read this book.

Hola, estoy vendiendo voluntariamente mi alma a Rick Riordan ahora mismo. No me arrepiento.

es el comienzo de la maravillosa saga de fantasía y mitología griega por Rick Riordan. En este libro, conocemos a Percy Jackson, un chico ""problemático"" al que siempre le han ocurrido cosas extrañas que lo han obligado a cambiar de colegio muy seguido. Llega el día de un viaje escolar, y lo que Percy no sabe es que una serie de eventos desafortunados lo llevarán a descubrir que es un mestizo, el hijo de un Dios y un humano, y que tendrá que asistir a un campamento de verano para mestizos, en el que estará a salvo del peligro y será entrenado para ser un héroe.

Yo soy muy reacio a leer sagas, más que todo porque le tengo miedo al compromiso. También me asustan esos autores que parece que cada año ya tienen un libro nuevo bajo la manga. Por eso, Percy Jackson fue una saga que decidí atrasar y atrasar desde que comencé a leer como hobbie, sumándole el hecho de que la fantasía es un género que no me atrae mucho. Pero no habían pasado 3 capítulos y ya estaba completamente inmerso en este mundo y en la escritura de Rick Riordan. Es ese enfoque a un público muy joven lo que me hizo desear haber leído esto teniendo trece, lo que me hizo apreciarlo mucho más.

Soy muy fan de la mitología griega, y el modo en que Rick cuenta esta historia de una forma tan dinámica hace que sea divertido aprender sobre ella, e incluso te deja con ganas de saber más. Me encontré sonriendo muchas veces porque ya conocía muchas de los mitos, monstruos y deidades que este libro contiene, pero me hizo verlos de un modo mucho más infantil (que necesariamente no lo hace malo), ligero y divertido.

Sus personajes son increíbles. Percy, Annabeth, Grover y todos los mestizos son el ejemplo perfecto para los chicos como yo que nunca sintieron que pertenecían cien por ciento a algún lugar. Cada uno tiene una personalidad muy inmadura en cierto sentido ( lo que esperarías de un niño, vaya), así que es genial ver interacciones acertadas entre ellos mientras lees. Es un ejemplo muy lindo de que tu familia no siempre es de sangre y de que siempre va a haber algún lugar en donde perteneces.

No quiero hacer esta reseña más larga porque la gran mayoría de ustedes ya lo ha leído y no hay mucho que pueda añadir que ustedes ya no sepan. Estoy muy feliz de haber comenzado a leer esta saga, y estoy bastante seguro de que no pararé hasta haber terminado la saga principal. Muchas gracias a todos los que me recomendaron este libro y a todos los que han leído esta reseña hasta aquí. Nos vemos en la siguiente.

Hi, I'm willingly selling my soul to Rick Riordan right now. I don't regret it.

is the beginning of the fantastic fantasy and greek mythology saga by Rick Riordan. In this book, we meet Percy Jackson, a ""troubled"" kid who always seems to attract problems that force him to change schools. The day of a school trip arrives, and what Percy doesn't know is that a series of unfortunate events will lead him to discover he's a demigod, son of a God and a human, and will have to assist a summer camp for other demigods, where he'll be safe and will be trained to become a hero.

I'm always reluctant to read sagas, mainly because I'm afraid of commitment. I'm also scared of those authors who seem to have a new book every year under their sleeve. That's why Percy Jackson is a saga I've delayed and delayed over the years I've been reading as a hobby, adding the fact that fantasy is a genre I don't look forward to reading as much. I wasn't even three chapters in when I got hooked on Rick Riordan's writing. It is that focus on a very young audience that made me wish I had read this when I was younger, which made me appreciate it so much more.

I'm a big fan of greek mythology, and the way Rick Riordan tells this story in such a dynamic way makes you want to learn more about it that leaves you craving for more. I found myself smiling a lot because I already knew many of the myths, monsters, and deities this book features, but it made me see them in a way much more childlike (which doesn't necessarily make it bad), light-hearted and fun way.

The characters are amazing. Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and all the other half-bloods are the perfect example for kids like me who never felt like they belonged somewhere. Each one of them has a very immature personality (what you would expect from a kid, honestly), so it's very nice to see some accurate interactions between them as you read. It's a very nice example that your family is not always blood and that there is always going to be someplace where you belong.

I don't want to make this review longer because most of you have already read this book and there isn't much to add that you already don't know. I'm glad I started reading this saga, and I'm pretty sure I won't stop until I'm finished. Thanks to everyone who recommended these books to me and to everyone who has read this review. I'll see you soon."

143,144,5,"This book is very good and a great start to the series!! The characters are very relatable and lovable and you just want them to succeed!!! The book also teaches quite a bit about Greek mythology without boring you. I would definitely recommend this one, it's one of my absolute favorites!!!"
144,145,5,"This is one of my favourite series ever. Whenever I feel depressed, fed up with the world or just melancholy this is one of the stories I pick up to reread.
I was always interested in greek mythology and I find it fascinating.
I love how the author portrayed these almighty beings and fit that complex world into our modern one, I simply love almost all of the characters, especially Percy because he is intelligent, funny, sarcastic, strong, kind and just awesome!!! I also like the plot, the writing style, the action scenes and non-action scenes too. There is nothing I don't like, really.
This series is absolutely amazing, funny and unforgettable."
145,146,5,"Sign me up for Camp Half-Blood!

Surprisingly enough, I’ve haven’t had the chance to pick up this series. I always heard wonderful things about so I decided to dive right into it.

I absolutely loved it! Who wouldn’t want to be the Son of Poseidon?! I may be biased over loving the ocean, but hey it’s better than the Son of Hades right?

A fairly quick read, but that can be expected from a middle grade book. Overall 5 Stars! I’m excited to dive further into the Percy Jackson series with book 2. I can only imagine what this school year will bring!"

148,149,5,"It was never a question of whether I was going to like the Percy Jackson series, but of when I would finally read it.

I am in love. With the writing. With the characters. With the world. I only wish I had stumbled upon this book as a child, struggling to fit in. It balances realism and fantasy so ridiculously well.

I will, of course, ignore the similarities with Harry Potter, especially this line: “I won’t go looking for trouble. I usually don’t have to.” Sounds familiar? I got over it and allowed myself to fall in love with this world with no reservations."
149,150,5,"Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

It's been a few days since I finished this book and I am still angry with myself for not reading this when I was younger. It was incredible, and not just incredible for the target audience (middle grade/young adult) but for all ages. I've read a few middle grades and one of my main complaints is how while I enjoyed the plot, everything just felt immature and too young for me (which I then go onto explain that it is my fault for reading something that I'm not the target audience for), but that wasn't the case for this book in the slightest! It didn't feel to young or immature. It felt like a typical book I would pick up. Except it was so good!

There were a few reasons to why I finally decided to give this a try, the first being one of my closest friends recommended it to me last year when I first got back into reading it again; my response was along the lines of ""I'm not sure that'll really be my thing"" well past self, you were wrong. The second was for The Nostalgia Book Club (twitter)! It was Chanelle that made me interested in picking this book up again recently, so I'm very thankful for her!

Okay. Why I totally, completely, absolutely adored this book. First, the characters. I loved Percy and Grover and Annabeth, plus some of the Gods and other side characters! They were all memorable and I want to credit that to Riordan's writing, he knew exactly how to create each character (even those that already existed!). He gave them their quirks and their personalities and I just fell in love. The trio clicked well together, even when it seemed like they didn't, throughout the quest. I also just wanna say I love that Grover is part goat.

Speaking of the quest, that was the next part of the book I really enjoyed. Considering the quest was most of the foundation for the plot, I'm glad I ended up enjoying it! In my personal opinion, more books need to have quests. Or I need to find books that have quests, because they make both the characters and the readers journey throughout the book much more entertaining. There is always twists and turns throughout the quest and this book was not an exception. I did not see the many plot twists coming throughout the book. Riordan, again, wrote these very well and his creativity was brilliant. The idea of this quest too was very unique, that Zeus had his lightning bolt stolen, like dang.

Another thing I liked was how Riordan combined parts of the real world, with aspects of mythology. Mythology has always been something that has captured my interest and this fiction story with mythologic elements was the perfect fix I didn't know I needed. This book starts with Percy at a boarding school, very normal. Throughout the book, on his quest, Percy travels through various cities throughout the United States, two that I've actually been to! The scene in St. Louis was especially captivating to me because
1. I've been to St. Louis
2. I've been inside the arch and know the surroundings of it pretty well
It was crazy to imagine that part of the story happening at a place I've been before, but it's also really cool!

Another thing that made this book enjoyable for me was the narrator of the audiobook. Jesse Bernstein really knew how to voice these characters to encapsulate their entire essences and personalities. It just added this whole layer to the experience and I am so glad I ended up picking this up in an audio format.

I now feel like I need to binge read this entire series along with all of Riordan's other books."
150,151,5,"""... A hero's story always ended in tragedy (page 351)."" This is the one line that intrigues me the most after re-reading THE LIGHTNING THIEF - Book 1 in the Percy Jackson and The Olympians Pentalogy.

Author's Writing Style: 5 stars!!! Yay - The first person narration in past tenses is a joy to read. Rick Riordan shows how a comedic fantasy story is written without being complicated. This book is a page-turner. It is consistently easy and entertaining to re-read for all ages.

- There is no glossary to explain who are these Greek gods.

: 4 stars!!! - For those who are interested in Zeus, Poseidon, Hades and other gods, this book serves as the ideal introduction about them as told by their children. You will never get bored, I swear.

- Strong resemblances. I am not sure if it's only a coincidence or it's a spin version. Percy Jackson is as stubborn as Harry Potter. Glover is a loyal best friend to Percy as Ron to Harry. Lastly, Annabeth is as smart as Hermione.

: 5 stars!!! - This book gets every thing you expect for a fantasy story. Re-reading it makes me realize the transitions from chapter to chapter are as smooth as silk. Plot thickens fast but it never dissolves any character at any point of the story.

: The story of the middle chapters could be predictable.

At last, done reading Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief. I love the way that it's written in first-person perspective. It's easy-read. It's light. It's insightful. Just page one and it felt like I'm Percy Jackson. I'm the son of Poseidon.

Also love the humor sprinkled all throughout the book. like this one: ""He was reading a huge book with a picture of a wizard on the front, (p. 336)."" Jeezy, this is clearly a free promotion for Harry Potter."

156,157,5,"Percy Jackson has problems. He has dyslexia and ADHD. He has a stepfather from Hell. He's been kicked out of more boarding schools than he can count on one hand. And one of his teachers just sprouted wings and tried to kill him.
Now, kicked out of yet another boarding school and on his way home to New York, Percy realizes that he can add ""might be going crazy"" to the list. But when he gets to his mother's NYC apartment only to see her rattled and ready to send him to some strange summer camp where all the campers claim to be fathered by Gods, Percy realizes there's more going on than he could have imagined. And he's about to find himself in the middle of a war between three of the most powerful Gods around.

Like many people, I'd had this on my to read list for quite awhile, but could never seem to make myself get around to it. I'm not sure why; I love mythology, and was a bit obsessed with it as a kid. Maybe I was afraid I'd be disappointed. Then a good friend of mine, NL* Jenn read the series and started pushing it hard. Something to know about Jenn: she is a hardcore, card-carrying Harry Potter fanatic. When she compared the Percy Jackson series to HP, I knew I had to read it; Jenn does not toss Harry around lightly.

She was right. There's a definite Harry Potter feel about the book, but not at all in a bad, rip-off way. Percy definitely stands on his own two feet, but some of the magic that was captured by Rowling has been captured by Riordan as well. Percy is thoroughly engaging, and his story is full of humor and tension and the fantastic, while still feeling believable and root-forable at its core.
Here's why:

: I think Riordan made an excellent choice in creating Percy and his other characters. The idea of a hero who's on the surface just a kid with problems is a great move for two reasons. 1) Having Percy have common issues like ADHD, dyslexia, and anger issues, and who is estranged from his parents makes him relatable. There are going to be kids reading these books that have these same issues, or know someone who does. This is going to make readers root for Percy, and feel a connection to him that is deeper and more immediate than it maybe would have been otherwise. 2) It creates balance. As anyone who's heard about the books or seen the trailer for the movie knows, Percy is the son of a god. This could have potentially made Percy to 'Other' -- too powerful and distant to be relatable. Giving him issues to deal with inspite of his lineage grounds him in reality and makes him more likeable. This extends to the other characters as well. They may all be descended from the Gods, but that doesn't mean they lead perfect, care-free lives. Quite the opposite, in fact, and this means great tension and relatability.
To go along with this, I also thoroughly enjoyed Percy's voice. The narration is light and engaging, and Percy is a nice mix of wise-ass and scared kid.

: Percy's journey is also a good choice by Riordan. He started high, with a potential war between the gods looming, its weight pretty squarely on Percy's shoulders. At the same time, he left himself room to grow over the series. There's a clear idea of where it's going, and there's room for the tension to increase as the story arc progresses. There's also a great wealth of mythology to mine, which the reader will learn alongside Percy (*gasp* kids learning while they read for fun? Score!) The mythology is fun and interesting, and Riordan uses it well.

All in all, I don't really have anything negative to say about this. I think it's age appropriate, but still able to keep older audiences engaged. The tone is good, the story's good, and it's a great follow-up for Harry Potter fans, while being able to stand on its own. When I finished this one, I immediately bought the rest of the series. Get it, read it, and enjoy it."
157,158,5,it’s a classic. that’s what it is.
158,159,5,"Although I’m sad that I watched the movie first, I’m happy that I procrastinated on reading the book so much that I forgot the entire plot by the time I actually decided to read it.

The first time I read this was last year and I was hooked from the start, I probably read each book in PJO, HOO, and The Kane Chronicles in the span of a month. Now, a little over a year later, I felt the need to reread it because it’s just .

is one of my all time favorite characters and narrators even though he is 100% a seaweed brain. Of course there’s also who is such a queen and I would have love to have read about her back when I was a kid. Maybe it’s because I study architecture and Annabeth loves architecture too that she just wins a special place in my heart. Now wasn’t exactly my favorite character at first, in fact I probably didn’t love him until book 3, but while rereading it I learned to appreciate him more.

The pacing of the book is excellent and the plot is also and it doesn’t matter that it’s a middle grade book, I’ll be rereading it until Tartarus freezes over."

162,163,5,"When the audience of a book is so powerful that they are able to petition the author to pursue a deal converting it to a television series (set to be released on Disney Plus), there is little debate as to whether the book and series is worth reading.

Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief is the novel that set Rick Riordan on the path to becoming one of the most prolific young adult authors of this generation. The novel follows the story of 12 year old Perseus ‘Percy’ Jackson who discovers he is the son of the Ancient Greek God Poseidon. After attacks from two of Greek mythology’s most powerful monsters, (the Fury Alecto, and the Minotaur), Percy makes his way to Camp Half-Blood, where he learns the true nature of his parentage and meets other demigods like himself.

Warning, spoilers below…

Now becoming the centrepiece of a conspiracy around the disappearance of Zeus’ master lightning bolt, Percy finds himself on a quest accompanied by the daughter of Athena, Annabeth, and Grover the Satyr to find the lightning bolt before a war breaks out between the Gods.

What makes this book so clever and entertaining is Riordan’s ability to use his own knowledge of the Ancient Greek deities and mythology, and put a modern twist on them. Fittingly enough the knowledgable reader will notice the parallels to this book and the myth of Perseus, both of whom slayed the Gorgon Medusa. He does this throughout the novel (and series) in keeping Percy, Annabeth, and Grover’s adventure loosely based on actual Greek myths, one of which being the ‘Titanomahkia’ (the war between the Gods and the Titans).

Riordan also had a magnificent way of personifying the Gods of Greek mythology through their most well known traits in both a relatable and somewhat factual manner, regardless of how popular or unpopular it might make them. He does this specifically well midway through the book where the God of War,Ares enlists the young Heroes help to avoid a trap for he and Aphrodite, set by his brother Hephaestus, Aphrodite’s husband, who would often design contraptions to catch the two Gods in their affair.

But what makes this book so enjoyable, above all else, is Riordan’s character development of his main protagonists. It is no easy task to create a strong story line between two characters whose parents have a godly hatred for one and other, let alone lay the ground work for one of the best young adult love arcs.

This does bring me to my most important point of this article. If there is only one thing that stays with you after reading this post, please let it be this. No matter how much you enjoyed, or love this book, DO NOT EVER WATCH THE MOVIE! The fact that Riordan himself has publicly shamed the on screen adaptation of his novels, describing it as “his life’s work being put through a meat grinder,” speaks volumes.

Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief Movie

This movie (and it’s sequel) received so much backlash from the fans and Riordan that the planned trilogy was scrapped. The main reason it performed so poorly y was due to its weak plot and inability to remain true to the book. They couldn’t even get Annabeth’s (played by Alexandra Daddario) hair colour right!
All in all this book receives a 9/10 rating on account of a very strong plot, great character development, and the author’s ability to lay the foundation for the books that follow."

Oh how I've missed this world ♡



It has been so long since I've read this series; originally I thought it had been 5 years but it has been more like 8! This was the first series that made me love reading, the first series that made me cry when it came to a close. I am so happy to have finally reread it because I loved it just as much as I did all those years ago



Percy Jackson is one of those series that instantly makes you yearn to be part of the world and befriend all the characters. Within the first 100 pages, I already wanted to be at Camp Half-Blood and go on a quest with Percy, Annabeth, and Grover. This book is just so . It creates this world similar to Harry Potter where you just want it to be real. I love mythology already as it is, and this novel actually goes into details of myths and gods and creatures in such a fascinating and whimsical way.

It's hard to write an actual review for this book because, like,....it's Percy Jackson. . For me, this series is the same how Harry Potter is to others. I just have so much love for it and I want everyone around me to read it and enjoy it as much as me



Also, this book is...375 pages? It feels like 100 pages. Rick Riordan writes so effortlessly the pages truly fly by. I decided to start rereading this before bed and suddenly I was half ways done! Rick Riordan is really a great author. He describes these unique, fantastical scenes in such simple clarity, accompanied with this light-hearted, humorous mood. His writing can be enjoyed by people of all ages as it is easy to read while still having a great storyline, lovable and well-developed characters, and interesting tidbits about mythology.



So if you have not read this series yet...go get it. Right. Now. What are you waiting for? GO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND THANK ME LATER


Do you ever just get an overwhelming sudden need to reread a book because I just glanced over at my bookcase and realized it's been 5+ years since I've read Percy Jackson and I MISS THIS WORLD"

OMG I missed percy.

The book follows twelve year old, percy jackson, semi god and a little too much sarcastic for his own good. In a world where gods and monsters are real, percy needs to find the courage and strength to be the hero everyone says he is. And this is just the beginning of your journey.

, I read the series for the first time back in 2014 and now I’m not a 14 year old girl who just started to love reading, and yet this book is good the same way.
I love every character in this book so much. was the first fmc that I looked at and thought “I really want to be her”, and now I love her the same way. (yes, I’m in my 20s and I want to be her still)
was made to be that character for comic relief and he is, don't get me wrong, he’s perfect for that. but he is so much more and I am excited to follow his journey againn.
ok Oh that is my child. He is at the top of one of the like ten children, fictional or not, that I love. He is a complete menace and I love that for him. Twelve year old him really looked at everyone and said

Thank you rick riordan. I could read your shopping list and give you five stars.

I’M SO EXCITED FOR THE SERIES!!! and hear me out: when the series comes out we can have an edit of “Percy Jackson being a menace for 15 minutes straight” and I’m here for it."
169,170,5,"Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood.

Well, friends, this is the book that started it all.

(Thanks @Emily Reed for the buddy read!)

Flashback to twelve-year-old me, stumbling across the Percy Jackson boxed set in a thrift store. I hadn't wanted to be there, as there was nothing much fun about following my grandma around as she zipped down the aisles in her old lady scooter. That was until I came across a small corner piled with books. This series sat right in the middle of them, as if was specifically waiting for me, calling my name.

When I started reading this for the first time, I couldn't stop. I think I finished it in a day or two because I could not physically make myself stop reading. It's one of those middle grade classics that reels you in and plunges you along a wild ride, never for a moment letting up on the adventure.

It has been five years since I read these books, and I missed them with such longing that I couldn't bear to be away from this world for a second more. I feel like I have lived and grown alongside these characters as if they were my own friends. Percy Jackson & the Olympians became my entire personality in middle school, and I have no regrets.

It was beyond enjoyable to read this for the second time. The first time I read this, my perceptions of the characters and places were marred by the movies (we don't talk about those), but rereading felt like a fresh start, with my own perceptions of the characters and setting guiding the way.

There were so many little details that bloomed ""wow"" moments in my head during the reading process. While I remembered most everything that happened in , small things resurfaced that added complexity back to the world, like how Grover has the ability to sense emotions (totally forgot about that) or that Sally Jackson married Gabe because he was so smelly his stink overpowered Percy's demigod scent. (Definitely makes sense.)

One of the things I was most nostalgic for with these books is the humor. Percy's voice is utterly hilarious and it made me smile or burst out laughing an uncountable amount of times. Just the way he describes things is so iconic.

For example, this:



And this:



Or this:



This book reminded me , and it made me love him all the more. It also reminded me of the days when Percabeth was my E V E R Y T H I N G and make me fall back into that phase.




Smol Percabeth is literally the cutest, fight me.





Annabeth was (who am I kidding, she still is) my role model in my early teen years and beyond. With both her and Percy around, the sass levels were through the roof.






Naturally, I love her because she's my half-sister (#AthenaCabin), but also because she and Percy complement each other so well. Also, you're telling me one of her camp necklace beads is of a centaur in a prom dress?? *spits out water*

Part of my heart is at home in Camp Half-Blood, and I was so glad to return here for the summer. No one can tell these tales quite like Uncle Rick. These books are a treasure (just like everyone in this fandom <3) and I am so excited to reread the rest of the series.

On that note, I will leave you with a question posed by Percy Jackson himself:"
170,171,5,"Well I finished it and there were quite a few differences from the movies. Books are always better than the movies, but in this case the book REALLY was better than the movie. Overall I loved it and I’m very happy there are many more to come :)"
171,172,5,"5 stars. A fantastical tale of greek mythology set in modern times. The sons and daughters of the greek gods and goddesses will have more than one adventure in store. But more than that they'll have even more danger than they could have ever expected to.

✔ becoming so faun-ed of grover.
✔ percy is all washed up again.
✔ annabeth figuring it all out.
✔ friend or foe? things aren't as easy to decipher.
✔ the legends are true and some aren't very pleasant.
✔ the teachings of a centaur will carry you through.
✔ power of the poodle!
✔ the cabins are amazing. which one would all of you want to be in?

With how much I love mythology, I can't believe I haven't read this series yet but here I am and I am so happy about it. is the first installment in the series and let me tell you I was hooked right from the beginning. Percy is such a sardonic character and I was smiling with all his observations and he's also incredibly sympathetic. It's so easy to root for him and want good things to happen! Too bad, he'll be caught up in so many treacherous webs laid out by the gods and goddesses of old but luckily he'll have help with a new crew! They'll be there each step of the way to lend a hand and try to keep everyone else alive while they're at it.

To start out with, is another 'troubled' kid, who gets kicked out of schools for mishaps and struggles with ADHD and dyslexia. Could things get any worse for him? Why yes, yes they can. His algebra teacher turns into a monster and nearly kills him, right? No one else seems to know of the teacher and he begins to wonder if he imagined the whole thing.



As things progress, Percy finds out he is a demi-god, meaning one of his parents is a greek god/goddess. It gives him abilities but also puts a target on his back from the monsters roaming around, some more dangerous than others. But there is a safe haven and it's called Camp Half-blood, where all the other demi-god kids come to learn to defend themselves and to have some protection from the outside world.

Percy is thrown right into the fray and when he is claimed by one of the gods, his life changes even more. Here, he meets Annabeth and Grover, both of which become his friends. They're great characters and Grover surprised me a bit through the course of the story. They all go on a quest and it has a few unexpected twists.



It's a middle grade and while it does read like one I found it highly enjoyable. It's a book that just made me happy and I can see myself easily reaching for this book when I need a pick me up. I imagine I'll feel this way about the entire series and I can see what it's so beloved.

The premise is fascinating, the characters are lovable and the myths are incredible. I kept trying to guess who some were before they were revealed and that's a fun part for me!





---------------------------------------------------

. I can't believe it's taken me so long to start this series because I am loving it! This was a fun read and I can't wait to continue on. I mythology and I'm just living for all of this. Full RTC!"
172,173,5,"Danger: this a part review part rant review. Tread with caution. Emotions are all over the place… And frankly, quite short.

I'll admit to not being sane when starting to re-read this for the 11th time. I know for a fact i'm a Percy Jackson fan. Every time i read the books, my scars are open again, and all the blood and emotions flow out. Now, the reason why i'm reading this is because his next book will come out in May, and i am reminiscing all his good moments. Another reason is becuase Rick Riordan is the god of Writing, please respect. (fan #1 here!) OK. Maybe i haven't been there from the beginning, it's the thought that counts. Still, Rick is always in our hearts.

Rick is awesome because:

♠There is always something charming about his characters. They are funny, witty, cute, and there is always that magical element. They always suck you in.
♠Also, i'm a total sucker for mythology.
♠Rick never disappoints.
♠He is just amazingly awesome.
♠He is a genius for writing about this world no-one knew about, and risking his life for it.


Percy is a cute 6th grader who can't seem to stay in a school for more than a year. He's got dyslexia and is ADHD, to top it off. He thinks himself to be your average branded rebel. He loves his mom, and is drawn to the Ocean. This year he's studying in a private school. There he meets Grover, and Mr. Brunner, the only teacher that seems to like him, and pass him. But then something happens at a visit to a museum. And he can't believe what he saw, heard, and experienced. That's when everything begins.

It's a magical story. It's oriented to middle school readers, but appropriate for anyone with eyes and the ability to read.

But be warned, you must read with caution.


Just make sure that you don't get too invested with this. It's a lot of money, emotions, and words.




Don't put off writing a review. Otherwise, this will happen:

→You are probably feeling lazy, and will feel lazy afterwards.
→You think it all through, and yet the words never fit in.
→You forget the quotes you were going to insert to seem like a very intellectual person...
→You probably end up regretting waiting.
→You end up writing near midnight, yet it's never perfect.
→You feel stupid because you were perfectly capable of doing it before.

And there, ladies, was the reasons to wait."
173,174,5,"This is the first mythology book I read.. and it was not bad like i'd expected.
I can say that rick riordan and J.K. Rowling write in the same way, they took stories people heard of it a lot then changed it to great books.
Okay .. so this story is about a half blood ""half-human, half-God"" who wants to save the world from WWIII but it's not because of humans, it's because of 3 brothers 'Gods' !
I realize something while I was reading, If this mythology was real, our life would be miserable, I imagined that I have infinte numbers of gods doing what they want to me, fighting against each other using nature, one may cause thunders the other a tsunami. Shouldn't the most powerful god rule? If he is a real god he could control everything not just death or water or sky..
And the fact that they have childern from mortals WHY on earth God needed to have dozens of childrens, they wont become gods even after eons!!
I this book even though I crictize the mythology it self but that doesn't mean this book isn't good.

Note: J.K used mythology like the three-headed guard dog, the serpants that petrifies you if you look at them ...

~*~*!~ re-read via audiobook and paperback ~*~*~

I first saw this book on the shelves at work, the cover caught my eye immediately (the movie tie-in cover) and it was cheap so I snatched it up and figured, why not?

The first time, I finished it in two days. I remember barely being able to put it down to function like a regular Adult. Needless to say, I bought the rest of the books pretty quickly :).

I think the movie came out not long after I found the book? Anyway, other than liking the actor who played Percy I was pretty disappointed in the film (and that's all I will say). It felt like they had missed a great opportunity there.#

There are many other reviews that say it better so I will just say this: Its not a perfect book (and some readers will probably guess some of the twists quickly) but this is so much fun and never fails to cheer me up. I can imagine myself in this world alongside my book brothers/sisters, fighting monsters and navigating being a demi-god :)

Its fun and interesting when you re-read sometimes, to look back and see the pieces come together when before you were focused on what was going to happen next and To see the larger plan unfold in your mind's eye, as you replay everything from each one.

My Godly parent? My friends say either Athena or Demeter for me.. and I have to agree :).

HELPPPP GUYS RICK RIORDAN HAS CARVED OUT MY HEART AND GIVEN IT TO THE AMAZING CAST OF 😭😭😭!!! If I could give this book 1000 stars, believe me when I say I would within a heartbeat. Percy (aka Supreme Lord of the Bathroom; iykyk) narrates this masterpiece with his funny and sarcastic voice, and if you decide to read it, then lemme just you YOU’RE IN FOR A WILD RIDE! There is so much character development and plot twists, and I LOVED delving deep into Percy’s magicky world. 5 stars all the way!!"
176,177,5,"The first time I read this book I was in the 5th grade. That was over a decade ago. Whenever I reread it, I remember what this book did for me. Harry Potter will always be my most favorite series. The thing is, I didn't grow up with Harry. I started those books when I was 4 years old. It's hard for a 4 year old to relate to puberty angst. I read The Lightning Thief for the first time when I was 9. I could relate more to Percy. As an ADD kid, I could relate to never being able to sit still. Rick Riordan envisioned a character with genuine issues (ie. shitty step-father, absent father, etc.) and was able to spin it in a way millions of people could understand and relate to a dark haired, green eyed boy going through major life changes. He also made ADD and Dyslexia superpowers. I can't begin to express what that did for me, let alone the rest of the world.

Here's to you Rick! :)"
177,178,5,"AHHHHH LOVED THIS.
I keep forgetting that Percy is only 12 but omfg my 12 year old self would definitely think of him as my #1 fictional boyfriend hahahaha.

This was so enjoyable; I cried, I laughed omgg I mean, Percy is just so sassy and sarcastic I LOVE IT. I was honestly interested throughout it all and there were no boring scenes and everything just flowed. The chapters flowed so well, which made it easy to read. These books are classified Children books, but as an 18 year old, I still felt it to be engaging.

182,183,5,"“If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself.”


Yes, I know that I'm atleast five years late to the Percy Jackson party.
Yes, I know it's a shame.
But anyways, I'm glad I read it now, even if it's way late. Because this is a book that deserves to be read, no matter the age.


The Lightning Thief, as everyone knows, is the first book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. It follows Percy, a demigod- the son of Poseidon and a human woman, Sally Jackson. Percy doesn't know about his being a half-blood, until he finds himself at Camp Half-Blood after an attack by the Minotaur. At the camp, he learns that Zeus, the god of the sky is angry, because he thinks that Percy stole his master bolt. Percy has to go on a quest with his satyr best friend, Grover and a girl, Annabeth Chase, to recover the bolt and present it to Zeus before a war takes place among the gods. Because a war among the gods, isn't pleasant for anybody...



I'm in love with this book. I didn't think I would enjoy it much since it's for 10-12 year olds. Rick Riordan proved my assumptions wrong. Yeah, I would have enjoyed it more if I read it when I was younger, but that doesn't mean I didn't love it now. I fell in love with the characters, the way Rick used Greek mythology (I love Greek, Roman and Egyptian mythology), and the simple but humorous writing.

is a fun protagonist to read about. Often, you find protagonists who are annoying and not likeable. But I didn't have any of those problems with Percy. Sure, he's a bit of an idiot, but then, he's only 12, and some immature decisions make him more real. I loved his way of narrating events, it was never boring and often made me laugh.


was fine, he didn't really have much of a use, but he's sweet and his intentions are never wrong. He's always there for Percy, and without him Percy wouldn't have survived Yancy Academy and probably not even complete his mission. But I still think that Grover's character was underdeveloped and he usually comes off as a useless hinderance in Percy and Annabeth's plans. He should have been given more of a character.


was my favorite character. She's the equivalent of Hermione Granger, but she is much more athletic than Hermione. Annabeth is a daughter of Athena, which makes sense because she's really intelligent and always has a plan. Without her, Percy would have never returned bac from his quest. Annabeth can be really sassy at times, and I love it. She and Percy have the potential for a great romantic pairing, and I'd like to see what happens in the later books!


The other characters, like Luke, Chiron, Ares, and Hades were quite well-developed too. The side characters didn't feel underdeveloped. A favorite is Sally Jackson, Percy's mom. I love her kind and cheerful personality!

One thing I would like to see in the later books is the bond between Percy and Poseidon. It would be awesome if they both bonded together and have more interactions than in this book.

The writing, as I mentioned earlier, was simple but funny. It was a little weird for me because I haven't read middle grade from some time. But since the book is for younger audience, I don't have a problem with it.

I felt really attached to this book while reading, and still do even though it's been two months since I finished it. I recommended my younger sister to read it as soon as I finished, and when she tried to put it off for later, I forcibly made her read it, and now she's in love with it as much as I am.

At last, I can only say that no one should have a childhood without Percy Jackson, because that would be an incomplete childhood."
183,184,5,"I am so happy that I got the chance to finally read this book. It was better than I thought it would be.

Percy was so troubled and depressed in the beginning of the novel. As the story progresses, he develops more confidence and knows who he truly is. Percy's humour was one of my favourite features about him. I personally did not see a relationship between Percy and Annabeth happening. As I was reading the book, I realized that they were better as friends and great at teamwork(considering the fact that their parents do not like each other).

I do not like Gabe at all, he is a terrible person. He did not care about Percy or Sally(Percy's mom) at all, he only cares about himself. I can not believe that Percy's mom would marry such an arrogant person.

The Greek mythology is very interesting. I am glad I know a little bit of Greek mythology, it helped out a lot as I was reading. I love they way the book is written and how every page makes people wonder what will happen next. It was very adventurous and that is what made me like the book even more.

I realized that there was similarities with the movie and I see the differences between them. I personally like the book better because it was more detailed of what was going on and more relatable when it comes to the characters than the movie.

Overall, I really liked the book and I want to continue reading the series. Although, I did not fully like it because I rushed the book, it made me realize how amazing this book is written and opened up a new perspective about Greek mythology( personally for me). I totally recommend this book and the series."

I randomly decided to reread this book for the first time, and I loved it. While I remembered the main points, I was surprised by how much happens in the book that I did not remember. I also remembered things that happened in the movie, that I thought happened in the books, that didn't so that was interesting. The amine example of this occurs towards the end of the book, I was waiting for luke and Percy to chase each other/ fight for the lightning bolt, but that happened in the movies, while in the book, luke just poisons Percy by putting a scorpion on him."
185,186,5,"How it took me so long to read this is beyond my comprehension, but I finally did it. I read this with my 6 year old son as his bedtime read and we both loved it so much it was hard to put down. I cannot tell you how many nights he asked if I could read for ""just a bit longer"".

Harry Potter had a huge impact on my childhood and I will forever love it for that, but if I am being completely honest, Rick Riordan is the better writer. The one thing I struggle with in re-reading Harry Potter as an adult is the writing in the early novels and this book did not have that same issue. I did not feel as though the story was dumbed down for the middle grade reader, but rather made to be more engaging in order to grasp the attention of said reader.

We loved it and have already started book two!"

192,193,5,"**Also published on my YA Book Blog**

I am both surprised and pleased to be giving this five stars (which is actually like 4.9985322197, but why get that specific?). When I first started, I definitely didn't have such high expectations despite all the hype surrounding it and the general affection for this series. But it's nice to have a good surprise every once in a while, so I'll take it!

First, I'd like to say that don't let this being a middle-grade book put you off. (It did me for a long time and now I feel as though I've been ridiculous.) Yes, it does star a twelve year old. No, there isn't going to be a lot of romance (if that's what you're looking for, you should be looking elsewhere anyhow). No, there won't be swearing, inappropriateness (some beheading though!), or a general sense that these kids are being set up for adult situations (despite all the battling of monsters). Which, come to think of it, are kind of refreshing benefits! This book relies on story to unravel and I'm rather impressed as a result.

So, we've got twelve-year-old Percy Jackson who is a labeled ""trouble-maker."" And I want to say up front that I both loved this and hated it (it may be the reason it, in the end, doesn't quite get five stars, so there). It was awesome because it throws our idea of labels out the window. Who are we to judge a kid who talks too much? Or can't focus? Or can't sit still? Or has difficulties reading? That kid at the back of the class who is always distracted, tends to maybe distract those around him, and is dyslexic? Maybe he's just a godling! On the other side of that, why is it always the kids who are goofing off and causing trouble who get the attention anyway? (Bitterness alert!) I'm just saying, they always get the attention, even if it's bad, and who suffers? The kids who are quietly sitting and trying to pay attention, so really, why bother following the rules at all when they clearly don't get you anything but ignored and a teacher who never remembers your name?

Rant over.

Moving on. I really enjoyed all of the mythology, because I'm big on Greek mythology, so it was cool because I recognized a lot of it (and noticed when Riordan tweaked some of it, just saying, look up the Medusa myth and see what really went down). I thought this was freshly done, blending in the ancient Greek stuff with the modern world in a way that was occasionally creepy, often made a lot of sense, and was usually all kinds of funny.

Which was the main reason, I think, in the end, that I loved this so much. It was incredibly funny at times. It made the intensity of the situations taken down a few notches so that it wasn't overwhelming and made everything in general feel more realistic. I was never just thinking to myself ""Gee, that isn't how a twelve-year-old would react!"" though maybe I should have occasionally. The humor really made this book and I would be intensely disappointed if I didn't see it in later novels as well.

I will mention that I've seen the movie, so some of the ending was not a surprise - and the rest of it was just like, ""Eh? That is totally not how it went in the movie!"" Which was fine, honestly. I liked it regardless of my preconceived notions going in and ultimately didn't mind that the book and movie were different (I liked both, no matter what anyone else says about the whole deal). That being said, I think that there were a few surprises as far as who the real ""bad guys"" were, the whole oracle thing was sufficiently creepy and fun to puzzle out, I liked Chiron and Mr. D, as well as Annabeth, Grover, and of course Percy. I think each character added a little something to the table and I really appreciated that.

So, ultimately, the verdict is that I would highly recommend this book regardless of your age. I'll mention that if you don't like mythology, you might still give it a shot, because this is pretty well done and isn't just chock full of ancient Greek stuff (or rather, it is and it isn't in a nice, well blended sort of way). I think this was a really enjoyable read and proves that your target audience isn't the only audience that will have a good time."

194,195,5,"“Deadlines just aren't real to me until I'm staring one in the face.”

Once upon a time, there was a small child named Kelly. Little Kelly loved to read. By the time she was 7, she had read nearly all the Junie B. Jones, Ramona Quimby, and Katie Kazoo books. Kelly and her best friend would read these books to each other over the phone for hours. After all, a fictional kindergarten's adventures never ceased to bring a smile to her face.

Some time later, Kelly's best friend began to tell her of this amazing book called, The Lightning Thief. Kelly, who still found boys quite icky and cootie-infected, was quite dumbfounded that her best friend read and somehow liked, a book with a protagonist. Imagine that! Then she began to tell Kelly how excited she was that a movie was being made, but that's not important.

Many years passed, and before Kelly knew it, a sequel movie to ""that boy book"" was coming out later that year, and guess who wanted to drag her to it? Once the movie premiered, Kelly's best friend lugged her to the movie theater and they watch the movie...it was laughably terrible. Half-bloods? Cool! Satyrs in wedding dresses? Go figure. But said the books were the most perfect series ever, so Kelly eventually decided to give it a try...



I have read at least 7 times since."

____________________________________________________________
Reread July 2021: Here I am, once again, still being overly obsessed with the world of Percy Jackson. Rereading this book always makes me feel so nostalgic. This series was my childhood: loved every moment of it. Even though it is written for a younger audience it's a fun series to read for every age.

Yes, I'm happy to be back in this world again.
___________________________________________________________
It has been two years since I last read a Percy Jackson book, so I was quite anxious to see if I'd still likethe series as much as I did before (when I was a child and now as an adult). It did NOT dissappoint. I was loving it, I loved the foreshadowing, the beginning of an amazing friendship between Percy, Grover and Annabeth.

I always highly enjoyed the first book and it was the same this time. I loved reading the beginning of Percy's journey and the betrayal of one of his, so called, friends. (I actually really liked this character when I was younger). And I still kind of like that character, but not as much as I used to.

Overall, I'm so happy to be rereading this wonderful series. I feel like I've forgotten so many details.

داستان من:
کتاب اول مجموعه قهرمانان المپ (مجموعه بعدی دنیای ریوردان) رو دوستم بهم هدیه داد. وقتی درباره‌ش سرچ کردم متوجه شدم که باید اول این مجموعه رو بخونم. از طریق اشتراک فیدی پلاس این مجموعه رو با ترجمه انتشارات بهرام خوندم.

خلاصه کتاب و نظرات کلی:
این مجموعه 5 جلدی داستان چند نیمه ایزد یونانی (پرسی و هم اردوگاهی‌هاش) و موجودات دیگه مربوط به اساطیر یونان هست. که با کمک هم به جستجوهایی برای کمک به پدر و مادر های ایزدشون میرن.
مجموعه فوق‌العاده ایه. اگه طرفدار کتاب‌های فانتزی و هیجانی هستین، (مثل هری پاتر، ارباب حلقه ها و …) مطمئنا از این مجموعه هم خیلی خوشتون میاد.

• اتفاقات کتاب بیش از حد طولانی نمیشه که کسل کننده باشه.

197,198,5,"I always wanted to read this series but as a kid completely forgot about it. I remember watching the movie when it first came out but honestly I couldn’t remember most of it. So finally I decided to start it. Everyone probably knows what Percy Jackson is about so I won’t go into too much detail of the plot and really focus on just the actual review. First and foremost, I love the writing style of Rick Riordan, it’s so easy to read and to follow. Also the fact that the chapters are short is perfect for some people, to me I don’t really care about that but I know that a lot of people HATE really long chapters, so I guess that’s a good thing as well. Also I love the perfect mix of mythology and modern time in this story. It just makes it so easy to get into the world. I enjoyed it so much even though ar first I wanted a little more depth to the charactera BUT keep in mind that this is a series with 5 novels and a few novellas so there is still potential for some more depth. I can’t wait to continue reading this series."

*Relectura*
La primera vez que leí a Percy Jackson, tenía como 17 años y (a pesar de que ya era considerada vieja para leer un libro para niños), lo amé con mi vida. Me obsesioné con la saga, con Percy y Annabeth, y me leí todos los libros que estaban en español. Esperé angustiada la publicación del cuarto libro. Y sufrí esperando la eternidad misma por el quinto.
Ahora, a los 22 años, sigo amando la serie (y no me importa que Percy tenga 12 años en esta entrega). Es una historia distinta, fresca, rápida, llena de acción, con personajes que tienen sus defectos pero también sus virtudes. Además, no faltan los momentos absurdos, chistosos, sarcásticos.
Si no lo has leído todavía... no sé qué estás esperando. Muy recomendable :)"

I wasn't very enthusiastic about the first part in Camp Half Blood with people annoyingly witholding information for no apparent reason and everything feeling not very original, but fortunately we leave the place pretty quickly and, once Percy and friends start on their quest, things start really picking up. As our heroes meet gods, monsters and all kinds of crazy situations is where the book really shines, being snarky and irreverent yet still true to the characters we know from the myths."
201,202,5,"""It's funny how humans can wrap their mind around things and fit them into their version of reality.""

I read The Lightning Thief for the first time as a child. I have fond memories of sitting under the covers with a flashlight to avoid being yelled at by my parents. But my mother said I shouldn't pursue a career as a spy in the CIA. She noticed every time.

Five stars for this nostalgic book."
202,203,5,do not expect me to be critical of this series. read it please.
203,204,5,"I am a middle child in a group of four boys, very close in age. At one point in our house, we had two bunk beds in a large bedroom and we all climbed into our separate bunks at about the same time. The oldest would usually be the one to start a story. He would ramble about an adventure and then pass the baton to the next one of us. We would keep inventing paths and peoplej, passing the story-baton for a few rounds, or until the youngest of us faded. We older ones would then pull out our book and read a bit more.

This story of Percy reminded me so much of these fun adventure stories that were allowed to do anything and go anywhere. Imagination and a fast pace rule. I can understand its popularity.

I am simultaneously reading ""The Vanishing Half"", ""Crime and Punishment"" and just started ""A Gentleman in Moscow"". Talk about contrast!!

There was just the right amount of conclusion to satisfy this book, yet enough left open to warrant a sequel.

Rather heavy with the mythology references. I'm not knowledgeable on all the gods, goddesses, and customs. But I never felt lost. There was the perfect amount of quick background given when mythology was referenced. I did not miss a beat reading or feel I needed to look anything up on google.

Percy will appeal to so many young readers. He has trouble in school, difficulty reading, a home where Dad left before he even met him. He is tenacious and his willingness to learn yields quick results. He appeals as a friend we all would like to have on our side.

A 5* adventure aimed at middle grade readers."
204,205,5,"Se avessi letto questo libro 10 anni fa penso che ne sarei rimasto ossessionato. Personaggi interessanti, storia avvincente, stile di scrittura accattivante e coinvolgente.

Gli eroi sono tutti diversi e ben caratterizzati, ma i cattivi sono davvero il punto di forza: le Furie, Medusa e il Minotauro, Ade, Ares … tutti posizionati con coerenza e attenzione nella storia, sia a livello narrativo che spaziale.

Riordan è stato veramente abile nel contestualizzare racconti e personaggi mitologici nelle moderne città americane rendendo argomenti complessi facilmente comprensibili per il target di riferimento.

Oggi, a 24 anni, sento meno il coinvolgimento nella storia però sono rimasto ugualmente ipnotizzato dalle vicende e ho apprezzato (seppur con maggiore spirito critico) questo primo volume.

Da oggi vorrò mangiare solo cibo blu. Ve lo dico."
205,206,5,"Great book, I wish I would have read this a long time ago when I was in middle school haha, but I'm glad I finally read it. I loved the writing style and all of the action. The sort of twist at the end was fantastic! I had never read anything that had to do with the Greek myths, and I felt this was a good introduction. I was worried that I would not be able to follow since I was not familiar with the myths, but I felt the author explained them just enough to provide background without it being boring. Wonderful story and hopefully I will get around to the second one sometime soon!"
206,207,5,"Still an amazing book. Second time I have read this and I still love it. I can't relate to the character much at all anymore due to my age difference, but that is to be expected.

213,214,5,"Since Percy Jackson is my favorite book series , I don't know why I didn't , ever , review it properly . Anyways , here we are. *lol* I love , love , love , love this series !! Like no other series , I've ever read . The Lightning Thief is that perfect blend of mythology and modernity that spoils you with its spicy taste and leaves you wanting for more .

Did you ever wish to live like a god , or a god's son/daughter? Read this book , and you'll give that idea a second thought (or if you're stupid like me , you'll still want to be a demigod). Because 12 year old, Percy Jackson is a demigod , half god and half mortal, and his life is not luxurious. On the contrary, being a demigod is hard work .

The novel starts off with a bang and sets the tone for its entirety . Percy Jackson is a 12 year old boy , diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia . On a school trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art , Percy vaporises his spooky algebra teacher (hmmm... this reminds me that my maths teacher is scary too) Mrs. Dodds who turned into a fury and had tried to kill him . What had Percy done that his maths teacher had tried to disembowel him ?! He finds the answers on a trip to Long Island with his mother Sally Jackson . Who reveals that Percy is the son of the Greek God Poseidon . She had kept that secret from Percy to keep him . Percy has to reach Camp Half-Blood , a training summer camp cum safe haven for demigods . On the way , his mom his killed by a Minotaur , who in return is killed by Percy .

In other news , Zeus's lighting bolt has been stolen and everyone suspects Percy . So Percy sets out on an adventure, leaving the camp , with his best friend Grover (a satyr) and Annabeth (daughter of Athena), to bring back his mom from Underworld , where Hades has kept her .

There are so many positives about this book , but no negatives. Percy is hilarious . There are monsters and high octane action . I love the characters sooo much . Grover . Annabeth . Hermes . Hades . Clarissa . Luke . Everyone single one of them . And Percy has improved my Greek mythology knowledge indefinitely . Uncle Rick undoubtedly deserves my utmost respect and five freakin' stars for this book ."
214,215,5,"Update (2/13/19): I still love this book and it's amazing and I can't wait to continue with the rest of the series!

--------

I started rereading this book after I saw the musical off Broadway in NYC. I fell in love with this series immediately upon reading it, and I wanted to experience how much I love this story again.

Percy Jackson is a twelve year old who is 'troubled' and after being attacked during a school field trip by a monster, he discovers that he is a demigod, and that his father is one of the Greek gods.

One of my favorite things about this book is Riordan's writing style. Percy, along with his friends Annabeth and Grover, are on a quest that is literally life threatening, and Riordan balances the danger with humor seamlessly. Percy is one of my all time favorite literary characters, and I am excited to reread the rest of the series and go on this journey with him again.

I think this is a great story for people of any age. It's aimed at middle grade readers, but there are a lot of elements that are enjoyable for teenagers and adults, and I highly recommend it."
215,216,5,"Okay people- it is time for a reread! Again. For the 123735485 billionth time.
Ending of summer and all that, plus I just really love this series and why not?

Okay, I love this just as much, even more of possible, rereading it. The level of sass and just pure slaying in this book it perfect. Percy is what every twelve year old should aspire to be.
And just, main characters usually aren't favorites, but man, Percy is. Grover is just sweet and amazing, Annabeth is badass as usual, and the jokes are just as funny now as they were the very first time I read it. Rick's works will never cease to be some my favorites."

It's great looking back on a story that I came to rely so heavily upon during some of the hardest years of my life. It's a comfort, like seeing an old friend. I can also see how much I've grown as a person. I remember reading this with such intensity and while it's kind of sad I don't feel that so much anymore, its also nice knowing how I've matured both as a person and as a writer.

I'm mad at myself for having deprived myself of this book for so long. I, who l̶o̶v̶e̶s̶ adores Harry Potter and really all things magic, mythology, fantasy and adventure -- 𝘐 not have read this series still? It's shameful.

I'll rectify that now.

I read the illustrated version of this book and John Rocco is truly amazing at that. I loved the art.

It was a short read. Just about 350 pages or so. So of course it took less than a day. I'll be reviewing the next book soon probably.

The pace was good. Nothing ever dragged. It was all jam packed with action and mystery and the next big adventure.
It sort of stole the awe-factor that I'd previously attached to the Gods however but at the same time, it made them even more cool if that makes sense.

I was constantly reminded of the adventures Harry got up to with Ron and Hermione.

In some way, dorky Harry who had no idea about his parents seemed like the twin of Percy who didn't know about his true father and the truth behind his genetic makeup and his celestial genes.

Grover, the stumbling protector, reminded me of Ron, the not very bright but always well-meaning and loyal best friend.

And Annabeth, the wise girl, daughter of Athena, was so like Hermione. It was unreal.

That was where the parallels ended though. Because the stories couldn't be more different.

The hurdles, challenges and demons that Percy and the trio faced were thrilling! I especially loved the way that everything seemed to be so seeped into greek mythological stories and creatures.
I've always been fascinated by all that. I can only imagine what more is in store.

Maybe I'll get to see Achilles soon. I mean I know he died in the Trojan War but come on, what good is fantasy if not bringing back dead heroes?

This is still a rushed review and I'd definitely come back and polish it up a bit later but right now, I just want to read a few chapters of the second book before I hit the bed.

I. Am. Hooked.
Percy Jackson is my new best friend."
229,230,5,"The Lightning Thief is the first book of the serial Percy Jackson and The Olympians, by Rick Riordan. This book tells about Percy Jackson, a 12 years old boy which had dyslexia and ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). He is change school many times because of his disease. He almost expelled from the school because some problem. When he visit the museum, he see that his teacher turn into a monster and he could kill the monster with a pen which can turn into a sword given by his history teacher. So far Percy had never known who his father because his mother was hiding something about his father identity. Until when they were on vacation her mother was killed by a minotaur and Percy was forced to be in a summer camp on a hill which many demigods and heroes held a camp on there. At that camp he found out that Grover his best friend was a satire who was in charge of guarding him, also his history teacher actually a centaur which train famous heroes like Hercules and many more. It was revealed that he is actually son of Poseidon, the ruler of the ocean, one of the tree great gods (Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades). Because knowing that Poseidon has a child, it means that Poseidon had admitted that he had broken the agreement not to have children from humans. If god has a child, the power of the child become more powerful than other demigod. Percy became the main suspect of Zeus’s original lightning thief and Hades’s helmet. So besides being chased by monsters, the gods also chased him. Percy adventure accompanied by his two friends Grover and Annabeth, they had mission to find and restore Zeus’s lightning and Hades’s helmet. They must reconcile the war that almost broke out on Olympus just in ten days. But the challenge was far toughter than that, Percy finally had to deal with a terrible force that was even greater than the gods themselves.
The things that I like from this book is the story, the story was amazing, it make me curious to read the other part of the book when I was read at the first time. Other interesting thing from this book is unclear characterizations between the protagonist and the antagonist , it can create a sense of curiosity and surprise the reader is full.
I suggest you to read this book, especially for people who like to read fiction novel, it can fulfill your joy when you read this book. There are many moral value that we can get from reading this book. This is my favorite moral value that I get after read this book, “hate, anger and revenge will destroy everything and until whenever, revenge will never end”."
230,231,5,"Finally finished. Loved it, as I suspected."
231,232,5,"I know, I know. I jumped into this train 10 years late. I have kicked myself for thinking I was too ‘adult’ for this ‘kids’ series. However, better late than never, right?



I started this book knowing the plot because I had seen the movie before. I was preparing myself for a boring read where I knew everything that was going to happen. I was going to do it just so I could start the other books which had not been adapted to film. How did the movies dare to say they were based on the book???? They even got Annabeth’s hair a wrong shade of not BLONDE! I really felt like I was reading a whole new story and enjoyed it far more than the movie! I just wanted to meet the director and be like...



The writing was light and humorous. As a reader, you felt like Percy was talking to you. Like you were sitting by the campfire at Camp Half Blood while he shared his first adventure there. It didn’t feel prolonged or rushed. Rick Riordan has this ability of describing and creating a picture in your mind Mr. Riordan, sir, that is a rare skill and you have earned a from me.



I think I spend more of the book just scuffing and rolling my eyes as I discovered The characters in the book are so witty and unique. Even the gods! They have very distinct personalities and not just the same old stereotypes of Dare I say, some of them were indeed *cough* Hephestos and hidden camaras *cough* *cough* Zeus’ grumbling *cough* In all they are one of my favorite cast of characters in a book series so far.

However, what takes the cake is Rick Riordan’s (I CANNOT pronounce his last name for the life of me!) storytelling. I mean c’mon! As a teacher, seeing how he used You can tell he has been a teacher for many years. His creative way of perceiving the world around us was so refreshing to see. as refreshing as J.K Rowling’s . Being from New York, I have to say I was more aware of my surroundings and imagining how it would be like if what was depicted in the book was in fact our reality. I mean I have not looked at the Empire State Building the same way again! We had a thunderstorm the other day and I just thought about Zeus having another one of his fits! That is how powerful his story becomes and how it stays with you in the long run. As someone who enjoys writing, I admire his skill and talent.



Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, I was one of those who hesitated starting this series because I was for this ! ABSOLUTELY! It is a story that speaks to every age group. It’s a fast read where the writing flows and is very easy to keep up with it. In my personal opinion, Rick Riordan’s books are great buffers to read in between really heavy and dark stories. Of course, you can also marathon through all of them as well.

All in all, I want to space them out because I want to savor them. pick this first book and give it a whirl. You will be when you realize you are laughing at the jokes and wishing you could go to If you do not enjoy it, hey, at least you gave it a try."

233,234,5,"Ah, a book that made my gayness stronger.

I have a deep love for this series not only out of childhood nostalgia but from the community around it introducing me to the idea of healthy romance and giving me a welcoming environment in books. I have a deep love for Uncle Rick and the queers that found themselves in this and helped me and many others find parts of themselves, too.

Also, I have to say, I don't have ADHD, but as a neurodivergent person who is very close to dyslexic people – and as someone with a passion for disability justice – PJO is absolutely amazing at making us neurospicy people see us in fantasy. It's so clear that he cares for the representation, and, especially as it was published in the aughts, I am grateful it exists and that it had the virality it did.

And with it being published in the aughts, there is a little bit of not-super-acceptable language used throughout the series, but we're going to ignore it because I've decided to and it wasn't used out of malice. Just don't start using the r-word or saying cripple for funsies unless you are a crip.

Anyway, I love being very gay and will always have a profound love for Percy and the gang."
234,235,5,"""If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself.""

Oh man, what can I say about this series that hasn't already been said before?

I remember reading this book WAY back in 2006 for the first time when I was only 12 years old, so this entire series holds so much nostalgia for me. In my opinion, this series is ageless, because I have revisited this series many times over the years and I always find that it feels like coming home when I open the pages and get lost within this world that Rick Riordan has created.

I adore so many things about this series: the twists on Greek mythology that the author created, friendships, destiny, mysteries, adventures, themes of destiny and what it really means to write your own life's story, and the quirky humor.

All elements of this story come together to make for an unforgettable reading experience - one that I can't wait to share with my own daughter when she grows older."
235,236,5,"I forgot how much of a quick read these books are.

Actual Rating: 5 stars

This book never gets old. I do sometimes have to remind myself that it is a middle-grade book, and that is how the writing style is aimed. But other than that, it's simple, it's quick, it's entertaining, and it's extremely informative and educational without seeming like you're being educated.

I adore Percy and I adore Annabeth, and watching them grow up all over again (and seeing their relationship bloom) is just so entertaining."

247,248,5,"2019 RE-READ
I need to start by saying that I'm seeing THE LIGHTNING THIEF: THE PERCY JACKSON MUSICAL in Toronto in March! How could I pass up that opportunity? My mom and I have front-row tickets and I am SO EXCITED!

First read these books in the winter semester of the first year of my undergrad: 2012. Fast-forward, it's 2019, and I am in the winter semester of the first year of my PhD. I started the semester off with a stomach bug, and I turned to Percy Jackson for comfort. I am so glad that I'm re-reading! I've been meaning to for a while. After, I want to finally read THE HEROES OF OLYMPUS and THE TRIALS OF APOLLO. Been putting those off for way too long.

This book is wonderful. Percy is a funny, relatable narrator who sticks up for his friends and loves his mom. I love the way the gods are portrayed. My favourite god is Hades, and Rick Riordan's interpretation of him is brilliant.


My box set of all five paperbacks arrived to my dorm from Amazon yesterday. So excited to start this!

--

I watched the movie back when it was first released on Blu-ray, and I really liked it. Now that I've read the book, I realize that they are very different from each other. Still, I think they both have merit if they are regarded as two separate works.

I know this book is probably intended for a younger audience. I'm almost 19, but I still loved this book. Most book are ageless, anyway. Much like Harry Potter, I think these books can be enjoyed by children, teens, and adults. Action, adventure, friendship, gods, monsters...who doesn't enjoy reading about these things?

I know a lot of people have compared these books to Harry Potter and said this seems like a copy, but it's not. Yes, there are similarities, but the differences far outweigh them.

I love Percy's narrative. He's funny and sarcastic and quite likeable. The fact that it's told in first-person was a wonderful surprise for me when I first opened the book. Very easy to get into.

I'm very excited to read the next book in the series, and to see the next movie."
248,249,5,"First off WOW. This book was so much fun, and I truly understand why this series has become so iconic. I am currently 14 years old, and I still enjoyed reading this series. It made me feel so much younger and like a kid again. You will absolutely fall in love with the characters, and the way Rick Riordan ties in Ancient Greek myths with real life events is so smart and fun to read. This book perfectly pictures and lets you imagine what the world would be like with Greek gods and magic. A phenomenon to fantasy novels and it was an adventure I was taken on to with the main characters. Percy Jackson is such a unique character, and funny too. His humour and his ability to relate to the reader is so good!! Grover is such a cute quirky little goat man and I would trust him with my life. He is also unique, and I loved the way his character was portrayed. Annabeth, honestly reminds me of myself except for the fact that she is much smarter and more athletic. I loved how her eyes are grey, and the way she talks about Percy and how Percy talks about her is the most precious and sweetest thing ever!! I love when she says “seaweed brain” and I just… AHHHHH. Yes this is me shipping for them and hoping they are endgame. Some final things I want to talk about and say is that you should definitely read this book!! Mythology is so fun to explore and this book makes it easy to do so. By blending mythology with real world scenarios, it is so much easier to understand. I love this book and I know I will love this series as well. This series is next to Harry Potter, and by reading it you will enter a world full of Mythology, magic, friends, and quests that keep your mind racing. A 100% need to read book that should be added to your shelf if it isn’t already."
249,250,5,"“The real world is where the monsters are.”



I am so happy that I found time to re-read this book and I'm so excited to read the rest of the series!! Which, if I'm being completely honest here, I have never read the entire series before. I've just read The Lightning Thief. I should also admit that I definitely kept comparing this book to the movie.



But let me just state that I loved this book. loved it. I am surprised at how much I missed everyone at camp half-blood. I love Percy, Annabeth, and Grover. Their friendship is like the second best thing to read (Harry, Hermonie, and Ron will be first--sorry?).









Go read this book if you haven't already.
If you have read it...read it again."
250,251,5,"LOVE THIS !

This series never gets old, even if I'm a little older XD

Percy Jackson is a 12 year old kid with ADHD and dyslexic. He has trouble at every school he has been at and he cannot control his anger
But one crazy field trip has him second guessing who he really is. Especially with weird creatures and monsters chasing him all over the U.S

This is where he meets Half Blood camp, a place for kids like him, who do not fit into society. He has never felt like he fits in until now. But all that changes when he is called on a special quest that will either kill him or save him and every one in the end
Will Percy be able to complete this quest and not lose every one he loves and cares for?

This series has the perfect mix of fantasy, action, adventure, history and Greek mythology. You learn so much from this book and you enjoy the ride.

Definitely worth taking the time to read this real classic."
251,252,5,"I've finally read this book and I can tell that it was as good as I expected.

How would our world look like if greek gods were real?
More or less just as the one we know. At least untill someone stole lightning of Zeus.

After reading 'The Lightning Thief' I am asking myself a question: how did it happen that I hadn't read it sooner? This book is really amazing. I think that anyone no matter young or old would love Percy and his friends.



Wreszcie udało mi się przeczytać tę książkę, i mogę powiedzieć, że jest tak dobra jak się spodziewałam.

Jak wyglądał by nasz świat gdyby greccy bogowie byli prawdziwi?
Mniej więcej tak jak ten, który widzimy na co dzień. Przynajmniej dopóki ktoś nie ukradnie Zeusowi pioruna.

Po przeczytaniu ""Złodzieja pioruna"" zadaję sobie pytanie: jak to możliwe, że nie przeczytałam tej książki wcześniej? Ta książka jest po prostu niesamowita. Myślę, że każdy, niezależnie od wieku pokochałby Percy'ego i jego przyjaciół."
252,253,5,"This book was really enjoyable. The plot was well written, I was fully engaged throughout this book. But in my opinion the best thing about this was the characters and the dialogue/banter with those characters. Percy was so sassy I laughed a lot whenever he went on his little rants. I haven't laughed this hard at a book in a while and it was really refreshing. I also liked Grover, he was a fun side character with his own hopes and dreams. I hope that he comes back from his quest to find Pan. I really hope he doesn’t die. Annabeth was grand. She is a strong willed female character. She has a really interesting backstory that I loved learning more about her and her emotions. Luke has good potential to be a great villain, I look forward to finding out in the next book. This was a great and solid read, I look forward to reading the rest of the series."
253,254,5,yeah I know I'm way late jumping on the bandwagon for this book but wow this book was a thousand times better than the movie. I had watched the movie awhile back and tho I did not remember much from it the book was way different and way better. I can't believe it has taken me this long to finally start reading Rick Ridoridons books I have been missing out on so much! I remember when his first book came out when I was in 4th grade I really struggled with reading then and didn't think I would ever read it. I related so much with Percy when ever he mentioned his dyslexia boi I struggle with spelling so much I never want to take written exams because I'm so bad at spelling! I can't wait to read all of Rick Ridoridons books now!!!
254,255,5,"Little 10 year old Rachel would have adored this book - and honestly grown-up Rachel did too, but this story is definitely at its peak when enjoyed by a kid audience (or for reading aloud - this book would be AMAZING!)

I LOVED how Percy’s dyslexia and ADHD were handled, and all the mythology deep cuts made my nerdy little heart so happy.

Now as a grown-up fantasy fan, the story was a little bit repetitive (Percy goes somewhere, gets attacked by monsters, narrowly escapes, rinse and repeat ). But this is written with kids in mind and the classic formula just here. A modern classic that I could definitely see myself sharing with nieces and nephews one day :)"
255,256,5,"Es war einfach wundervoll! So ein tolles Buch, super Schreibstil und als Fan der griechischen Mythology bin ich jetzt auch Percy Fan und freue mich weiterzulesen, da ich mir direkt alle 5 Bücher gekauft hatte. Ich ahnte wohll, dass ich es lieben werde!

Ah, needless to say, I've missed Percy (can you believe it's been over 3 years since I first read these!), and re-reading these books -- watching Annabeth slayyyyyyy as usual and Grover be rather murderous for a peace-loving herbivore -- is the dose of nostalgia I've been craving....like eating a delicious, homemade blue chocolate chip cookie fresh from the oven. <3

¬Happy Reading¬"
269,270,5,"My younger self is cursing me for not picking this book up sooner. The Lighting Thief is fun, action-packed, fast-paced, and has endearing characters that you want to befriend the moment you meet. Based on Greek mythology, this story manages to combine, masterfully, the ancient Greek and modern culture while throwing at you a few twists to keep things interesting. Plot-wise, there are hardly any surprises since at least the first installment is meant for children. If you go in with that in mind, you will enjoy yourself immensely.

Gods, demigods, monsters, mythical creatures, hero quests, evil entities are all part of this world. Our protagonist, Percy Jackson, a good but rebellious twelve-year-old, is oblivious to any of this. Oblivious until his teacher transforms into a monster in front of his eyes and tries to kill him. After hearing the news, his mother drives him to Camp Half Blood, a summer camp where half-god half-human kids live, to keep him safe. There he learns he's the son of Poseidon, God of the Sea, and accepts a hero quest. To save the world and prevent a war among the Gods, he travels to the Underworld and retrieves a stolen object.

Percy is one of the biggest reasons I love this story. He's not your typical good student and quiet kid. He has trouble keeping up with his classes since he has been diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD and always steps up to protect his friends against school bullies/monsters. His honesty and unfiltered thoughts give the story this humorous note I came to enjoy. His bravery and relentlessness make him a great hero. Percy speaks to us like he's our best friend. Each chapter's title is hilarious and portrays exactly his personality and how he perceives the world.

The world-building is my second favorite thing. All the greek myths and words, all the descriptions of regal Gods and fantastical places, all the magic and ominous dreams combined with our modern world make you want to discover more about this unusual but interesting setting.

The writing is engaging and straightforward. It relaxes you and allows the story to drive you in. It sets a feel-good tone, and you just know you'll have a great time and don't have to worry about a thing.

I can't wait to see what Rick Riordan has in store for us in the second one."
270,271,5,"I feel as though I could read this book over and over and never get tired of it. My opinion hasn’t changed since I first read it when I was 12 years old because I love it just as much!

In fact I’m pretty sure I learnt more Greek Mythology from this book/series then I ever did in school, and that remains true to this day! I love how it was woven into the story and no matter how much you knew beforehand you could pick up on the details as you flew through. It was modernised in a great way with its own unique tales and twists.

Combined with lots of action and adventure, it always had the potential to be great but it wouldn’t have been the same without the amazing set of characters. Percy is one of my all-time favourites because he is the perfect mix of bravery and humour but also vulnerability. On the other hand I was never particularly fond of Annabeth, yet I found myself liking her a lot more as I re-read it. Then there’s Grover of course who is simply amazing; enough said. The relationships these characters have are so nice to read about and prove that it’s not only about romance in books; friendships are just as important and meaningful.

I remember being able to relate to this when I was younger, particularly Percy as a character and the same goes for today. I’ve heard 20 year olds, even 40 year olds loving these characters and the series in general which is an amazing thing. So if you haven’t already, pick up this series because similar to Harry Potter it is something you will love no matter your age, gender or demigod status.

271,272,5,"”Even strength must bow to wisdom sometimes.”

I did a lot of crazy things while reading this book when I was 13 years old, I persuaded my Grade 8 teacher to make our whole class read this novel by going inside her office and gushing over on how great this book is. She was smilling at me while I fangirl over the plot of the story and the next morning she told our class that we need to read the .
My classmates were pissed at me, coz most of them were athletes who have no time for books but who cares? This is for their own good. Lol
Reading Percy Jackson as a 17 year old girl is a mind opening thing for me. I’ve been having a lot of trouble reading lately and the characters of this story brought me back on track.
I don’t think I need to articulate more on how great this novel is, come on fellas, this is need I say more?"
272,273,5,"Although this is my third time reading this book, I’m sure in the years to come, I’ll have it memorized.

I love love love this series, and I definitely would recommend this to anyone. You might even see another review from me later this summer! I’m actually thinking of reading this book with my brother, because he’s going to 4th grade soon and lately he hasn’t enjoyed any fiction books. This is a book I wished I read at that age.

This book brings back so, so many *good* memories…


But, yeah. This book is for almost any age, and I love how it’s okay for both kids and teens.



-Who want a good re-read
-Want a short, few-hour read
-Are stressed and need a good laugh (this is me.)
-people wanting to know more about Greek Mythology
-actually, everyone needs to read this book at least once."

I mean, I didn't jump into it without knowing everything about it . What I am trying to say here, is that even you know what this book is about when you begin it, it will still be very surprising

Wow . Everybody needs to read this book as soon as possible .
I really don't know what to say about this gorgeous , perfect book .I am speechless.
I think I just discovered another favorite series :)"
274,275,5,"En mi vida vuelvo a ver una película sin haber leído el libro anteriormente. Creo que los directores de las películas muchas veces no se molestan en leer los libros en los que están basadas, porque esto no es normal. Aunque, obviamente, el libro es mucho mejor que la película. Es increíble que un chico de 12 años sea capaz de hacer todo eso. A mi con 12 años me costaba pillarle el truco al tamagochi... En fin, increíble. Tengo muchas ganas de continuar esta saga!"
275,276,5,"[07/2021] Percy is so precious. I just love the way he loves his mom, and how he would do everything for her just the way she has done everything for him. It's pure love.
I said it before, and I'll say it again: I'll never get tired of Percy Jackson.
It's pure love, guys.

**I took my sweet time reading because I was distracted reading andreil fics on ao3. Again.
♡♡♡♡♡

I'll never get over these books.
I read them again and again because of the nostalgia that I feel when I think about the characters. It's a never ending story."
276,277,5,"Why didn't I read Percy Jackson earlier?
I'm just in love with this book it's so fantastic that I could cry!!!
Love the storyline its so amazing, love the characters there all special in there own way especially Percy Jackson his a heroic DemiGod.
I love the adventures and of course I'm in love with Greek myth now!!!
I definitely recommend this book.
And it's a million times better then the movie.
I will of course read all the series.
And I love you Percy Jackson your such a bad ass!!!❤️"
277,278,5,"I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH. The writing is just fantastic. It was fast-paced. The story was just entertaining and cool. This was the first ""greek mythology"" book that I have ever read and I can't wait to read more and can't wait to read the rest of PJO!"

I have so much undying love for this series and world and all these characters <3

Other review"
279,280,5,"Honestly this is the greatest book I’ll ever read. I genuinely don’t understand how a story about a 12 yr old can be better than any adult fantasy novel I’ve ever read.

The dad jokes, the story, the world building. I have no words. I love you forever Percy."
280,281,5,"Awesome book, I enjoyed every word of it.

Annabeth + Cerberus = laugh out loud funny (in my case very loud)

I won't say much about it except: read it. Now."
281,282,5,Reread. Still awesome.
282,283,5,"how did i wait so long? :/
this book is just so amazing i can't even begin to describe how/what I'm feeling right now.
it can't be reviewed.it's just awesome.
:))))) off to read the second book."
283,284,5,One of the first books that made me fall in love with reading! :D Can never get tired of re-reading it!
284,285,5,"This book is just as enjoyable now as it was when I read it when I was 16. If anyone is thinking about reading or rereading this, I FULLY recommend you do it! You will not be disappointed!"
285,286,5,"This is still as good as i remember it! I love the trio, but Percy is still my favorite!
Clarisse and Ares are as annoying as i remember them. I adores the scene with Cebreus, so cute!"
286,287,5,i’m annoyed that i watched the movie before reading the book because they’re not even comparable whatsoever
287,288,5,Is that book really that good or is it just my entire childhood? Probably both.

289,290,5,"Normalerweise ist Griechische Mythologie nicht so meins aber bei diesem Buch hab ich das nicht so bemerkt ,es war witzig und charmant es war eine ganz tolle Geschichte bin auch so durch die Seiten geflogen ich brauchte das eigentlich noch nicht zu beenden der Schreibstiel ist locker leicht, ich fand auch toll das er der Sohn von Poseidon ist ich liebe Unterwasser oder Wasser Geschichten, neben percy hat mir noch grover,anabeth und Chorin am besten gefallen . Es gehört zu meinen Jahres highlights . Leider hab ich die folge Bände nicht würde so gern weiter lesen ."
290,291,5,oh my god how did it take me this long to read this masterpiece???
291,292,5,dlaczego nie zaczęłam czytać tej serii wcześniej 🥹
292,293,5,"One of my favorite books of all time.
For my GR friends, this book was like how the KOTLC books are for y'all. I lived, breathed, slept PJO. And honestly, it still stands the test of time. I still love this book, perhaps more than I did before because now I notice all of the little details and callbacks. The appreciation that I have for this book is unparalleled. There is no book that I feel like jump-started my reading journey quite like this one did.
For backstory, let's go back to 2015. Tiny, baby 4th grade Eliza takes her first real field-trip at her new public school (I was homeschooled/private schooled up until this point). Her class goes to a nearby city to see a play. It is Percy Jackson and the Olympians. From the second that I watched that play, I was hooked. I read all of the books. I missed nothing. I have read these books countless times and they never get old.
The characters are amazing. No one is a cookie-cutter character. Percy is a little rebellious (who wasn't at 12 years old?) but he loves his mom. Annabeth follows the rules but breaks them from time to time. All of the relationships are beautiful and I love to see how everything gets its start. There were so many little details that I forgot about or never noticed that are so special. Each and every single half-blood is just kick-butt awesome. The worldbuilding is insane and only gets better from here on. While it is a preteen book, it can hold its own with YA novels. Honestly, I could write about this book forever but I suck at reviews. This is the perfect start to this epic story. I can't wait to relive the rest of the books.
I am re-reading this entire series because the new book is coming out. Also, for nostalgia. This is my senior year and it is so cool to re-read the books that have honestly been with me throughout my entire public school career. (Also, how cool is it that the new book is coming out during my senior year???) Reading has been the adventure of a lifetime and I'm so happy that I've been able to experience it. Thank you so much to Uncle Rick for writing these books. They truly mean the world to me.
💜,
Eliza"

Percy, Percy, Percy. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE??

When I read the first page, I just knew I was going to love it. It starts off so funny and I can totally relate to things in this book. How do I know this is funny? Well, who actually writes their chapter title as: A god buys us cheeseburgers?

Percy just can't stand school. Sure, he's a good kid but every school (six) he went to, he got kicked out. So when his math teacher suddenly wants to kill him and he (somehow) goes to Camp Half-Blood, he gets infos that he never knew about his life.

For example, that he's father is Poseidon, the god of the sea. And his two friends are not just any friends. One of them is a satyr and the other is a daughter of Athena.

And, that Zeus wants to kill him as well.

So when Percy and his friends goes on a quest, the world he never knew is like:

I swear everything Percy says just makes me smile or laugh. He's not afraid of any gods (even Ares, the god of war). Everything inside this book was everything you need in life.

He's also just like,

294,295,5,"Rick Riordan. You're a freaking genius. This book, this work of art is simply amazing. Still after 5 years, I still love this book. I can't write in words how much this book impacted me. It started my entire reading journey. I love this book so much."
295,296,5,"See more reviews at YA Midnight Reads

*Third time reading this book
Percy Jackson could have been your average 12 year old boy with a few disabilities, to be exact, ADHD and dyslexia. After a clash in with a fury, momentarily killing a Minotaur, finding out that he was in fact a demigod and that he was held for suspicion by Zeus, king of he gods... you could say Percy isn't your average boy anymore.

Personally, I find it hard to not rant about how amazing Rick Riordan writes, but here goes nothing. Going into The Lightning Thief, I had zero knowledge of Greek Mythology and now, after reading each book of this series and it's spin off series (The Heroes of Olympus) also at three times each book, I am proud to say that I am a Greek Mythology nerd. (But of course, I do prefer the term, 'wise girl'.) To create an entertaining but quite informative piece of superb writing is awfully hard to come by, so this was an extraordinary experience.

The way the characters are created is so unimaginable. Percy is a humorous character that you'll fall in love with instantly. Annabeth, is quite mysterious and an intelligent girl that may be hard to get to know, but she came around in the end. Grover is a satyr, half man half goat and is also quite hilarious in some scenes, like at Aunty Em's garden.

Action can get boring when there's too much, The Lightning Thief is not, it is well paced and balanced to produce such a likeable piece of writing that I still love (no surprises).

Overall, The Lightning Thief is one of those novels that are just simply too close to perfect. I recommend this book to anyone really, but mythology lovers would be more exact. Rick Riordan is the myth master that will take you on a ride of laughter, shock and heart racing action."
296,297,5,"Percy Jackson is just so...likeable. It's targetted for middle schoolers but just works for people of all ages. It wasn't perfect but I loved it anyway. Annabeth is literally me and I might have a small crush on Percy Jackson even though he's a few years younger than me in this book...but in a few books we'll be the same age and I can fully accept that. I do expect that the series will get better over time and as of now I am keeping it at four stars, but I really do see its potential. A few reasons why this particular book is four stars instead of five stars is that 1. it was a little predictable, 2. why were there Greek characters everywhere? there's gotta be at least one place they landed at that was free of them, and 3. it was hard for me to enjoy binge reading it, which made me sad. I'm also very surprised that the characters aren't dead yet. One good thing that struck me was the integration of Greek mythology. The way they didn't force them into the story or reference them too heavily and just let them come in naturally really appealed to me, and I liked it when I could guess who a character was before they were revealed. I also really enjoyed the twist at the end...that was one thing I didn't predict. I like how Rick Riordan isn't afraid to leave us at a cliffhanger-it doesn't anger me, it just makes me want to read the next book. Also, the chapter titles SENT ME! I wish all books had chapters like that. Percy's narration was also great. It was one of the things that kept me moving during dry spots. If Percy narrated nonfiction books, I'd be reading a lot more of them. Also...Percy and Annabeth...??? :))) So there we have it, that's my review. Feel free to debate with me what you liked and what you didn't like and I'll see you next time!"
297,298,5,"I can't believe I gave this book 3 stars the first time I read it! It's so, so good!

Percy Jackson adventure was addicting, I always needed to know more and see where they were headed! And yes I was rereading this book but what I had in my head was the damn movie! I had the vague idea that the adaptation was awful, but god! I never expected it to be this bad!!! I'm pretty sure they read a totally different book from mine. Because it's impossible to get movie from book! Btw I love with all my heart, if he was younger he would be a perfect Percy!

The characters were some of the best things for me in this book. I love Greek Mythology and I already read a lot of different versions of these Gods but I always love getting the opportunity to know some more. Ares was one of my favourites, I know he was one of the bad guys but the motorcycle/badass style just drew me to him. I also liked Hades! In most books I read with him in them I end up loving the guy, makes me wonder why...

Apart from the gods, I really like even if I want to punch him when he starts with the talk! But apart from that he's really brave and funny for a twelve years old kid.
is okay. She's a little too arrogant sometimes.
I also like he's really funny and loyal!

Another of my favourites is Percy's mom! She's the best. One of the best mom's from books without any doubt!

Now, I'm ready to the second book! I'm planning on reading all 5 books in the next couple of weeks. Let's see how it goes"

My Review


So the story is about a teenage boy who discovered that he's a Demi-God and he has to attend a Half-Blood school to know more about himself. .

The plot talks about but in a funny way. which made me read more and more! And also it has !!
I loved all the characters in this book, the chemistry between them was delightful and vivid.
The Narrating was so easy and enjoyable. Each scene described in this book was so real, I visualized each event happened in this book, it felt like watching a movie.
and what I loved more was the knowledge about the Greek Myth. I learned so much while reading it.

If you love Greek Mythology, Just read this book!!!

To summarize:"
299,300,5,"Incredible! I now understand the hype surrounding these books and I wish I could've read them when I was younger. I've always been interested in Greek Mythology so it was great to read a book entirely focused on the subject. The concept is great! Sign me up for Camp Half-Blood!!!

I loved the fast pace; there was never any drag and it was so hard to put the book down. All the characters were great; Grover, Anabeth, Percy, Luke and all the gods!

My only negative was towards the end when the bad guys described their evil plans. It's a good way for readers to learn the whole story, but it feels so forced and ultimately unrealistic. I understand why it needed to be explained to the audience but it's such a big pet peeves for mine.

I'm excited to continue reading the series. I stayed away from this series for a while because it was directed toward children but I honestly think it's a series that can cross many age groups.

Highly recommend to anyone who's interested!"

In all seriousness though, I’d been really wanting to pick this up for weeks now and I’m glad I’ve finally gotten to it. This world just makes me feel relaxed and at home and I was a little stressed and nostalgic. So, thanks Riordan. Again.

Also, let’s all just take a moment to appreaciate Percy’s sass and Rick Riordan’s ability to come up with the best chapter titles. Thank you!

rereading this was, once again, the best decision and I loved rereading this so much and I do have the time to reread the series now!!! sadly I have to wait like a month for the audiobook of the 2nd book to arrive from the library. yes, I'm very sad about it.

Reread: OHMYGOD I LOVED THIS SO MUCH! Rereading this might be the best decision I've made this month. Being back in this world with my favorite bookish characters was so great, and definitely made this month a little brighter.
However, the downside is that I now want to reread all the Percy Jackson books, but I definitely don't have the time :'(

320,321,5,"5 STARS FOR ""PERCY JACKSON"" SERIES BY RICK RIORDAN

**I'll be reviewing this series as a whole, not just this first book. No major spoilers included, but there will be some minor ones because of the character discussion. ALSO, THIS IS A LONG REVIEW. So, just a heads up.

“What if it lines up like it did in the Trojan War ... Athena versus Poseidon?""
""I don't know. But I just know that I'll be fighting next to you.""
""Why?""
""Because you're my friend, Seaweed Brain. Any more stupid questions?”




I know what y'all are thinking. ""Rachel, you read this all the way back in sixth grade. What are you doing rating and talking about it now? Especially since the series is over now?"" , my friends, I'm doing this because like how Harry Potter inspired so many to read, Percy Jackson had the same impact on me as a kid. As much as I absolutely devoured and (still!) adore Harry Potter, Percy Jackson was my first ""wow, I should really start reading regularly"" moment.

I grew up alongside Percy, Annabeth, Grover and their friends at Camp Half-Blood. I, to this day, cite this series as one of my favourites of all time. I recommend it to everyone - of all ages. Of either gender. These characters have had such a big impact on my life. Inside of this series you find such strong, loyal, characters that you are able to empathize and root for. While there is a bit of romance found in later books,

Not only did Rick Riordan spark my passion of reading, but he introduced me to my strong interest in Greek mythology.





At the very beginning of the series, we are introduced to a twelve-year-old boy named Percy Jackson who lives with his mother and his abusive step-father, ""Smelly"" Gabe. Abandoned at birth by his biological father, Percy is unaware of his mythological roots and the fact that he is in fact a son of Poseidon.

He's witty and snarky, at times when he shouldn't be (i.e. angering the gods he needs help from). Percy, in the earlier books, is also understandably awkward. His voice is so real and believable as a young boy. A voice this authentic and entertaining is such a rare find nowadays.









Percy is also an extremely relatable and identifiable character. With all of his self-deprecating humor, He's failing all of his classes due to his ADHD and dyslexia (and actually believes that he is dumb), lives with an abusive asshole of a step-father, and has no real friends aside from Grover. Percy has trouble with authority. He even has a complex relationship with Poseidon: while he still has some bitterness towards how the gods abandon their children, Percy still wants Poseidon to be proud of him.

Percy's fatal flaw is loyalty, meaning that He travels to the Underworld to retrieve his mother when she is captured by a Minotaur, and around the world to save Annabeth. He would gladly sacrifice his own life if it meant protecting his friends. Plus, how cute is it that Percy is a momma's boy? The kind of guy who truly loves and respect his mom, and is open about it?

Let's not forget to mention Annabeth Chase, one of my fictional heroes. She is not just relegated to Percy's potential love interest, or some pretty girl that can sometimes be useful to the team. Annabeth is . But Annabeth is a bit jaded in the beginning, as well. Annabeth can be just as lost as Percy is. Annabeth's just looking for a little structure in her life, something permanent.




She doesn't have a close relationship with her dad, and not a good one at all with her step-mother. The two people she considered her true family (excluding Grover, and before Percy came along) either died
or fought on the side of their main enemy, Kronos
. When she loves someone, she loves them with her whole being.




I feel like some people overlook a major fact in Annabeth's actions in the fourth book, The Battle of the Labyrinth. By around that time, it's pretty clear to the reader that she has a crush on Percy. But hey, so does this new girl named Rachel Elizabeth Dare, who's accompanying them on this mission. Annabeth's mission, her first time leading one. While she was also jealous because of Rachel's crush on Percy, the fact of the matter is that Annabeth felt threatened by Rachel's presence. Annabeth is loyal to her friends, but it requires a lot of trust to get her friendship.




The whole cast help to really create this world, and you build a real connection and admiration for each one. There's Percy's mom, Sally, who stays with her jerk of a husband in the first book because she wants to protect her son from monsters. There's Luke, who's easy to pass off as a villian, but is truly just a lost kid who feels so much bitterness and resentment towards Hermes for not acknowledging him. Luke, who took in a runaway Annabeth and Thalia until all three reached Camp Half-Blood. Grover, who with all of his enchilada jokes, actually experiences a lot of mockery and exclusion from his peers and feels immense guilt for not being able to save Thalia. Clarisse, who is seen as a bully and you later see how protective she is of her friends and her eventual respect for Percy. Silena Beauregard who shows that beauty is not just on the outside.







I can't wrap up this review without mentioning one of my favourite literary couples of all time, Percy and Annabeth. What makes their relationship so beautiful is the fact that it does not, unlike most YA books, happen immediately. There are a few hints and implications in the first three books, but nothing major happens until the fourth (and even then they don't get together until near the end of the final one). Percy and Annabeth's romance is founded on years of trust and friendship. They know each other better than they know themselves. They acknowledge each others flaws and imperfections. Neither are perfect, but and they are there for each other no matter what happens.



They trust each other so much that . That's love, y'all. And they have great banter and an amazing dynamic.

Percy acknowledges how smart she is, guys, and doesn't hold her back from going into battle. THIS IS A FEMINIST RELATIONSHIP, GUYS. They respect each other 100%.

It is so satisfying to watch as Percy grows from this fumbling, awkward Percy Jackson to a more confident hero (who of course frustrates Annabeth with how clueless he is when it comes to how she feels about him).

The Percy Jackson series is an absolute classic and a must-read for all. The characters are real and authentic, and not without their flaws. Great themes of family, friendship, romance, identity, prejudice (book two), selflessness, loyalty, and identity. One of my favourites of all time."
321,322,5,"4.5 stars

I feel like a lot of readers have a YA or middle grade series that made them fall in love with reading, and this is one of them for me. This book just brought me so much pure joy, I couldn't stop smiling as I was turning the pages. Not sure I'll say anything groundbreaking in this review, this book/series is iconic for a reason. Endearing characters (forgot how much I love Grover!), all the Greek myth goodies your heart could ever desire, great pacing, fun action, lots of heart, and an ending that feels settled but also leaves so much room to grow. Somehow this book both fed my inner child and held up remarkably well to my current reading tastes. Rick Riordan, you will always be famous.

Revisiting these characters was one of the best reading experiences I've had this year, and I'm so excited to slowly rekindle my Rick Riordan obsession right before the TV show comes out!"

324,325,5,"This book is so refreshing. It’s so funny and the narrator, Percy is just impossible to dislike. This book was my first exposure to Greek mythology. Before I knew Percy Jackson, I had never interested to Greek myth. Lots of tragedies and odd stories. But Rick Riordan had turned those tragedies into something fun and wonderful.
Percy Jackson was just a troubled kid with dyslexia and ADHD (Attention-Deficit and Hyperactivity Disease). What he didn’t know was that he’s a half-blood son of the Greek sea god, Poseidon. When Zeus’ lightning bolt went missing and Poseidon claimed Percy as his son despite of the oath made by the Big Three gods (Zeus, Poseidon and Hades) about sixty years earlier to never have anymore half-blood children, Zeus automatically blame Percy because the theft could only be done by a half-blood. Percy then was sent on an impossible mission to retrieve the bolt before Zeus and Poseidon declared a war with his satir friend and protector, Grover and Annabeth, a half-blood daughter of Athena who’s hungry for adventures.
Some of the adventures in this book are from the actual stories like when Percy behead Medusa’s head like the real Perseus did. It’s fun to think of those magical world hidden in our modern world. And the way Percy described the gods and their ridiculous egos is hilarious. There’re scary things in the adventures but Percy always able to make it sounds fun.

There’s not much god-demigod interactions in this book (though I think it’s still more than other books in this series) but I really love Percy and Poseidon’s interactions here. How Percy, though seemingly resent his father for ignoring him, actually loves him and wants to make him proud. I think they’re sweet as father and son.


Poseidon was funny too, much like Percy. I think Percy got his sense of humor from his father.


This book may not the best book ever written, but it made me laugh throughout the story and it made me know Greek myth a lot easier and fun."
325,326,5,"Wow! What a fun ride. For those who have been following my reviews for a while, they know that I love any books that incorporate Greek mythology into them. Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series has that in spades.

Percy is 12 years old and after a disastrous year at his boarding school is expelled again. Percy has trouble concentrating, and is dyslexic and finds school more trouble than it's worth. Though he has his friend Grover there, Percy is almost relieved to return home again even though that means he is going to have to deal with his stepfather ""Smelly Gabe."" Though Percy doesn't realize it, he's also about to go on an epic adventure.

Percy is a thoughtful and resourceful kid. When we first meet him we start to realize just like he does, that something with him seems off. When he starts to overhear conversations he should not, he realizes that something out there seems to be focusing on him. When Percy returns home, he and his mother go off on a trip leaving Smelly Gabe behind. While out, they are attacked and Percy's true heritage comes out.

I thought Percy and all of the other characters were done wonderfully. Percy's mother is not in this one much, but the woman does pack a punch we see. The characters of Annabeth and Grover were great too. I was so sad at the end when we had Grover off on another adventure.

I thought the writing was so good. I loved how Rick Riordan set up the world building in this story. Nothing was complicated and I loved how there were callbacks to the Greek myths throughout this whole book. Heck I wanted to read more and more about this world and can't wait to read book #2.

The flow was great, as was the action, there is not too much information thrown at you as you read so I didn't feel like I was giving information dumps along the way.

The setting of a familiar world mixed in with Greek gods and goddesses was great. I also liked how Rick Riordan explains how the gods and goddesses move on from land to land.

The ending was definitely one for the books. I was not calling what happened at all (which was nice) but now I am wondering what the future holds for Percy who I don't think is going to be able to fully turn his back on what he now knows about one of his parents."

En ésta primera entrega de la saga de Percy Jackson nos cuenta como éste niño de 12 años que tiene dificultades para leer y problemas de atención descubre que es más especial que TODOS sus compañeros de la escuela. No solo por rostizar a su maestra o aguantar a su exasperante y obeso padrastro, sino que descubrimos que todas las cosas contadas por su maestro de Historia son REALES y que Percy será parte de ellas muy pronto ya que El Olimpo está a punto de presenciar el inicio de una guerra por un artículo ROBADO. Y así es como Rick Riordan alrededor de todo este libro nos cuenta la historia del niño de cabello negro y ojos verdes que fue capaz de obtener una porción de respeto entre los dioses.

No tengo palabras suficientes para expresar lo feliz que me he sentido en cada una de éstas páginas, he vuelto a sido SENTIRME UNA NIÑA nuevamente con este trío dinámico que adoro y tengo que reconocerlo... MÁS QUE HARRY POTTER.
Amé conocer a Annabeth, decidida y valiente en cada una de sus acciones aunque un tanto orgullosa al inicio por ser fiel a su madre. Saber de sátiros fue mi hobby en este libro.
Conocer más de estos choques alrededor de la historia entre los dioses y semidioses, aunque saber del Campamento Mestizo fue INSTA LOVE.

Pero volviendo a hablar más a fondo de la trama creo que el autor hace de este inicio de saga muy fácil de digerir, está súper sencillo de avanzar puesto que la explicación que nos dan de cada acción pasada es lo suficiente para poder proseguir con la historia sin perderte.
Hablando de la línea de tiempo entre cada escena estuvo súper acertada, no sentí forzada ninguna de ellas y creo que eso hace que el lector se entretenga y disfrute de la lectura sin la frase ""Fue muy ventajoso que esto sucediera"" pero sigamos con el tener que RELEER CAPÍTULOS para volver a imaginar las distintas ambientaciones porque eran embelesadoras, lamento si es repetitivo pero me encantó que Rick haya sido minucioso con cada detalle al escribir.
Creo que recomendaré tanto este libro a mis sobrinos que se aburrirán de mí pero siento que todos necesitamos una historia como ésta. La del niño que se convirtió en héroe o aún intenta serlo."

It was about time for me to start this amazing series. All the hype
about the spin-off series is what got me really interested in finally reading this book and I am glad I did. This series looks like it's going to be truly amazing. It gives a spark that I was missing since Harry Potter.

The Lighting Thief is the first book in the pentalogy of Percy Jackson and the Olympians and it introduces us to Percy and the world of Half-bloods. And it's truly an amazing world, filled with Greek gods and mythology, I enjoyed every single part of it. Percy lives his life unaware of what he truly is, half-human half-god, he is the son of Poseidon. His mother has managed to successfully hide him amongst mortals for the first 12 years of his life but Percy is getting in the gods radar really fast. In order to protect him, his mother leads him to Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for half-gods. But Zeus is reigning a war against Poseidon and it's because everyone things that Percy stole his Lighting Bolt. So Percy will go on a quest to find the bolt and return it to Zeus before life as we know it comes to an end.

Where to begin? Percy, Annabeth and Grover are the perfect trio for a quest. They are so different and such unique characters that you can't help but love them. I also loved the gods and their human ways. It was fun to see them acting like actual people. Also I loved camp half-blood, that place was amazing, I wish there was more of it in the book. Also I really liked Luke, and even though I've watched the movie and knew the truth about him, my heart broke at the end.

All in all, I loved this book and the story and I already started the second one and bought all the rest of the series. I can't wait to spend more time in Percy's world. So glad there is a spin-off too, which means more half-bloods' adventures."
328,329,5,"Bueno, realmente me arrepiento de haber empezado a leer estos libros ahora.

Gracias a ellos, estoy aprendiendo muchas cosas sobre la mitología Griega, y me está interesando hasta puntos bastante importantes.

Había visto el revuelo que causó esta saga, especialmente cuando la película se iba a estrenar, por ser especialmente, protagonista Logan Lerman. Imaginé que debían estar exagerando (tal y como pasó con 50 Shades of Grey, The Hunger Games, The Perks of Being a Wallflower...), y decidí dejarlo pasar.

Pero dentro de unos días se estrena la segunda película, y viendo el trailer de la primera (que aún no he visto), decidí leerme los libros, a ver por qué tanta emoción.

Y los entendí a todos.

No sólo son libros cortos que te atrapan, y dejas de lado el tiempo mientras lees, sino que son fáciles de entender, con una narrativa fácil, y eso es una de las cosas que más me han gustado y me han hecho empezar a leerme el segundo nada más terminar el primero.

Nunca me había llamado la atención la mitología griega. Lo tenía como un tema ""rollo"", algo que estaba fuera de mi interés. Pero leyendo estos libros, le he dado una nueva oportunidad, porque he visto que tiene cosas bastante interesantes.

A todo esto, ¿soy la única que prefiere llamar Perseus al protagonista? Me resulta más... no sé explicarme.

Creo que mi parte favorita de todo el libro fue cuando, en el Campamento Mestizo, al final de uno de los capítulos, tú misma descubres que Percy es hijo de Poseidón.

Harto recomendable esta saga, y sin duda, me haré con la saga entera en papel, y no en ebook, como la estoy leyendo."

*cries to bring on the monsters*
ok...i don't even know where to start.
i've been meaning to reread this for awhile now, for many reasons. getting into the musical, the show coming soon, etc. i had a great time rereading this book. i didn't expect how much this book felt like coming home. i felt so nostalgic for something i didn't have. i cried relistening to the musical while/after reading haha (i'm very emotional don't judge).
i didn't realize how much percy and annabeth were comfort characters for me. grover not as much, but that does not mean i don't love him bc i do. percy's humor is just so good, and he's one of my favorite main characters ever. he is so relatable (humor as a coping mechanism gang), and i could gush about him for forever but that would get annoying so uhh moving along.
miss annabeth. you had ZERO right to hit as close to home as you did. i just love her character so freaking much, and i want to be her more than any other character. i can't even put it into words how much i love her character honestly, i can't properly express it.
i highlighted 91 things during my reread (song lyrics, percabeth, foreshadowing, humor, etc) and i had so much fun doing so.

331,332,5,"Percy Jackson tries to be good, but circumstances just don't allow him to be. Trouble always seems to find him. Let's not talk about what happens to his math teacher his sixth grade year... At the end of sixth grade, Percy and his mom take off for a trip to the beach. Late in the night, it sounds like a hurricane blows up and they're running for their lives. Percy winds up at Half-Blood Hill, a summer camp for the children of...Greek gods? An evil plot is afoot and Percy needs to clear his name and unravel the mystery with the help of his two friends, Annabeth and Grover.

I loved this! I've always enjoyed mythology and this was an original take on the old myths for children. But don't think it's only for children--adults will enjoy it too. Percy, Annabeth and Grover are fantastic, smart, fun characters. I loved reading about how the toga-wearing Greek gods from my school days have morphed to fit into the twentieth century. (Is anyone really surprised that Ares rides a chopper?) The mystery kept me guessing and the action was just right.

I highly recommend this for kids and adults who aren't afraid to read children's books. I'll be reading the rest of the series."

Rewritten review

This is an absolute beauty of a book.

In just a small book, Riordan has created a world to be totally envious of; a world in which thousands, possibly millions of people want to live in. Young adults all over the world wish that they were a half blood just for the possibility of Camp Half Blood.

This book kept me up so many nights, devouring every beautiful word that Riordan has written. l could not get enough of this beautiful world. This is a stunning young adult book that is one of the best of the fantasy genre. The world that Riordan has created is just absolutely stunning.

I loved the characters in this and I can't even explain how much I love nearly every single character. I love that it's from Percy's point of view and we get to see things from the perspective of things happening. I've read too many books that are third person so this was a wonder to read and to remember.

I fully recommend the Percy Jackson series. It is absolutely wonderful and I can't wait to finish this series off."
333,334,5,"5 star rating
This book is literally the best , I love this book and this has become a favourite since i have actually gone into the PJO and HOO fandom (Percy Jackson and the Olympians and Heroes of Olympus).
“The real world is where the monsters are.”
This one line practically explains the whole book.
Minotaurs, cyclops, dragons, harpies, hell hounds - saying these and thinking that I'm probably mad , well to go into the Percy Jackson world, into Camp Half Blood, I would claim I am mad.
Anyway-Let's talk about the hero of our story_Percy Jackson- I guess the title of the book covers that quite well, but you see, I had to mention. So he thinks he is just a normal kid, playing basketball and skateboarding. Has ADHD and dyslexia until he uncovers truths about himself and is sent to a special camp for only kids of his type. New kid, new place , new friends.. and now he is sent on a quest blamed for having stolen something that our dear little Percy had no idea about.
Read the book online or with a physical copy to enjoy this thrilling series' first book.

Mi rivolgo a voi, gente che ha visto i due film di Percy e che non ha letto i libri: AVETE VISTO UN'ALTRA STORIA.
Il libro non ha niente a che fare con il film e il film non ha niente a che fare con il libro, già partendo dal fatto che i protagonisti del libro hanno 12 anni mentre quelli del film hanno la patente (?)
Questo primo libro della serie mi è piaciuto tanto, non è mai noioso e gestisce bene le situazioni in cui domina l'azione. Non mi sono stancata un attimo di leggere di nuovi dettagli, non ero tentata di saltare nessuna pagina, il libro non era mai pesante.
Annabeth è uno dei miei personaggi preferiti ♥♥♥ e sono sicura che la amerete tutti.

“Even strength must bow to wisdom sometimes.”― Rick Riordan, The Lightning Thief

Even a decade later, Percy Jackson and the Olympians remains one of my all-time favorites! Revisiting Camp Half-Blood and being reintroduced to some of my favorite characters to ever exist: my heart is so full.

The humor continues to be funny, the pop culture references iconic (if somewhat dated but let me have this nostalgia), and the adventures are awesome. The antics Percy and co. get into remind me of being eleven again and desperately wanting to be a demigod, even though I was sure I wouldn't make it a week in Percy's world.

This just makes me so happy!!

For a start, the chapter titles cracked me up!

I also loved each of the characters and just the absolute craziness of everything that was going on. The myths have been woven into the story really well and I was also pretty pleased with the explanation for how normal people (mortals) rationalise all the crazy stuff that goes on in front of them.

My favourite part of the book, for those who know it well, was ""EAT MY PANTS!"" 😂

354,355,5,"I love you Percy Jackson! It's just so beautiful

Question: Is it sad that one of my favorite books is also a book for kids in grade 3?

Answer: No way in Hades!

I'd love to write a long-winded, amazing, blow-your-socks-off review. But I can't. I can't write a review that will do this book justice. That's how amazing this book is, if it can make shut up for a change!

But alas, who am I to not try?





Percy Jackson (right in the title) is not only the main character but my favorite character! He was definitely the most kick-ass out of all them, funny and just down-right hot.

When writing in first person, the character must be likable. If I don't like your character, I'm not reading the book. Percy is the best narrarator anyone could ask for. He is funny, cute and real. Yes, he is . We can relate to Percy, after all, he is half human (we can ignore that half-god part for a while).

I really enjoyed his character. He spoke like a 13-year-old boy which is good because that is who he is meant to be. He doesn't rush into 'hero-mode', like some books I have read. His slow progression is what makes the book more realistic and also, less cliche.

My favourite Percy quote:

All the other characters were written perfectly and stayed true to their age and circumstance. Annabeth was another one of my favourite characters. She reminded me of myself: smart, sarcastic and reluctant to let others in. Very nicely developed and her arguments with Percy were enjoyable but I did enjoy their friendship. Grover was a hilarious side-kick and I now love satyrs

Even the gods of Olympus managed to be written in the way I envisioned them to be. I have no idea how Rick Riordan managed to create such characters, as if he went inside my mind and took the ideas right out of it. Amazing!





Don't worry, this isn't the Twilight saga, so for those of you who cannot stand romance, there isn't an overwhelming amount. In the first book, Percy and Annabeth strongly dislike each other and through their quest do not fall helplessly in love with each other, but they do become friends (which is the first step to a healthy relationship!)

There weren't any ""I love you"" or ""No, I love you more"" in this book. But their arguments, you could tell, had tension wrapped with them.









See what I mean? Throughout this whole series, there isn't a lot of mush. The main genre in this novel is humor and action. But, if you are a die-hard romantic like moi, you may find yourself loving ""Percabeth""!




Did I really just skip the plot? Oopsy! Well, if you have been reading other reviews, the blurb on the book (or even on the site) then you'll already have a brief idea of what this book is about. But let's sum it real quick shall we:

Percy: Hi! I'm a half-blood and I like blue food and guess what? It seems like everyone in this whole camp thinks I stole the ""master bolt"" (even though I think it just looks like a neon glow stick) from Zeus. So now I'm stuck on this quest to go get it. This sucks.

Annabeth: I cannot believe someone of my superior intelligence is stuck on a quest with an imbecile like Percy Jackson. Son of Posedians and daughters of Athena do not get a like. But this is my only chance to be on a quest so I'll take what I get, even if it means fighting Medusa.

Grover: I don't wanna go. But I can't leave Percy alone, he's my best friend and I am his protector. Ugh! Why can't I just play my pipes and find Pam (which is NOT a kitchen spray) and do things non-satyrs do. I'm just going to go and eat the furniture.

And that's the plot! Just kidding. But I think you get the gist of it, they go on a quest to retrieve Zeus's master bolt and have to face all kinds of crazy things.

I thought the idea was pure genius. I have never read a book that focused on greek mythology, aimed at kids and also was likable! It was a unique concept and played out perfectly! The setting, Camp Half-blood was fully developed and I could imagine myself there right now. All the characters, even the minor ones, were able to imprint themselves into my mind. The plot was kept at a good pace and I did not find a page that was boring.


Percy Jackson and the Olympains is a 5-book series. The Lightening Theif is the first of the 5. Let me forewarn you, as soon as you read from Percy's perspective, no other perspectives will compare.

You NEED the entire series! It practically killed me to wait a month for that last book because someone decided to check it out in the library and keep it long overdue!

The books will suck you in and take you for a journey that I only wish I was apart of.


Don't even get me started! The movie didn't even follow the storyline of the book and even Logan Lerman's drop-dead good looks couldn't get me to watch the movie again. It was a tragedy, that a book good could be ruined in a movie.

One of my good friends has never read the books but she has seen the movie and thought it was fantastic. I wanted to dump my popcorn on her head. I'm not going to rant for that much longer, but newsflash! Annabeth is blonde!










Enough of my movie rant, let's just say the book was better (even if it didn't have Logan Lerman).


Yes, there are similarities between Percy Jackson and Harry Potter. But c'mon! Harry Potter is about wizards and magic and the purpose of those novels is to defeat the-one-who-shall-not-be-named. And Percy Jackson is about greek gods and battle and to defeat Kronis.

Percy Jackson is more for younger readers. It's main genres are action/adventure/humor instead of magic!

And for those of you who insist on not reading this book, fine! But please, do not encourage others to do the same because this book is actually really good.

I believe it is a best-seller. Let me check. I'm right.



Loved the idea, loved the plot, loved the characters ...

Loved everything!

You gotta read this book, or I read that the Empousas will come from the Underworld to getcha!"
355,356,5,"Wowwww, I really REALLY LOVED this!!
From the start, the plot was so compelling. It literally started with Percy's teacher turning into vapor. Like what a way to start off a story! And since Percy had like no idea what was happening, I felt like I was learning with him and it was so interesting! I never thought I'd be interested in Greek mythology because every time I went to the museum, I never really cared to read the descriptions under the statues, but now that I know more about it, I just want to learn more.

And, my god, I couldn't get enough of the characters. Percy, Annabeth and Grover already have a special place in my heart. Percy is so loyal, Annabeth is funny without even realizing it and Grover is just a lil CINNAMON ROLL, I want him to be my protector, xD.

359,360,5,"I just saw it, Rick’s video. Believe me when I say that I screamed and then I cried, because PJO is getting it’s own Disney+ Series.


Do you know this man?


In 2010, this man tried to pass himself off as 12 year old Percy Jackson, but this man is not Percy Jackson.

Peter Johnson, gutted many hardcore PJO fans such as myself when he turned their beloved Percy Jackson series into a teen drama not even fit for the CW. It is suffice to say that I’ve carried the hurt caused by Peter Johnson in my heart for nearly a decade now.

In all honesty, I do love Logan Lerman. I think he’s a great actor, and I think he was great Percy for maybe book 5, but he was supposed to be 12 in the first movie. And there were soooooo many discrepancies that I couldn’t stand it.

This series may be just what us fans need. The chance to right all wrongs. Yay! Please don’t F this up Disney.




Just reread the entire series once again. I do that, every 6 or 7 months or so. Percy Jackson has a special place in my heart, one he shares with Harry Potter. People like to compare this to HP by Rowling, but it honestly couldn't be more different. I was 14 when I first read the lightening thief, I bought the book after watching the first movie. These books are masterpieces. The movies weren't able to pull off their greatness, they changed way too much. A part of me always hopes they will remake the PJ movies, or make a series, but in my mind Logan Lerman is stuck as Percy. This book has everything, humour, action, romance (suitable for the kiddies). Everyone should read these books at least once in their lives. One day when I get married and have kids of my own, I'll definitely make sure they are introduced to the great world of Percy Jackson, because no one should miss out on that chance."

Why is world-building so good?
It's simple yet magical. Greek gods are real, and they have children with mortal human beings called the Demigods. Greek mythological creatures exist too. Camp Half-Blood is where the demigods reside. The campers are divided among cabins accordingly to their Godly Parent. It's a safe place and an adventuresome summer camp. There are deadly quests and engrossing prophecies, yet it's not a perfect world.


It is the best first-person narrative ever.
Percy's not whiny. He is incredible, fun, and humorous.


Every character has such depth. It blows my mind away. 🥺🤯


▫️ Demigods are dyslexic and ADHD. Percy was Uncle Rick's way of telling his son, who has Dyslexia and ADHD.
▫️ Grover stands for protecting the environment. Henceforth a great message is delivered because while reading, people empathize and adapt the emotion behind it.
▫️Uncle Rick gave us characters like Nancy Bobofit and Gabe Ugliano to trash talk.
▫️ The trio : 👧🏼👦🏻🐐
▫️ Annabeth and Percy. I already knew they are soulmates. Even thirteen years me knew that 🤷🏻‍♀️.


The first time I read this book was six years ago when I was thirteen. Percy is like an old pal. I didn't think I would enjoy it so much when I am 'not into middle-grade books'.
I enjoyed reading it so much more. I could see after reading so many books from so many different genres it still outshines. Yes. It is that good.

Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief holds a special place in my heart. It was the first book I bought and read at my will. It's a classic and is one of my favorites PERIOD

5/5 (It's the best)

I am so excited for rest of the parts!"
361,362,5,"“My name is Percy Jackson.
I'm twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy, a private school for troubled kids in upstate New York.
Am I a troubled kid?
Yeah. You could say that.”

I forgot how much I loved this book.
I first read The Lightning Thief a while ago. (To be exact, almost seven years ago. )
I loved it, and I really wanted to continue on with the series, but too much time passed between finishing this and starting The Sea of Monsters, so I wasn't really on top of the plot anymore, which is why I gradually gave up on it.

Percy Jackson is just so special and funny and interesting. I remember being really interested in Greek Mythology after reading this, which is still the case after all these years (would you just look at my love for , yes, thank you.)

Rick Riordan simply does such a great job at making these Gods human and putting their character traits and abilities into something relatable, while still keeping them the beings they are. Even their looks in Human Form made me smile while reading.

The over all were super hilarious and likable, and the combination of this Greek Mythology coming to life and how the people come to terms with and 'treat' that knowledge is funny to watch from Percy's perspective, who is just as new to all of this as the reader.

As I have already read this, I already knew how the story would turn out in the end and what the prophecy really meant, but I remember not guessing the twist the first time around, so that was great. I like being surprised by books, and this one does surprise. Also, there was always something going on, so not once did I find myself being bored.

I am very excited to finally continue on with this series!"
362,363,5,"“But I’m not normal,” I said.

“You say that as if it’s a bad thing, Percy. But you don’t realize how important you are.”


You’re important to me, Percy, don’t worry.

Take this review as someone who isn't the target audience, whatever that means at this point. This review was written by a 22 y/o who finally reread this book because news broke out about Walker Scobell being casted for the show. He will be amazing. I already know it. It should be noted that the same 22 y/o first read the books when she was 20.

Moral of the story, I read this series as an adult and it's one of my favourites of all time. It holds a special place in my head and heart. The smiles on my face this time around were as if I was reading it all for the first time again.

I am not a big fantasy reader. I always find that fantasy books have too much info-dumping for my taste. But I have a love for Greek myths and Riordan created a well-balanced fusion of the myths in the modern world with a fast-paced adventure that worked really well for me. Camp Half-Blood was a beautiful and enchanting place that I freaking wish was real. The gods in this book as well as the other mythical creatures were fascinating and well-incorporated in this world.

I can sit here all day and talk about the characters but it's nearing 3 AM as I'm typing this review. With the wonderful setting and plot came even better and loveable characters. Percy is one of my favourite narrators of all time. He was so funny and quick-witted, clever, juvenile yet mature about some of the darker aspects of his life. I've genuinely laughed out loud at some of his dialogue and remarks. His interactions with Grover and Annabeth were so wholesome and hilarious.

A beautiful start to a beautiful series."

Ik leerde Percy kennen, en las over zijn thuis situatie en hoe lastig hij het heeft. Ondanks hetgeen wat hij heeft meegemaakt, wist hij direct mijn hart te stelen.

Percy Jackson komt over als een hele lieve jongen en het liefst wil je hem dan ook helpen bij wat hij doormaakt. Ondanks dat hij overkomt als een lieverd, vecht hij wel voor hetgeen waar hij in geloofd, waardoor hij ook zeker mijn respect verdiende. Dit personage nestelte zich in mijn hart en zorgde ervoor dat het verhaal enorm meeslepend was voor mij.

De andere personages in dit verhaal vond ik ook zeker interessant om over te lezen. De belangrijkste personages krijgen zeer duidelijke karaktereigenschappen waardoor ze allemaal op hun eigen manier uniek en aantrekkelijk voor mij zijn om over te lezen. Ze passen ook perfect in het verhaal.

Uiteraard is Percy favoriet, maar zijn vriend Grover, is zeker mijn een tweede favoriet, vanwege zijn moed en aandoenlijke gedrag.


Dit was een boek waar ik doorheen vloog. De zinnen liepen soepel over in elkaar en er zit genoeg mysterie in verwerkt waardoor het boek de gehele tijd interessant blijft.

Er zit ook een heerlijke dosis humor in, waardoor ik regelmatig hardop moet lachen vanwege de grappige situaties.

Het einde van het verhaal was vrij voorspelbaar. Het is echter een young adult boek, waardoor dit niet perse een minpunt is. Het einde van het boek vond ik dus een fijne afsluiting voor dit verhaal.

Je weet echter dat er meerdere delen zijn in deze serie, waardoor je maar al te graag verder wilt met deel twee, De Zee van Monsters, om erachter te komen wat Percy en zijn vrienden dan mee gaan maken.
Een aanrader voor iedereen die van Griekse Goden, mythologie en spanning houdt!"
364,365,5,"Edit (2017): I don't know what possessed me to give this book only three stars when I first read it, but while rereading it and after reading all of Rick Riordan's book, The Lightning Thief definitely deserves at least five stars! I just love Percy Jackson and the world Riordan has built with these books, and this book is what started it all.

Can't wait to reread the rest of this series and then dive into the Heroes of Olympus once again, because it's been too long since I've read those, too!

///////////////////////////////

I will tell you right now, I am rubbish at writing reviews, but I am going to try my best to make it into a 'proper' review. Here we go.

At first, I was a bit sceptical about this book, because when I watched the movie, last month, I both liked and disliked it. The movie felt a bit rushed, and I was afraid that the book might be the same too. But it surprised me a lot. I did miss a couple of important things sometimes, but I guess that's just me - reading way too fast, missing the important pieces of the story. I finished this book within two days, because I really wanted to know what would happen at the end - even though I had already watched the movie (and I found out that the movie was changed in SO many ways). While I read, I started to dislike the movie even more.

I am going to start Sea of Monsters soon, when I've read the books that are on my 'Currently Reading' list. So yeah. Rubbish review, sorry."
365,366,5,"My Favorite Summer Reread! This book always brings back the best nostalgia for me. I am reminded of 12-year-old Shelby growing up with Percy, Annabeth, and Grover, following their adventures and imagining she was right there with them. Percy Jackson is just a kid trying to figure out his place in the world, and I really love and respected that about his character. I also forgot just how much I loved Annabeth's friendship with Percy. They have had such a bond from such a young age, it is always so fun to see their relationship from the beginning to the end.
It is also so fun to see how many easter eggs Rick Riordan implanted in this first book that won't come into play until later in the series. His writing is just so fun, the humor is everything, and nothing will be more iconic than the chapter titles. Im excited to pick up Sea of Monsters next for this Summer 2023 reread!

How could I resist giving this book 5/5? Everything about it made me feel warm and fuzzy 🥰 This coming-of-age story has something in it for everyone. I think everyone can relate to feeling lost and confused at 11, and Rick Riordan did an amazing job using those emotions to create this story. Every single time Annabeth said “Seaweed Brain,” my heart fluttered a bit, and I can’t wait to reread the second book!"
366,367,5,"The Lightning Thief was a phenomenally written and highly educational adventure. The story of Percy Jackson is woven with authentic mythology and when you're reading it, you know you are experiencing something monumental.

It's amazingly creative and extremely detailed. I found myself visualizing every event, setting, god and mythological creature described with ease. Percy's struggles and how he deals with them show an evolution of character that is usually saved for later in a series. From thinking like a human in denial to becoming the confident demigod he's destined to be, the progression is nothing short of spellbinding.

Rick Riordan has a way of hinting at a characters true identity before revealing it that allows older readers to guess who the character might be. I found this to be great fun as it allowed me to utilize some of my high school mythology lessons I once thought to be long forgotten.

I was hooked in the first ten pages and could not drag myself away from the story. Percy Jackson and the Olympians appears to be almost overqualified to fill the void left in the middle grade fantasy genre created by the ending of the Harry Potter series. This is a series everyone, young and old, should experience. Definitely not to be missed."
367,368,5,"""When do you become too old from a book?""

A few months ago, my newfound friend proposed we share our favorite books with each other. I told him to read the Percy Jackson series, and he gave me the The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. (I still have not gone past book 1 ._.) Anyway, after he read the first book, he got back to me and said it was too childish. I took this and wondered ""Would I like PJO if I had started in 2017?"" I still don't know my answer.

PJO is a series I am very fond of. I grew up reading Percy Jackson's journey. I started this series back in 2006 when my teacher read the first few chapters one day. I remember thinking it was really funny and wait to continue the next week (I don't even think we continued), so I took the copy I had home with me and finished reading.

This book is such a delightful read for age :)"
368,369,5,"This was like the billionth reread I’ve done of this book, and it never ceases to amaze me how absolutely brilliant it is. Percy is that one-in-a-million character. A boy dealt the worst hand, and yet he still managed to turn it into gold. His unwavering loyalty to his friends, his deep-seated adoration for his mother, his bravery and wit and genius snark build him up into this unattainable figure of perfection. He is both one of the most realistic and unrealistic characters out there. He’s at times selfish and quick tempered, sharp with his tongue and his judgments. But his heart is so large and free, and his honor is greatly admirable. An absolute gem, there will never be a fictional character that will ever come even close to touching what Percy Jackson has done for the public consciousness concerning literature. And what he has done for me personally, every since that day I picked up this novel as a small girl with little confidence in her own abilities. I love him with my whole heart, and he will always live inside me"
369,370,5,"Warning! Horrible review to come!
Why can't I be like any other normal person and just set a book down normally after I read it? Wait, I'm not a normal human being. I'm a book hoarder who literally says goodnight to all her books. So, I can't put a book down normally. I was an emotional mess. I mean that ending was wowwwwww. So when the book ended a threw it across the room. Yes, I threw my cousin's very nice book across my bedroom. Why, you may be asking? Well, I was in a horrible state then and there. This amazing book just I was a mix of happiness, but also sadness because I don't have my hands on the second book!

This book was AWESOME! I don’t know how to review this book. Rick Riordan had done a GREAT job indeed! Now I understand why many people LOVE this book! I watched the movie too, but comparing with the book, it’s TOTALLY different. The movie didn’t have the most necessary parts. Now I see why people hate the movie, and LOVE the book. So, do I. I LOVE this book! I actually wanted to believe in this. But the book started like this;
If you're reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal life.
If you haven’t read this book, read it now. No age limits. If you have read it before, don’t forget the book. This book is not a forgetting-type book. Readers of this book will LOVE this."
371,372,5,"This was an enjoyable fantasy. To read about the quest adventurer of Percy to return the lighting bolt to Zeus was thrilling. Of course, he has help from Annabeth another Demi-God from Camp Half-Blood and Grover, the satyr, Percy's best friend who has a desire to earn his Searchers License. All the characters are alive in your mind's eye as you continue to read. Meet the Gods from Olympus. Zeus, Poseidon, Ares, Athena, Hydra, Hermes, Hephaestus, and Aphrodite just to name a few. A quick exciting read. Enjoy.

Quotes:

She wasn't human. She was a shriveled hag with bat wings and claws and mouth full of yellow fangs, and she was about to slice me to ribbons.

But the blade will pass through mortals like an illusion. They simply are not important enough for the blade to kill.

It was SO GOOD, loved the characters and how much witty they can be, the writing style managed to sneak its grip around my eyeballs and super-glue them to the pages.
I wish I had read the book first before watching the movie, which was a very poor book-to-movie-adaptation and did nothing but spoil the ending for me >:(, I like to think of the movies as a separate, independent series than the books.
Over all, I had a very pleasant experience reading and I felt it would have been more pleasant if I had read it when I was younger."

Why do I love the Percy Jackson series?

- Annabeth. Annabeth is amazing and makes this whole series worth it.
- Camp Half-blood is amazing and can I go there PLEASE
- THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF THIS SERIES IS SO AMAZINGLY CREATIVE I CAN'T
- It inspired my younger self to go and read nonfiction and actually research about Greek mythology and Riordan is single-handled the reason why I (and I am sure a lot of readers) suddenly had interent in Greek mythology
- This series is hilarious
- This series is well written
- I will admit that while Annabeth is amazing, Percy and Grover are equally cool too
- There are many more reasons but if you read the books you will discover them for yourself, kay? <3"

I don't regret trying to read this book because it was absolutely wonderful and it kept you on your toes with the journey Percy Jackson goes through. The plot really had me drawn in and I most definitely got caught off guard when it came to the plot twist at the very end of the book! 5 star rating from me and I will be continuing the series for sure!"
375,376,5,"This was my first time reading this, at the age of 25, and honestly it was like starting Harry Potter all over again.

The Percy Jackson series accompanied my childhood and pre-teens and can I just say that this is how you write unproblematic stories and characters? There's absolutely nothing wrong about this series or characters, there're no unnecessary problematics like you see so often in YA books nowadays. Rick Riordan really is a god since I haven't read a single bit of his writing that isn't amazing, funny or exciting. Recommended to everyone."

Percy is such a great character! He seems like just a normal kid and I love that about him. Annabeth and Grover are perfect sidekicks for this adventure and the three make me laugh out loud several times. The villains were also great and I loved the fight scenes a lot! The imagery in this book allowed me to vividly imagine the entire story. I cannot wait to dive into the next book and see what happens to Percy!!"

Percy Jackson is a fantastic character. He is a normal young boy with a learning disability. Or is he? He finds out that he is really a demi-god and the son of Poseidon, but his life is about to get even more complicated when he is accused of stealing Zeus's lightning bolt. I really liked this young man. He is not necessarily the strongest person, but when faced with a God's wrath, he certainly is the bravest!

“I’d love to tell you I had some deep revelation on my way down, that I came to terms with my own mortality, laughed in the face of death, et cetera.

The truth? My only thought was: Aaaaggghhhhh!”











Several years ago, when there was a huge buzz about the Percy Jackson books among my friends, I considered reading the books and joining in the discussions as well. I also stumbled upon copies of the first and fifth books of the series back then. Unfortunately, it was the time when I moved on from the HP craze and spiraled into the ASoIaF frenzy. A time came when I finally got over the ASoIaF fanaticism (albeit many years later) and finally decided to give the Percy Jackson books a try. But I shrugged that idea merely because I assumed I won't enjoy it since I didn't belong to the age group these books catered to. With the live-action streaming series in the works, the compulsive reader within me persistently nudged me to read these books before the series finally premieres.

And here we are now! One book down, and at least four more to go. I confess that I'm a bit disappointed that I missed all the hype and discussions about this series that was prevalent a decade ago, but I'm also glad to read it eventually. As the phrase goes, better late than never. A few days ago, surrounded by an air of melancholy, I was desperate for a feel-good fantasy book and, somehow, this book popped up back on my radar. Looking back, reading this book was the best decision that I had made at that time.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. For that, I was generous enough to leave a high rating for this book. Perhaps, it might seem inflated to some. Comparing it to epic fantasies and books filled with highly complex worlds might be similarly unfair as well. I loved the book because it excels at what it strives to do. It's a great book when one considers it as a middle-grade fantasy book, and it's a perfect gateway book that can draw in new readers and open them to the worlds of fantasy literature.

With its brilliant writing, engaging plot, great character work, and a perfect mixture of modern-day America with Greek myths, the book had me hooked from beginning to end. The humor and the camaraderie contained within its pages were the antidotes that I required during the gloomy and morose days. The book had me take a trip down memory lane reminiscing about Disney's Hercules animated series all the time.

All in all, I loved the first book in Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. Being fast-paced, humorous, and thoroughly exciting, I would highly recommend giving this book a try if you haven't read it yet. I had a fun time reading this book and I'm looking forward to continuing with the series.



I'll also like to add that John Rocco's artwork (in the Illustrated Edition) was stunning and the art elevated the reading experience in a way."
398,399,5,"Releer este libro después de casi 10 años me daba mucho miedo, pues creía que esta ya no sería una lectura para mi yo ""adulta"", pero fue todo lo contrario, solo me hizo recordar porqué amo tanto esta saga y siempre será mi favorita. Se me erizaba la piel en las escenas importantes, reía y gritaba tal como cuando tenía 11-12 años. Me hizo recordar lo mucho que Rick Riordan me inspiró en su momento a escribir, cómo me ayudó a sentirme menos sola en el mundo. Siempre es un gusto reencontrarme con Percy y acompañarlo en sus aventuras junto con Annabeth y Grover. No puedo esperar a esta vez leer absolutamente todos los libros de corrido y reencontrarme con todos los demás personajes."
399,400,5,"One of my favourite books ever.
The humour is really *chef's kiss*. Everything is perfect.

The writers of the films really made this book dirty. I had forgotten but what's with all the amazing scenes that have disappeared ? Most of them build up the rest of the plot... Way too much freedom. Good thing Logan Lerman was there to save what could be saved. Can't wait for Rick Riordan to take charge in the new TV show.


."
400,401,5,"Actual rating: 4.5 stars

Okay, so I am deeply and thoroughly conflicted. At one side, I enjoyed this book so unusually much, I feel like the 5-star rating should be without question. Then again, there were a few major flaws that I cannot possibly overlook, and must address. So, here goes.

First of all: am I ashamed of being so absorbed by a book written for 12-year old boys? The answer - a very resounding . I often read out of my demographic, and the results can be very refreshing. So they were this time, I'm happy to report.


The world the author builds is mesmerizing. As I was basically raised on Greek mythology (I have so many books of it left! I played Hermes in an Odysseus play as a kid! In school we heard a new story every week!) it was fan-fucking-tastic to have all this knowledge flooding back to me. Even better, many of the references to Greek mythology aren't overt - they're subtle and you're left to guess what they mean.

Then there's the characters. While they aren't particularly noteworthy, they're very much fun and have an excellent dynamic between 'em.
Thirdly, I cite the plot. It's convoluted and complex, way more than you'd expect for a book like this.


Not all is well in Rick Riordan's fantasy, however. There's a very unfortunate tendency of Riordan to just you the answer to an unresolved question, undoubtedly a result of him trying to be easy on his readers - but it suggests underestimation of exactly what his audience is capable of.

In the same vein, Riordan sometimes throws in a random solution to a problem - kind of like Tolkien and his eagles - in a way that it comes out of nowhere, and seems not to fit into the plot particularly well. I think the strangest occurrence of this is when Percy & co. come across a poodle in the middle of the woods. Readers of the book will know what I'm talking about.

Lastly, I was sometimes a bit irritated with the small sentences and breakneck pace - but (again), that's easily contributed to the specified age range for this book, and I can forgive it - after having plowed through numerous 800-page epic fantasies, it is a breath of fresh air to get your resolution so quickly.


Thankfully, this comes down to relatively minor parts of the book.

The Underworld. It exists. People go there to be judged and they end up either in a happy place, a neutral place or the Olympian equivalent of Hell. Forever. So I don't remember how this was in Greek mythology, but this very straightforward concept of afterlife is one I definitely hate with a passion. It gives too straight an answer to what happens after death. It is too easy. I don't know why it gets to me so much, but it does! I want death to be ambiguous, so it is more meaningful. Where will be the tension in anticipating the deaths of characters as I continue the series, knowing what will happen to them if they die? Really now.

Then: Luke.
I would just like to have had things fleshed out a bit more. It could have prevented these kinds of problems.

Okay, okay, last thing. I really couldn't let this one go:



Again, while recognizing this book's flaws, my enjoyment of it was simply too big! I was positively giddy with joy. I can't wait to read the next book. This doesn't happen to me often enough, I should say. Therefore, five stars. Now don't think me the book earns it this rating alone - I've liked plenty of terrible stuff, and then not given it high ratings afterwards. No - Percy Jackson is smartly composed, well-built, action-packed, exciting and creative, atop of likable. So there.

(Since the comparison really is inevitable, I'll say this to close the review - no, Percy Jackson is nowhere as refined or brilliant as Harry Potter, though it occasionally comes close. Does that matter? Nah, it's still good, it's just not as intricate as HP. Really, the attention to details is what I believe made Harry Potter a success, and Percy Jackson is sort of lacking in that matter - you often find yourself wanting to know way more than is given to you.)

(Also inevitable: mentioning that trainwreck of a movie they made out of this book. I fully support Grover being black - that's the way I imagine him - just not a black stereotype. And aside from egregiously age lifting the characters, the movie destroys so much of the book's plot I don't think it's even worthy of marginal mention. That's without having addressed the inherent sexism and misogyny in the movie..)

402,403,5,FINALLY STARTED READING PERCY JACKSON!!
403,404,5,"Masterpiece.
Za równo za pierwszym razem jak teraz kiedy zrobiłam reread 🛐"
404,405,5,"I completely see why this was my first ""favorite"" book. In third grade, a group of boys handed me The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordon and I was as skeptical as a nine-year-old girl can be--why would I want this odd fantasy book? Deciding to trust the boys, I started a whirlwind journey that would consist of seven years of being obsessed with the world of Percy Jackson. In fact, you would be hard-pressed to find a school notebook of mine that did not have some creepy fan fiction or fan art in it. What I love about it has changed with me, as I now understand the science behind writing a good book more than I did, but this truly remains a masterpiece and I am not disappointed with my elementary school taste.

Percy Jackson is a juvenile delinquent, a boy whose smallest problem is that he's going to be kicked out of boarding school again. His life is quickly turned around when the gods and monsters of his textbook start to come to life before him--especially when he's angered a few of them. Percy and his friends have only a few days to set things right on Olympus before World War III commences.

This book is incredibly important. So much went right over my head when I was younger, and I couldn't be more thankful that I reread it. Percy Jackson his mom. That seems like a strange thing to be excited about; however, parents in books--especially ones like this--are set up as either completely uninvolved in their children's lives, or evil villains trying to stop their children from reaching their true potential. Sally Jackson is a mortal woman married to a physically abusive scumbag, , got pregnant as a teen and never saw the father again, finished high school later, and now works a minimum wage job. Despite this, she's presented as a lovely woman who loves her son, selflessly sacrifices her own life for his well-being, and Poseidon himself declares her ""a queen among mortal women."" I love how Percy appreciates everything she does even if he doesn't understand it right away. Riordon presented a very fresh way on how we view women like Sally and how boys should treat their mothers.

Along with dear Sally, I Annabeth. I'm not going to pretend that she wasn't the driving force in my mind for years and years. I've always been obsessed with Annabeth. I wanted a blonde wig and gray contacts, I took an architecture class just because she loves it, I've drawn her on every worksheet and worn my orange t-shirt with pride. Now, as an older reader, I can appreciate her even more. She's not a wimp, she's mature beyond her twelve years, she fights ""with the boys"" (figuratively and literally), she's beautiful but her brains are more important (not to mention that she's respected for them!), she's witty and she has uncommon interests like architecture, she loves to read, she's so brave (in the big things like facing monsters and the seemingly smaller things like facing her stepmom), and she is such an important heroine. I can't sing her praises enough. I am nothing like Annabeth, but she is such a good role-model despite the fact that she kills monsters.

Now let's get on to the literature side of things. I am so thankful that I can now appreciate Riordon's mastery and it makes me sad that this book is dubbed for middle grade students so adults don't read it. This man's foreshadowing is flawless. His story arcs begin and are tied up neatly, he's a connoisseur of the plot diagram, and every little thing he does has intention. Writers, read these books. Riordon knows his way around a good technical story, that's for sure.

Not to mention that it's so exciting! I'm not typically a fantasy girl and I love reading the battle scenes! Can you tell that I'm practically gushing? I'm sure anyone reading this review has gathered that I'm a big nerd-subject-advocate. I didn't realize how much knowing these novels has helped me in school. An incredible amount of education is happening in a pretty little swords-and-dragons bundle. I could name all twelve major gods and goddesses by fourth grade, plenty of minor ones, all the big names in Greek mythology. Those are our roots, they're important, and it is so fun to learn about them through Percy Jackson. It was also wonderful to see iconic figures in literature like Zeus and Ares in a modern form that kids can identify more with than the stuffy men in togas.

Thank you for this book, Rick Riordon. I cannot thank you enough. If anyone somehow escaped adolescence without reading this book, please go find it. I'm sure your library has twelve copies. It truly is remarkable."

406,407,5,Hello Percy you're so sassy.
407,408,5,"You shall go west, and face the god who has turned,
You shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned,
You shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend,
And you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end.
It's fresh and action packed to the core; with characters - both main and supporting - that you'll find yourself loving, and a fresh take on Greek mythology to excite even those with no prior knowledge on the topic...all with a sprinkle of humor on top.


Percy Jackson keeps getting attacked by monsters that seem to be coming right out of his Greek mythology textbook. When his mom realizes this, she says it's time to take him to Camp Half-Blood. This, Percy discovers, is not your ordinary camp. It's a camp specifically for demigods - offsprings of humans and Greek gods.


Percy soon discovers that his supposedly absentee father is actually Poesiden, the Greek god of the sea. As if not enough, Zeus' master lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect, and it's up to Percy to find and return it, or risk starting a catastrophic war between the gods...

The characters introduced here are fantastic. Percy is a bit obtuse, but extremely loyal and brave with a sense of humor that will make you smile even in the darkest of situations. While Annabeth has a bit of a mysterious aura in this particular novel, her intelligence and expertise in battle prove invaluable to the quest, and I can't wait to watch her really mature and come into her own in the following books. Grover's a bit of a third wheel, but provides great comedic relief when needed.

The myths are included into the story wonderfully, while not being overly preachy or giving too little information. Riordan somehow manages to incorporate all these myths accurately into a plotline, while still adding his signature humor throughout.



Highly recommended for anyone looking for something quick and entertaining to read; and even those who don't. This is a must-read for everyone."

409,410,5,"(Review originally posted on Alexa Loves Books)

There's already been so much that's been said about this series, but I still feel like putting my own two cents in - especially seeing as how this is probably the fourth or fifth time I've read it.

The concept behind the series itself is brilliant. Greek mythology meets modern-day world? Hell yes! It's one of those situations where I wish I had thought of it first; but I can appreciate what Rick Riordan has done in bringing it all together for the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. As someone who's always been fascinated with the gods and goddesses of Greek myths, it's definitely fun to see them come alive in these books, and be given such specific personas.

The first book is a great introduction to a whole host of fantastic characters: Percy (our MC, who finds that he's the Son of Poseidon), Annabeth (my personal favorite character, a daughter of Athena who's smart and sassy), Grover (a satyr, who is guardian to Percy), Chiron (a centuar) and as many Greek gods and goddesses as you would want to suit your fancy - everyone from King Zeus to Hermes the messenger and Iris, goddess of the rainbow.

Apart from that, we go to a great number of interesting locations - Mt. Olympus (which is apparently located above the Empire State Building), the Underworld and Camp Half-Blood, being just a few. Even though Riordan leans towards more action-packed scenes, the descriptions are still enough to provide a beautiful visualization to the reader.

The book covers Percy's discovery of his god ancestry, his introduction to Camp Half-Blood where kids like him are sent for training, and his journey to retrieve Zeus' lightning bolt after being accused of stealing it (including uncovering a mysteriously larger conspiracy behind this theft!). Though it might seem like a lot to pack into one book, I think all these things are brought out and resolved quite well throughout the book.

Percy's an ""underdog"" hero, similar to Harry Potter in that sense at least (although I can't see how else they would be similar at all, as Harry is from the world of wizardry and Percy's world revolves more around mythology). It's easy to want to root for him, to see him succeed and to feel his losses as keenly as he does.

It's enjoyable for me to see him battling some interesting opponents early on in the series, including Medusa, Ares and the Furies. The action scenes are a lot of fun and watching Percy using both brains and brawn was a lot of fun. It also helps that he has his best friends (Annabeth and Grover) fighting alongside him - their trio definitely makes for an interesting combination throughout the book.

Overall, this is a book that I could not put down... even when I read it for the fifth time. I get instantly absorbed into the story; it's definitely a series I'd recommend for fans of Greek mythology, underdog heroes, as well as even recommending it to the younger, middle grade audience."
410,411,5,"Leído por segunda vez 11/2020 -

¡Me ha encantado! Sobre todo las referencias a mitología, la madre de Percy, Annabeth, el propio Percy...
Me gusta mucho cómo avanza todo y va cobrando sentido. Y sobre todo el tono del libro en general. Maravilloso. He hecho un hilo con citas: https://twitter.com/Stiby2/status/132...



Leído por primera vez 08/2016 - Reseña:

Hace muchos años que tenía ganas de leer algún libro de fantasía que se centrase en la mitología, y de repente encontré esta saga y supe que de alguna manera, estaba hecha para mí. He tardado en ponerme a leerlos desde que los compré, pero por fin me he puesto a ello.

El libro me ha gustado mucho. Es indudable que es bastante infantil, pero en parte se agradece en mi caso, pues soy una completa negada en cuanto a mitología se refiere. A nivel de personajes, creo que está muy bien construido. Para ser un libro para niños, no se ven claramente desde el principio las intenciones de cada uno, ni el pie del que cojean. Van conociéndolos poco a poco y descubriendo que algunos no son lo que parecían.

En cuanto a argumento, típicas aventuras de un niño que descubre que es algo más que un niño con dificultades de aprendizaje. Un niño que descubre que detrás del mundo que todos conocen, ese que se le hace tan cuesta arriba, tal vez hay algo más, algo que sí que está hecho a su medida. Me encanta esta forma en la que los libros infantiles enfocan las cosas: el problema no eres tú, tú estás bien tal y como eres, el problema tal vez sea que todavía no has encontrado el mundo al que perteneces, eso en lo que eres bueno, lo que se te da bien. Creo que esta es una enseñanza que se puede aplicar en la vida real y a todas las edades. Cuando nos desesperamos con algo, o cuando sentimos que estamos perdiendo el tiempo o que el mundo nos juega malas pasadas. La acción no decae en ningún momento y, como decía, el tema de la mitología está bastante bien llevado porque no recarga demasiado con información, va dándola poco a poco, y con saber un poquito sobre qué Dios es cada cual, o leyendo unas líneas en Wikipedia cuando hablaban de uno u otro, el argumento se sigue perfectamente aunque no tengas ni puñetera idea de quién es Afrodita, o Hades.

Ha habido un par de detalles que se me han hecho pesados, por ejemplo: los sueños. Me cuesta mucho entender esas cosas en los libros y siempre que las leo siento que me estoy perdiendo algo. Pero han sido detalles sin importancia que no han enturbiado la magia de volver a sentir ganas de sumergirme no sólo en la historia, sino en el mundo en el que se desarrolla.

Estoy deseando seguir con la segunda parte. Pero tendrá que esperar al menos hasta mañana.

Creo que es la tercera vez que leo este libro y siempre la abandono y nunca sigo con la saga. Toda la culpa la tiene las portadas nuevas. Porque tengo los dos primeros libros en físico en español de las ediciones viejas y por ende no combinan con las nuevas. Pero ahora que desde el año pasado básicamente respiro audiolibros, me di cuenta que podía retomar la saga y continuarla en audiolibros (además me di cuenta que las ediciones en inglés viejas son como las nuestras viejas y tal vez pueda completar la saga en mis estanterías en ambos idiomas🤩).
Por suerte, este mes empezó el @campamentomestizochallenge y uno de lo retos era leer el primer libro de la saga. No sé si esta iniciativa va a seguir el mes que viene -ya no me acuerdo pero sé que estaba en las reglas- pero me vendría muy bien leer un libro de Percy por mes. Veremos cómo nos va.

Bueno, ahora a lo que nos compete.
Este libro tiene todo lo que me gusta. Es middlegrade, hay una quest, es decir, hay una misión, y tiene mitología griega. Más no se le puede pedir🤩
Por otro lado, ya deben saber que yo y la fantasía urbana recién nos estamos conociendo pero no siempre congeniamos. Yo no recordaba que esto también es fantasía urbana. Pero el leerlo me re sirvió para identificar por qué me gustaba tanto este libro perteneciendo a ese subgénero. Y es que con este libro, con el mundo basado en mitología griega que Riordan se mandó, la parte ""urbana"" siento que no es lo que predomina. La mitología embellece toda la historia así que el aspecto de fantasía urbana no me molesta tanto con estos libros.

Lo que más me gusta de estos libros no es solo la mitología (aunque en gran parte sí), sino también el humor de los personajes, y sobre todo el de Percy. Siempre me hace muy bien al alma este niño.
Y la relación entre Percy y su mamá es una de las más preciosas en la literatura juvenil. No la recordaba así, tan linda, pero en esta relectura supe disfrutarla y apreciarla más.






En resumen, una relectura super entretenida y amena, justo para estos tiempos que estamos pasando. Siento que los middlegrade son excelentes para leer en estos momentos. Lleno de humor, acción, aventura y muchos monstruos. Con unos personajes queribles y entrañables. Y con un inglés super fácil para los que estén buscando un libro para empezar con el idioma.

412,413,5,"Primero que nada, que buen libro.
Nunca me aburrió, la trama me encantó y los personajes también.
Éste es un libro que quería leer desde hace tiempo y al fin lo leí, y cumplió todas mis expectativas.
El libro es corto pero tiene todo lo necesario, te da ganas de seguir y seguir leyendo.
Nunca leí un libro que hable sobre la mitología y eso me encantó, a medida que avanza el libro mencionan algunas palabras o frases en griego antiguo,y también mitos sobre monstruos y los dioses, eso me pareció super interesante.
Además tiene un plot twist al final que te deja recalculando y uniendo cabos.
Ahora hablemos de los personas, todos son únicos (incluso los que no me agradan) cada uno tiene un carácter y personalidad únicos.Pero hablemos de los protagonistas, el mejor trío de amigos; Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase y Grover Underwood. Que hermosos personajes, me encariñe muy fácil con ellos. Y también otros personajes que destacó porque me gustaron mucho son: Sally Jackson,Ares el dios de la guerra y Crusty.
Durante el libro me reí y tuve mis momentos para fangirlear, 100% recomendado.

413,414,5,"“Earthshaker, Stormbreaker, Father of Horses. Hail, Perseus Jackson, Son of the Sea God”

The Lightning Thief is the book one of Percy Jackson and the Olympians Series by Rick Riordan and it is all about the Greek Mythology.

Back when I’m a 3rd year high school student, one of our lessons in English is the Greek Mythology. I have to admit that I hate that topic, too many characters and too many events to memorize. We also watched the Iliad and the Odyssey just to understand that lesson. After the discussion, which took us 2 weeks to finish, our teacher advised that we should watch a new movie connected to our lesson and it is “The Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. I watched it, became my favorite movie and it makes me interested to Greek Mythology.

The Lightning Thief is about Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon: God of the Sea, and his journey being a Demigod: Half-human, half-God. Sound cool, right? I guess not, especially when you’re the suspect in stealing Zeus’ master bolt. He needs to find it and the real thief before a war starts. Doing that is not that easy because of the monsters distracting him. With the help of Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena: Goddess of Wisdom and Battle Strategies, and the satyr, Grover Underwood, Percy’s protector/keeper, they must bring the bolt to Zeus before it’s too late.

It is a great story about Greek Mythology, Family, and Friendship. An adventure full of Gods and Goddesses, magic, monsters and battles.


The book is way, way, way, way better than the movie. (I’m not exaggerating, it is 100000000x better) Everything in the book is changed and it is obviously rushed, the movie ruined the book. More demigods, more characters, more enemies, more events, more creatures and longer quest. It was my favorite movie. Too bad. :(

I also liked Annabeth because she wants to be an architect. YES! I’m biased. Haha. :P

It is a funny, heart stopping, thrilling, exciting and full of adventure. A very good book. Two thumbs up.

I won't make this review long. My heart is just too full with this third read I can't think properly. This series is one of the reasons why I became a bookdragon and I will forever thank Uncle Rick for this. Percy will always be a part of my life. The Lightning Thief is a cleverly-written book which incorporates Greek Mythology and the modern world seamlessly. Riordan is a master at creating lovable characters and witty dialogues. This book is so fun to read that's why I'll read it over and over again until I keel over.

•••

FOURTH READ (06/18/19)

I LOVE THIS SERIES WITH MY WHOLE HEART. Everytime I reread Percy Jackson, my admiration for Uncle Rick deepens. Also, major screamfest because UNCLE RICK NOTICED MY TWEET LAST JUNE 5 AND SAID THAT PROMOTING RRP IS THE ""BEST SENTIMENT EVER"". Of course, I flat-out cried (I'm not exaggerating) when he quoted my tweet because my greatest hero noticed me after two long years of hoping to catch his attention on the ever famous bird app. I still think I'm dreaming whenever I think of this.

Anyway, back to the review. I really love how Uncle Rick packed a lot of small adventures (Aunty Em's statues, Crusty, Lotus Hotel, Cerberus) to cement Percy, Grover, and Annabeth's relationship. I admire how he paid attention to their character arcs even if this is just the first book in a series. I also can't help but notice some details about my favorite characters. Say, Percy for example. We always credit Annabeth for being smart (which she hella is) but we hardly talk about Percy's cleverness. He figured out lots of mysteries on the course of his adventure and even knew who the guy on the pit was without Annabeth's help. We have to give Percy a lot more credit for being sassy AND smart.

Simply put, I love this series and will reread it again next year. The sea cannot be restrained."
415,416,5,"How to begin describing my love for this book... I'm not sure where to start. It's been several years since the first time I heard the story, read aloud by my father, and it's rested near my heart ever since. With every new book Rick puts out, I still think, ""Man, I can't believe all of this stemmed from The Lightning Thief"". But man, it can.
This book was so wonderfully different. When it hit the market (12 years ago, what???), the closest thing to it was Harry Potter, and even that didn't have this level of humor and self-awareness. I was laughing out loud every other line.
I love seeing the beginnings of Percy and Annabeth's relationship, I love Grover with all of my heart, I forgot how awesome Sally is right off the bat, and it's so interesting to me, knowing where the characters end up, to see where they started. I forgot just how bitter Percy is at life before he has friends and a place to belong. I forgot about Medusa's head and the flying shoes being worn by Grover and how the Lotus hotel really served no purpose but to kill five days and set up a backstory for Nico and Bianca. I forgot about Waterland and that Annabeth goes home for the year and that Percy gets cleared as a national fugitive and painted as a national story of sympathy.
I can't wait to re-read the rest of the series and see what else I've forgotten.
5 stars, obviously.


re-read 2023:
truly iconic how all these grown, thousand-year-old adults/monsters look at this 12-year-old kid and are like ""yeah... you need to die now"""
416,417,5,"First of I should say that I have watched the movie that came out few years ago. While the movie was not the best I still enjoyed the story. But that being said I knew a lot of the things happening in book one and not much surprised me but solely because I watched the movie and not because it was super easy to predict. Also I’m much older than the target audience but that did not stop me from loving this book just as much.
I’m not sure what else is there to say that has not been said about this book so I will make it short and sweet.
If you like and are a fan of Greek Mythology than this book is a must read for you. But really anyone who likes fantasy will enjoy this book.
It is packed full, action, plot twist and is hard to put down, It is super easy to get lost in the world with Percy and his friends. All of them are very likable and enjoyable.
Not to mention this book is super funny and had me laughing out loud on many occasions.
All I can say is that I highly recommend this book to anyone, no matter age.
I rate it 5 ★"
417,418,5,"5 stars!!!

Wow! I read this when I was younger but I didn’t realise it was this good! Absolutely amazing book!
Yes this is a book aimed at young people but it honestly it’s a great book no matter how old you are – fast paced and exciting.

I mean what’s not to love about this book it gives a modern simplified take on Greek mythology with Percy Jackson the most lovable and relatable character EVER!

Percy is thrown into the world of the god’s and faces monsters and emotional trauma like no other 12yr old, yet he stays brave and strong throughout. I found myself constantly rooting for Percy and he’s friends!

“It's funny how humans can wrap their mind around things and fit them into their version of reality.”

“Go on with what your heart tells you, or you will lose all.”

“Even strength must bow to wisdom sometimes.”

This book also delivers some killer quotes!.

This is quite a detailed book for a middle-grade read which makes it ideal for any age! I read this book so quickly and not just because it was a book aimed at young people but just because it was just so much FUN!

If you are bored of a book your reading or are struggling to finish one – take a break and read this you won’t regret it and I guarantee you will want to be moving on to the next like me!

AMAZING!

On to the next!"
418,419,5,"After a very long time I got a wonderful taste of reading such an awesome fantasy like Harry Potter.Rick Riordan has justified the twists and flows of facts a fantasy should have. I don't know why I didn't read it before and watched the movie earlier. While reading the 10th or 11th chapter I watch the movie as I can't resist myself from knowing the ultimate thievery of the lightening bolt which slows my reading a little bit afterwards. But the more I read , the more I discovered the differences between the movie and the book and undoubtedly the book is much more interesting than the movie. I don't know why the movie people keep silent about the conspiracy of Kronas. I mean come on! He is the main culprit.At the very beginning when Percy was found to be an undetermined demigod, I thought he must be the son of Zeus as the hero of a book must get the priority and I was kinda low to find him out as a son of the sea god but this fact goes cool with me by and by .Well, now I am looking forward to read the sequels as soon as possible and people who are interested in the Greek mythologies should read it. I am getting my old feeling to watch Disneip's Hercules again by reading the book and my favorite gods and goddesses."

Non sono solita leggere fantasy, ma questo è perfettamente adatto a me, ha tutti gli elementi che mi piacciono: scorrevolezza, leggerezza, umorismo, avventura e mitologia.
Percy Jackson è un adolescente che scopre di essere un mezzosangue, figlio di un dio e di una mortale e si ritroverà alle prese con gli Dei dell’Olimpo che si sono trasferiti a New York.
Una cosa che ho apprezza tantissimo all’interno del romanzo, sono stati i titoli dei capitoli, mi hanno fatto un sacco ridere e man mano andando avanti ero sempre più curiosa di scoprire che genere di avventure avrebbero affrontato. Mi sono affezionata a tutti i personaggi, ma in modo particolare a Percy che ha narrato tutta la vicenda, Annabeth e Grover.

424,425,5,"I read this book a long time ago and never continued the series so I figured now is as good a time as any!

The main thing I love about this book is the attention to family and friendship. Percy loves his mother and being with her makes him feel at home. He at first doesn't know what to think about Poseidon as his father, but like so many of us, he feels the need to make him proud even if he doesn't exactly like him. This is just so relatable and I loved these meaningful moments in this story.

And, of course, there is Half Blood Camp, a quest, monsters to fight and lots of twists and turns !

Definitely recommend if you haven't read these yet. I am definitely going to continue this series ❤"

429,430,5,"Dou as 5 estrelas a medo que o próximo ainda seja melhor eheh , mas okay... se for melhor volto atrás e mudo a pontuação deste.
Posso dizer-vos que amei bastante e que vou fazer uma opinião especial em principio, senão volto cá e coloco aqui o que irei dizer no vídeo.
Este livro é muito bom para quem ama mitologia, ou senão ama e quer apenas conhecer ótimo vá em frente.
Super engraçado, leve e rápido, com muitas novidades em cada capítulo! :D"
430,431,5,"First time reader of Rick Riorden, and I am impressed. My son was caught on this story like a fish on a hook and reeled in so quick I had to restart to the places he left off before falling asleep he enjoyed it so much.
It was nothing like the movie (guilty) and I liked it even better for that in all honesty. My son gives a rating of 5. So a 5 it is. I hope he'll reread this story when he can read fully on his own."
431,432,5,"I can't believe I waited this long to read it but my god was it amazing!! I finally get what all the hype is about! All I want is to be able to stay at Camp Half-Blood, I don't think that's to much to ask? I loved Percy and Annabeth and I can't wait to read the rest of the series and see what happens!"
432,433,5,"This was such a fun read. After finishing the Heroes of Olympus series, I saw so many connections. Also, I found myself more interested in Luke’s character. I remember hating this character was I younger, but now I see his character in a different light. Even though this my third time re-reading this series, I still feel like I am reading this for the first time.

Now onto Sea of Monsters!"
433,434,5,"This series was my childhood, and to be fair, it is in fact this series that actually got me into reading books, so I wouldn’t be reading as much I am now without Riordan’s books. Thanks.

I highly recommend it and it’s full of monsters, mythology magic and teenage love later on. Also, try not to watch the films."
434,435,5,"I read this book when I was in 6th grade, and we read it together as a language arts class.

I loved this book. I have never read one about greek mythology like this before. The author really got the characters and the gods and goddesses were given great personalities.

I would honestly recommend this book to people who like greek mythology or just want to try something new.

Enjoy! ;)"
435,436,5,"оно само как-то получилось, аудиокнига очень легко и быстро слушается...у меня уже в голове строятся диалоги и сцены сериала

Първа среща с поредицата Пърси Джаксън
КНИЖНИ РЕВЮТАTEMIPANAYOTOVAМАЙ 15, 20170

Както може би сте видяли от снимките, които публикувах в последния месец – здраво се трудех върху четенето на поредицата за Пърси Джаксън и боговете на Олимп. Ако искайте вярвайте, но това ми беше първият прочит, явно моето по-младо аз е решило да предпочете Хари. След едно 25г. му дойде време и на Пърси. Искам от сърце да благодаря на Рали от RoseRed’s world Blog, задето ме тикаше ли тикаше да опитам поредицата и сега имам възможност да разкажа колко ми хареса и че правилно ме е бутала към нея.

Та – в този пост ще кажа какво от сърце мисля за всяка една част от книгите. Надолу може да има спойлери и много снимки – който не я е чел – бегом марш от тука и да я забира от близката книжарница – че и с нови мега яки корици. *Спойлер: ако съберете всички 5, отстрани се вижда Ню Йорк!


Книга 1 : Похитителят на мълнии


Книгата е по-хубава от филмът – би казал всеки гледал филмовата адаптация на тази част. Да, признавам, гледала съм го преди да прочета книгата – и ей на – сега вече мога да вникна в историята и след като недостигналите до екран моменти от книгата попълниха пропуските, започнах да разбирам идеята на Риърдън.

„Ако си взел тази книга, защото подозираш, че и ти си като мен, по-добре я захвърли веднага. Повярвай в лъжите, които мама и татко са ти наговорили за раждането ти, и се опитай да живееш нормално. Да си син на божество е опасно. И страшно. Най-често води до смърт по особено жесток начин. Да не кажеш после, че не съм те предупредил…“

Прочела съм Магнус Чейс и Изпитанията на Аполон, ��о след прочита на поредицата за Пърси Джаксън, всичко започна бавно да си идва по местата. За разлика от другите книги на чичо ви Рик, които съм чела, почувствах Пърси коренно разл��чен. В Пърси го няма онзи типичен хумор на Риърдън, който може да се срещне в другите книги, пак го има но доста по-малко. И точно с това ме грабна Пърси! Може би, писателят още е опипвал почвата и за мен изказа беше доста сдържан от познатия му хумор. Пак ми беше забавно, но повече интересно – а в някой други негови книги, като че ли е обратното – залага на хумора си, а не на историята.

Кратка история на книга 1: Чудовищата надушват Пърси, Гроувър го завежда в лагера на полубоговете. Тръгва на мисия да намери изгубената светкавица на Зевс и да спаси майка си от подземния свят. За първи път среща Анабет и започва началото на дълго планираният план на Люк, под влиянието на Кронос, да срине Олимп.

Книга 2 : Морето на чудовищата


След като сме се запонали с част от главните действащи лица в книга едно, отново сина на Посейдон ще се изправи пред поредното предизвикателство – да влезне в Морето на чудовищата или така познат за нас като Бермудския триъгълник, където се крие Златното руно. *Неочакван малък шок – разбира че има брат и то циклоп.

“Families are messy. Immortal families are eternally messy. Sometimes the best we can do is to remind each other that we’re related for better or for worse…and try to keep the maiming and killing to a minimum.”

Лично за мен, филмът беше доста забавен, като най-любимият ми момент е като влизат в пещерата на циклопа и намират Гроувър да се прави на жена, за да не го изядат:



Не помня дали в първата част бече включена, но ако не бъркам, това е частта, в която се запознаваме с Кларис, дъщерята на Арес бога на войната. На Кронос му се размина този път, но все пак по всичко личи, че набира сили да се върне.

*Вторни шок: спасяват дървото, което пази лагера – но руното прави още повече – освобождава дъщерята на Зевс, Талия. Разбира се, за да е по-логично, тя вече е на възрастта на тинейджър. И всички започват да си блъскат главите – ами сега за кой иде реч в това велико предсказание от Делфийския оракул.



Книга 3 : Проклятието на титана


…Стоварих се на земята. Виеше ми се свят. Отворих очи, бях в краката на Артемида, която с последни сили едва крепеше небосвода на раменете си.
– Бягай, момче! – изсъска тя. – Бягай!
Атлас самодоволно пое към мен. Мечът ми го нямаше. Беше отхвръкнал настрани. След няколко секунди отново щеше да се появи в джоба ми, но тогава вече нямаше да има никакво значение. Щях да съм мъртъв. Люк и Талия се сражаваха с настървението на диви зверове, край тях трещяха мълнии и светкавици. Анабет лежеше на земята и се мъчеше да се освободи от белезниците на китките си.
– Умри, геройче! – Атлас вдигна копието си, за да ме прониже.

Мисля, че от всички книги в поредицата, тази определено ми беше най-любимата от всичките.

Кратка история на книга 3: Пърси получава странна молба за помощ от приятеля си Гроувър. Всичко, което ще му трябва, са Анабет и Талия, верният му меч Въртоп и… мама да го хвърли донякъде с колата. Тримата приятели се впускат в спасителна мисия само за да открият, че Гроувър е намерил нещо много важно – две изключително мощни деца-герои, чиито родители са неизвестни.



Та, тъй като вече доста хора сигурно са чели книгите – ще разкривам тайните направо. Двете деца, които Гроувър намира са деца Хадес, третият от големите – Бианка и Нико – както се казва само това ни липсваше в картинката. Но миг преди да се измъкнат невредими, един от геройте загива – Бианка – и за кратко време Нико започва да обвинява Пърси за смъртта й. Анабет бива отвлечена от Люк, по-скоро с идея за примамка на другите герой, за да дойдат да я спасят. Съвсем неочаквано в историята се появява и Атлас (един от титаните, наказан от Зевс да крепи на раменете си небето, защото участвал в бунта на титаните срещу боговете), който с цел да се спаси от наказанието си е минал на страната на Кронос.

И тъй, Кронос продължава да събира сили, докато нашите герой търсят начин да го спрат.

Книга 4 : Проклятието на титана


След това забелязах чудовището. То стоеше на осветен подиум в другия край на залата. Тялото беше на едър лъв, а главата – на жена, която можеше и да изглежда красива, ако не си беше сложила толкова много грим и косата ѝ не беше вдигната на кок – напомни ми на учителката ми по пеене в трети клас. На гърдите ѝ имаше картонче, прикрепено със синя панделка, на което пишеше: „Образцово чудовище“.
– Сфинкс! – изскимтя Тайсън.
Знаех на какво се дължеше страхът му. Когато е бил малък, един сфинкс го беше нападнал в Ню Йорк. Все още си личаха белезите по гърба му. От двете страни на чудовището блестяха прожектори. Единственият изход от залата беше точно зад подиума. Механичният паяк се промуши между лапите на сфинкса и изчезна в тъмнеещия проход.

И ето пак се впускаме в поредната година, в която Пърси ще го намерят чудовища и внезапно ще напусне училище. Войната е близко, а лагерът вече не е най-безопасното място. Нашите герой разкриват плана на Люк на намери нишката на Ариадна, за да може да минава незабелязано из митичния лабиринт на Дедал и така да нападне лагера. Следователно, Пърси и приятелите му тръгват в търсене на Дедал и докато се лутат из лабиринта намират от странни – по-странни чудовища. *Отново шок: Най-сетне намират Пан!!

Книга 5 : Последният олимпиец


Последна книга – време за битката на века. Докато боговете се опитват да спрат Тифон (стоглав дракон, дете на Гея и Тартар) от това да унищожи Олимп, те го оставят празен и на нашите герой се пада задачата да го опазят. Кронос вече е взел почти пълно надмощие над тялото на Люк и на Пърси ще му трябва да имна по неговите стъпки, за да има сила да победи Кронос.

Още малко разбулване на тайни –

последния олимпиец е Хестия богинята на домашното огнище, която единствена остава на Олимп, докато другите се бият срещу Тифон;
реално Пърси Джаксън все пак е този, за който се разказва във великото пророчество, но не той ще реши съдбата на Олимп;
и най-важното – в пророчеството се разказва всъщност за Люк, чието тяло Кронос използва, за да се върне – решава да сложи край на живота си и на плана на Кронос. Но както се казва в книгата, той е толкова силен, че вероятността да не е унищожен е доста голяма;
Зевс предлага на Пърси да стане бог – добре че отказва – макарче щеше да стане невероятен бог на шеметите;
И най-най-сетне Анабет и Пърси се събират, което беше адски сладко и съвсем очаквано още от книга първа.

Толкова много прекрасни и топли чувства имам към тази поредица и даже само като си спомням и пиша за нея ми става и още по-хубаво. Поредицата е едно непрестанно приключение и ми се щеше да я бях захванала отдавна. Но тъй като има и други поредици в същата вселена, чичо Рик се е постарал да не скучая и да имам още доста за четене.



Ако можеш да дам повече от максималките 5 звезди на Пърси Джаксън, бих ги дала на драго сърце. Искрено се забавлявах с героите от книгата и ми хареса да стана част от тяхното приключение.



Искрени благодарности на Издателство Егмонт за изпратената поредица!"

I don't think their is a percy jackson book I could possibly rate lower than this.
This series is and always will be a masterpiece.

I read this just like the Harry Potter series for the first time in my mother language, but rereading this in English after so many years is like a whole new experience.
I 100% recommend.

When I reread books, I always find it hard to make a review about it, so imma keep it short.

The fact that i still love Percy, Annabeth, and Grover this much after so many years is the best feeling ever.

I'm looking forward to rereading the rest 🫶





My Percabeth heart can not take this🥺"
457,458,5,"Awesome.
I haven't heard of this book 'cause my country doesn't sell it, until the day I watched a movie call ""The Lightning Thief"". Honestly, I don't really like the movie( except Logan). I find out that this movie was made from a book. I don't know why I search for the ebook of the Lightning Thief. Then I know the truth that all the characters in the series are begun at the age of 12 . The book is totally different from the movie and I'm really enjoy it... I mean, really love it. You can find anything from this book. From action, to humor, fantasy, mythical creatures, fighting, friendship, and cliff hanger...!















The story started with Percy Jackson - a boy who had ADHD and dyslexia. He always get kick from school each year 'cause he always made trouble, and studied bad. He lived with his mom - Sally Jackson , and his stepfather - Smelly Gabe ( oh, I love that name). He was really hated his stepfather 'cause he always drunk and poker... He also hated his father 'cause his father had left him and his mother since he was born. But things really started weird when . Mrs. Dodds - his teacher suddenly turned into a monster and requested him for something, and suddenly, Mr.Brunner - his history teacher threw him a pen - which turned to a sword, and he slighted Mrs. Dodds. Percy thought that it was just a dream, or it was a hallucination, 'cause when he asked the other students, they told him there was no one named Mrs.Dodds even Mr.Brunner told that his school never have anyone call Mrs. Dodds, although Percy suspected Grover - his best friend was lied to him.

He saw Mrs.Dodds once again. But the worst thing is, he discovered that his friend - Grover was actually . His mother drove crazily in the car to a place call Camp Half Blood while there was a monster chased after them and it is a . The minotaur killed his mom in front of him, and Percy was really furious that he kill the minotaur for revenge. He cried a lot and carry Grover to Camp Half Blood.
He learned the truth about himself.
. He refused to believe that the Gods of Greece are still living in the modern world to day. But he soon get used to it.
His ADHD causes him to have extra good battle reflexes, his dyslexia makes him read ancient Greek better.
He made friends with Luke - the head counselor of Hermes cabin, and Annabeth - another 12- year-old smart and beautiful girl with grey eyes and blonde hair from the Athena cabin. He tried not to painful and guilty about his mom's death, and started to learn sword-fighting, arrow, javelins, canoes,... He also knew that Mr.Brunner was actually Chiron - a centaur who taught heroes. He also had his first enemy - Clarisse - a stubborn, awful, quite ferocious, daughter of Ares who loved to bully new kids.
He started to enjoy his new home - Camp Half Blood.
He loved to eat dinner with his friends, and fighting, and hearing the sounds of monster in the night.
But things changed. He had nightmare most of nights.
After the Friday night, he knew who was his father. Everybody knew. He was the son of P.... ( Spoiler). Poseidon. The son of the Big Three.
Annabeth turned out to hate him, 'cause Athena and Poseidon used to against each other.
In the Olympians, Zeus had lost his lightning thief.
Someone stole it, it is definitely a human, or a demigod. Zeus thought it was Percy.
But Percy sured he was innocent.
How could he proved that?
He was just a 12-year-old child.







He had a quest. Annabeth and Grover agreed to accompanied. But could Percy complete his mission?
Who is the god he had to face? Who betrayed him?
Percy began his adventure and fighting with monsters, traveled around America to find the thief and the lightning...
But one things for sure:"
458,459,5,"bueno que decir... amé esta historia, si bien es un libro bastante introductorio me re enganchó. me encariñé con todos los personajes (percy bebé te amo 🥺), la trama es re entretenida y siempre está pasando algo importante, además aguante la mitología griega por dios. el plot twist del final me dejó en shock NO LO VI VENIR
en fin, sin dudas voy a seguir la saga rick riordan ya me enamoraste"

Rick, ¡gracias por leerle esas historias a tus hijos antes de dormir! Acabas de crear una multitud de padres que le leen a sus hijos, también."
460,461,5,"I- wow. I absolutely loved this book. The characters are amazing, the plot is awesome, it's just perfect. Tiktok kinda spoiled me the end but I still enjoyed it a lot. I need to read the next book right now. 5⭐"

464,465,5,"Love!
Seriously though, I’m a 26 year old woman with ADHD and Percy is a 12 year old middle schooler and I’ve never related to a character more!❤️❤️❤️"
465,466,5,"Esto... No hay palabras para describir este libro, me encanta, todo me encanta.
La forma de escribir de Rick Riordan es asombrosa.
Me encanta como va creciendo la amistad de Percy, Grover y Annabeth, las batallas son espectaculares, en fin, amo el libro.
Lo recomiendo?
Absolutamente."
466,467,5,"Por fin me decidí a darle oportunidad a esta saga de la que todo el mundo estaba hablando y yo no entendía por qué. Sí, sé que hay película pero no la vi. Sí, ya sé que no hay que dejarse llevar por el hype, pero quise echar un vistazo para ver de qué diablos iba la cosa y gracias a Dios que dejé mis prejuicios de lado porque me encontré con un libro genial.

Después de leer tanta bullshit juvenil empecé a mirar con miedo todas estas sagas populares, así que agarré este libro con cero expectativas, porque creo que más allá de las malas experiencias no hay que cortar vínculos con los géneros y darles oportunidades... ¡y qué bien que hice esta vez!

Si hubiera elegido esta saga a los 15 años quizás la hubiera disfrutado más porque se nota a lo lejos que está escrita para determinado público. Pero la disfruté mucho teniendo 23 años, así que eso puede que hable bien del autor o hable mal de mi... pero ese no es el punto. Creo.

Percy, nuestro protagonista, es un personaje muy querible por su humor ácido y comentarios irónicos. Los personajes secundarios también tienen lo suyo. Grover me parece el personaje más tierno y chistoso, y admiro mucho la valentía y audacia de Annabeth.

Y la historia está muy bien contada, tiene momentos de acción y misterio que te tienen atrapado al libro desde la página uno. Tiene mucha información interesante para gente como yo que no leyó jamás un ápice de mitología, aprendés mucho y es genial la manera en que Riordan hizo coincidir las características de esos seres mitológicos y sus mitos, valga la redundancia, para que encajen en la trama.

Disfruté mucho de este libro, es uno de esos descubrimientos que te dejan feliz y querés seguir leyendo más, pero decidí hacerlo lento, porque este tomo me lo leí en día y medio, y la saga solo tiene cinco, no quiero que se me termine rápido.

Recomiendo esta saga a toda persona que quiera meterse en el mundo de la lectura desde temprana edad, tanto si tenés quince años, o si tenés algún hermanx, sobrinx, amiguitx o lo que sea, o si tenés más de 20 años como yo y no podés soltar el género.

Ah, y no, no vi la película y no pienso hacerlo. La historia muy linda en mi cabeza, y quiero que permanezca así.

Seguime en:"
467,468,5,"""...""(I)f you recognize yourself in these pages-if you feel something stirring inside- stop reading immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before THEY sense it too, and they'll come for you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.""

I'm twelve years old again. I'm screaming ""Percy Jackon, marry me!"" I truly believe adulthood is just a myth... Happy times❤"
468,469,5,"Bueno... ¿He sido imparcial con la puntuación de este libro? La verdad es que no, lo he puntuado según mi disfrute a lo largo de la lectura (como hago siempre) y es que de verdad, me divertí un montón mientras leía el libro.

Maneja un universo interesante y combina bastante bien la mitología griega con el mundo moderno sin que se sienta forzado, la trama del libro te mantiene enganchada la mayor parte del tiempo (por lo menos conmigo fue así) y pues es un libro bastante fácil de leer, es algo que yo me leería para salir de bloqueo ¿me doy a entender?

En lo personal se me hizo muy divertido leer este libro y me entretuvo bastante dejándome de paso moralejas positivas (porque sí, todo escrito debe tener una moraleja o carece de finalidad alguna) y pues sentí que la escritura del autor (o sea, su forma de expresarse) es muy afín a mis gustos so... Amando todo.

Algo que tengo que resaltar es lo enganchada que quedé con la historia (y con la mamá de Percy, alta queena es) y el buen desarrollo que tienen los personajes principales a lo largo del libro, sentí empatía por ellos porque al fin y al cabo son niños obligados a actuar como personas adultas.

Pero, porque sí, siempre hay peros, a pesar de que para mí este libro fue un 5/5 ⭐ pude notar que tiene algunas cosas que para mí no son totalmente satisfactorias:

- Lo predecible que puede llegar a ser (tipo: predije todo lo que iba a pasar dentro de la historia correctamente sin haberme leído más del 50% de la historia y mis amigas están de testigos).

- La manera tan lineal en la que corre la historia (y ojo: no me refiero a que no haya retrospección porque en ciertos momentos sí la hay, me refiero a la manera tan simple en la que ocurren los hechos).

- Por partes (no siempre), sentía que Percy (y otros persomajes dentro de su rango de edad) era un adulto tratando muy forzosamente de sonar como un niño.

-Debido a lo predecible que es, el plot twist final (si lo podemos llamar así) no deja ningún impacto en el lector (o eso fue algo que simplemente yo experimenté, no lo sé, pero igual sigue siendo un punto válido para mí)."
469,470,5,"5/5, to no one's surprise.

What kind of fake Greek only reads Percy Jackson at 17 years of age? Me. Tragic. But I finally got around to it.

I don't think there's much to say that you haven't already heard, because this is kinda like reviewing Harry Potter. I'm gonna do it anyway. I bought the PJO box set after constantly having the series recommended to me, so my expectations were high, and I wasn't disappointed. I greek mythology and everything related to it, so I practically flew through this first book. I loved it from the start; the story is told in Percy's voice, which makes the book so easy and fun to read. I guess that after reading so many new YA, fantasy and dystopian stories that are all told in the voice, it was refreshing to read something so light-hearted and enjoyable. Rick Riordan doesn't waste any time describing unnecessary things, which I liked; by page 100, Percy is already at Camp Halfblood and the story's Main Theme is already introduced (unlike other books where the introduction drags forever, and you're on page 150 and still wondering what the problem is).

As for the story, I loved it. It had me guessing and wanting to know what happens next almost at every chapter. I mean, these Chapter Titles already pretty much summarized everything, but they were great. Some personal favorites were probably and Beautiful. I also really liked Annabeth, since she's kind of like a mix of Hermione Granger & Sydney Sage. Plus, she's Athena's daughter, and you can't get much cooler than that.

I'm glad I bought the entire series, because now I can continue and start today, probably. I'm sad it took me so many years to read this, because it feels like an essential if you like greek mythology, but at least I Am Finally Here !"
470,471,5,4.5 stars rounded up to 5 stars!!
471,472,5,"To be honest, I was terrified to read this book and it wasn't because it was scary or anything but because of the high expectations I had for it. A really good friend of mine was such a big fan of the Percy Jackson series and had raved about how amazing it was all the time. So naturally, my expectations were higher than Mt. Olympus.

I would always tell that I would read the series one day and that I was just intimidated because it was based of Greek Mythology. Now if you know me, you would know that I don't know jackshit about Greek Mythology. I was utterly clueless in that department of literature. And since I lacked knowledge, I was scared that I wouldn't understand all the references in this book and I would end up DNF-ing this hating this series. But alas, after a lot of questions and persuading from my friends, I finally picked this book up, and I ended up loving it.



I would assume that all great adventure novels start out like this. The Lightning Thief was such a joy to read. I felt myself smiling and cracking up a lot while reading this book. (Especially during the trip to Hades). I loved Percy's way of narrating the events happening in the story. It add so much more character to the book. And the action scenes kept me at the edge of my seat errrr... bed.

Percy was such a fun character to read. He was sassy, strong and brave but most of all he felt real. He wasn't just a fictional character but a real 12 year old kid in an adventure which I think is the best part about reading this book.

I cannot wait for Percy's next adventure!"
472,473,5,"at first
""If you're a normal kid, reading this because you think it's fiction, great. Read on. I envy you for being
able to believe that none of this ever happened.
But if you recognize yourself in these pages-if you feel something stirring inside-stop reading
immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it's only a mat-ter of time before they
sense it too, and they'll come for you.
Don't say I didn't warn you"".

If you've been asking yourself what would be the child of mortal and immortal? , it's a demigod and in this story Percy is demigod (half blood), ""Being a half-blood is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed in painful, nasty ways"", so there most be a place that protect those people, here is one

Zeus's lightning is stolen and he think that Percy has stole it , there will be a war between gods if the lightning didn't return before the summer solstice, Percy feels a little bit confused , he want to save the world but he might get killed ,so what will happen? and who is the real thief??



i watched the movie before reading the book , i liked the movie but it was nothing compared to the book,in the movie they just used the title and invent things between, don't watch the movie believe me it is horrible.

and for the rating:
the book deserve 5 stars and if we can rate the author i think he deserve 1000000 stars."
473,474,5,"Oh, Percy. Why didn't I read this book earlier?


Percy says hi. (Oh gods! I have this huge schoolgirl crush on Logan Lerman. He is just adorable!)

I really don't have to review this, because it seems that everyone has read it already. I just want to say that I absolutely loved this book. Percy was a great hero, and Annabeth was a great heroine.

P.S. Alexandra Daddario is gorgeous. And yes, she'll be blond in the next movie!"
474,475,5,"“My name is Percy Jackson. I'm twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy, a private school for troubled kids in upstate New York. Am I a troubled kid?
Yeah. You could say that.”

This book truly means the world to me. It's like the novel equivalent of Kraft Mac & Cheese and Kool-Aid; no matter how awful I feel, it'll always make things look better. The writing, the characters, the humor, everything is just incredible. And who can dislike a book with a chapter titled, “I Become Supreme Lord of The Bathroom”?
On a more serious note, if you’ve ever felt like you don’t belong or like you’re not good enough, particularly as a kid, this one’s for you.
I can't thank Uncle Rick enough for creating this series and giving the world Percy, Annabeth, and Grover."

I really enjoyed this. Riordan was clever in the way he included mythology in the mortal world. Full of action, the plotline steamed ahead and encourages you to keep reading.

Some of the plot could be described as predictable if you already know about Greek mythology and I realised what the friend line in the prophesy meant pretty quickly but that didn't detract from the enjoyablity of the novel and I am looking forward to ."

Just as I was reading the very first paragraph of this wonderful book, nostalgia came rushing through. It was like reading this for the first time, like all of the events suprised me still, yet I felt the wonderful familiarty of it all. I just missed being in this world so much. The cleverness, the humor, the thrill with all of their journeys. Everything. And most especially, I missed Persassy so much, my all time favorite fictional character of all. So excited to re-read the whole series, and even the Heroes of Olympus, this year."
477,478,5,"OH MY GOD!!! WHAT an awesome way to open a series.
I LOVED it!I honestly feel bad that I haven't started the Perxy Jackson series earlier, but I was always afraid I wouldn't be able to follow because I literally don't know anything about Greek Gods, etc. Boy was I wrong, the author described them enough to understand everything.
I liked the action in it, the characters and the twists. I cannot wait to read book #2!"
478,479,5,"I am not going to count it as part of the challenge because I skimmed through the end. I already read it when I was 16 and even though I absolutely loved it, it is time to move towards the next books in this same series.
Opinion: it is definitely a must-read for teens and young adults, as well as children and really, anyone. The humor is fresh and the way Riordan incorporates Greek Mythology into 21th century is brilliant."
479,480,5,"This book is amazing!❤️ It was giving me Harry Potter vibes😁 I loved this book. And there is some bit of mystery too!!!!!
It was a bit boring in the first few chapters but when Percy and his friends leaves for the underworld mission the story gets gripping. I was really eager to know that who stole the lightning bolt. There are many twists and turns in the book but there is a very big twist in the end!!!!😊
Loved it❤️
Go for it....."
480,481,5,"Qué puedo decir que no se haya dicho ya de este libro, definitivamente se corona como mi mejor lectura en lo que llevo del año.

La narración es atrapante, entretenida y graciosa, sin quitar el drama claro. Además, los personajes están estructurados de una manera maravillosa que me fue imposible no simpatizar con ellos; les tomé mucho cariño a todos.

Por supuesto que me quiero comer los libros siguientes ya!!"
481,482,5,I am absolutely devastated that my parents never bought me these books as a kid! Even as an adult that book is so beautifully written and I was hooked from start to finish. Percy Jackson is such a well written character and I think any kid who reads this can find a way to relate to him or even Annabeth. I’m so excited to read the next books in the series. Catch me turning into a Percy simp over this next month…

486,487,5,finished my reread through as an adult. percy jackson is still the cutest thing ever. such a good boy. grover still an amazing friend and super funny. annabeth while not my fave (no shade) still a baddy and i can respect that. call it nostalgia but this book is still a solid four.

507,508,5,"Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thie’ is a book that absolutely nobody is allowed to dislike. I bet that even if someone was desperate to find only one weak point of this novel they wouldn’t be able to do this. Guess why? Because ‘Percy Jackson and Lightning Thief’ has no weak points and you can’t convince me any other way. I must point out that it is not only my opinion but also a universally acknowledged truth. Water is wet, the sky is blue, the grass is green and Percy Jackson has no weak points. You are probably wondering why. I’d be very glad to explain this to you.

Firstly, the characters. Nobody in writing history has ever created such characters as Rick Riodan in Percy Jackson Books. Everybody there is unique and I think it is a very beautiful thing because there are not a lot of books where the author promotes tolerance by creating the varied characters and showing that no matter who you are, who do you think you are, who your parents are, where you were born, what is your financial situation or who the world told you to be, you can still find home and place to belong somewhere just like Percy Jackson’s characters found their comfort place in Half-Blood Camp. There is a place in the world where you’ll never feel alone and it is very comforting to have this thought back in your mind.

The whole Percy Jackson’s universe fastly becomes also a comfort place for a reader, because it is not hard to fall in love with the whole idea of greek gods living in America and procreating. Ignoring the Percy’s warning that he gives us at the very beginning of the book you thirst for being a kid of some god and feel deep grief about the fact that you are just a human. As soon as you start reading your deepest desire is to have an opportunity to go on the quest with Percy, joke around with Grover or have a deep talk with Annabeth. I conclude that you feel that strong bond between yourself and this book because basically, you observe a very clear process of growing up and the development of the characters. We meet Percy when he is twelve and at this age, things change very fast. I suppose that the relationship between you and this novel is, even more, deeper if you read Percy Jackson at the age of 10-13 because then you not only feel as if you are the observer but also like you are growing up with them.

The second thing that is just as remarkable as the characters ( it is just impossible to put everything in the first paragraph) is the plot and its development. The plot was led in a smart way that makes the readers impatient but also able to enjoy what they are reading right now. Sometimes while reading books I’m only willing to find out about the ending and the whole plot is the only thing that leads me to do the the final act. But while reading Percy Jackson you are willing to know the ending as much as you are willing to read the things that lead you to the it. It is some kind of value crisis because you want to keep reading and finish the book at the same time.

So as you see my review is more like the love letter to ‘Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief than a review, but you really can’t blame me. I would say that my WHOLE LIFE is a love letter to Percy Jackson and I love this book more than I love myself, so you can easily conclude that I didn’t do the best of my ability here. I rate this book 5/5 because it is illegal to give it something else."
508,509,5,"5 stars!
let me start this by saying i totally get the hype now, only i wished i'd read it when i was younger– i bet it would've been so fun growing up reading this series.
it had me hooked from the start, a fast-paced fun read that may or may not have started my fascination with greek mythology.
percy is such a good protagonist; sarcastic, funny and charismatic. oh, and his sidekicks– loved them both, annabeth, my girl, and grover. their friendship was so wholesome, the one every kid dreams of, 'cause they just complimented each other so well.
i whole-heartedly believe this book is worth everyone's time, and i don't think i'll ever stop recommending it.
definitely going straight to the favorites folder."
509,510,5,"i honestly really really loved this. I'm not just saying that because its such a well known and loved series, i actually mean it, it was so much fun to read and such an enjoyable story and cast of characters. plus, i jusy recently became obsessed with the TV series Atlantis (i finished it and am so depressed there are only two seasons :""( crying) and so hearing all these characters mentioned that are featured in the show was super exciting!!"
510,511,5,4.5 stars (but worthy of the Goodreads 5) this was SO MUCH FUN to revisit over 10 years later! I thoroughly enjoyed myself and can’t wait to continue on with the series. Look out for a reading vlog coming to bookishpotatoes soon!!
511,512,5,I just had to re read this series and mwah they still hit the spot. Absolute masterpiece.
512,513,5,"This book is perfect, fuck you."
513,514,5,yes I am just starting this series when everyone else read it when they were like 9. and what about it??!
514,515,5,"So I ask myself, why haven't read this sooner? It's. So. Damn. Good. I literally couldn't put it away, and I can't wait to start the next one. I had to pause reading so many times tho, to look up Greek mythology and just get lost in everything, you can argue the book itself is not so deep, but there's so much backstory out there. Camp Half-Blood for the win!"
515,516,5,Am i obsessed with greek mythology? Hell yea😻
516,517,5,"Why did it take me so long to pick this up? I feel like I've been missing out on so much. Anyway, I really enjoyed this book. I thought it would maybe be a little too childish but I ended up being hooked. The writing was great and it was surprisingly amusing. Not only were the characters lovable and fun but the concept was really cool and made me even more interested in Greek mythology.
It's a solid start to the series and I have really high expectations going forward."
517,518,5,"First of all, you should know that I made the mistake of watching the movie first before reading the book. And of course, not having known the full book story, I loved the film completely (well of course, Logan Lerman being one of the reasons why). But then I have this friend who has been forcing me to read the series since last year. He told me that the movie is a complete trash compared to the novels.

So now, a year later, here I am, totally hating myself for even liking the movie adaptation of this book. The movie plot was very different from the book. It’s like they just took the characters and wrote a whole new storyline. The adventures, the deaths, the problems, and a lot more were completely different. Even the age of the main characters was wrong. I mean, does Logan Lerman even look like a twelve-year-old? Okay, enough of the complaints and let’s move on to the review.

Percy Jackson is a twelve-year-old sixth grader who is diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. He is irritable, and he couldn’t control his impulsive behavior. The dyslexia made it hard for him to read and understand his lessons and this resulted to failing marks. And so, Percy might be kicked out from his boarding school, again.

And then, one field trip to the museum revealed the truth about him when he was attacked by his math teacher, well actually, a monster disguised as his teacher. He is a demigod, a half-god, son of one of the gods of Olympus. Suddenly, it all became clear that his problems were actually his talents. The dyslexia was due to the fact that his brain is hardwired to understand ancient Greek writings. The ADHD are manifestations of his advanced reflexes, useful in battles. These would all seem to be a good thing if not for the mythical monsters and demons running after him, wanting him dead.

In turns out that he was the prime suspect for a crime done to the most powerful Olympian god, Zeus. But Percy has no clue as to why he was blamed for the theft of the master lightning bolt, Zeus’ most important weapon. Nevertheless, he must go on a quest to find the lightning bolt and prove his innocence before the gods wage war to each other, endangering the mortal world. Together with his friends, he must know who the real suspect was and stop the possible war, in just ten days.

Okay, so as I’ve said the book was very different from the movie. I don’t want to spoil the whole story for those who haven’t read the book yet, so I leave you to your own disappointment when you finally read this book. All I can say is that I don’t know how the movie producers are planning to make sequel since some important events in the book were removed and replaced in the movie.
As for my opinion on the book, I can say that I seriously enjoyed it. I am a big fan of fantasy novels and this one has one special trail that I loved: its reference to Greek mythology. I’ve already talked about how much I am attracted to mythologies in my past post, and so the all the allusions this book have to all those Greek gods and goddesses immediately got me hooked. The story was brimming with intense action sequences that got me more excited. Also, the plot twists would have been surprising, had I not watched the movie first.

Well aside from all the magical stuff, I loved the way it portrayed family problems. Of course, in the book, the demigods have both mortal and god parents. This means that they only spent their life with only one of their parents. And I can empathize with how these characters felt, growing up without my dad. They all struggle with the abandonment they felt. Because of this, they felt the need to seek acceptance and approval from the Olympian gods and goddesses, who are their parents. They even put themselves in dangerous quests just to prove that they are worthy of their parents’ titles.

All in all, I really enjoyed reading the book and I’m hoping to finish all the books in the series before school starts. But I just have one problem. I just can’t help but find Harry Potter similarities in the book. First is Percy’s appearance. He is a twelve-year-old boy with jet-black hair and sea green eyes. Sounds familiar, right? The only things missing are the glasses and the scar. Then their Trio was made up of Annabeth, daughter of Athena—very intelligent girl—and Grover, a satyr who seem to be very cowardly but otherwise, loyal and useful. They somehow remind me of Ron and Hermione. Oh well, maybe this is just my obsession with Harry Potter messing with my head. But seriously, ignoring those parallels, this book is good and very much adventure-filled. It can stand alone and the plot is different from Harry Potter. I give it an overall 4.5/5."
518,519,5,I loved this book so much and am sad I never read it when I was younger.

Okay so maybe my 5 stars is a bit bias as I just finished and I'm so overwhelmed from the ending.

Or maybe it's just an awesomely enjoyable story that I'm so glad I've FINALLY read!

I think this was the first book on goodreads that I ever marked as ""to read"". Thanks Goodreads for recommending it to me! I may not be 13 anymore, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

Is it possible to say the book is so charismatic??? Because it is.

For a tween book- the character development was some of the best I've ever read.

I don't want to write too much for the few that haven't read it. I went int this book not knowing much about it, and I loved it. 3 years ago I saw the movie and thought it was one of the coolest ideas ever. However I wasn't much of a reader so I didn't read the book. I want to hit my past self and make her read this book. I wish I started sooner!

Spoilers in this para:
I knew from my recollection of the movies (which wasn't much, and I was told it was nothing like the books) that Luke wasn't trustworthy. I feel like some scenes in this were put into the second movie- which doesn't make sense. I'm starting to see why the readers have such a strong hate for the movies. Also, I love Logan Lerman but omg why make the cast late teens when the book starts with them being preteens??? Why? It seems just as uncomfortable as casting a 30 year old to play an 18 year old (I'm looking at you, Glee).

This book was so quirky and I loved reading every bit. I find something relatable in each character (maybe not Ares but whatever) and man, the setting of the book??? So cool. I never want to stop reading about Camp Half Blood.

(I totally ship Percebeth but it's so shameful, kill me)

I was honestly shocked at the ending (which sort of makes me feel like an idiot)- I totally thought the set up for the next book would then be living in CHB. I should've seen his decision coming once Anabeth decided she's out (lol). I definitely teared up at the end- okay maybe I sobbed a bit too. I just loved how it turned full circle and he was back in the cabin surrounded by all his friends! Jeez, I'm human, okay!? I feel way too much for these fictional characters.

I know it's odd but I'm tempted to go rewatch the movie just to see what they did wrong.

I will definitely be reading the rest of the series. I'm going to hit up my library ASAP for copies. Will I reread this? YOU BETCHA.

I recommend this to; people who need a goofy story with strong characters and some cool mythology. I didn't hi kid like the Gods that much- but they're so sassy. It's great!

One last thing; when Percy was told a friend will betray him, I immediately thought of Anabeth (sorry). I didn't trust her the entire time and I now regret it (lol)."
521,522,5,"Classificação: 4,5 em 5 Estrelas

Assim que terminei de ler Harry Potter apesar de ter dito durante a minha vida toda que não leria Harry Potter, decidi dar uma oportunidade a outra série que eu disse nunca ler. Percy Jackson. Verdade seja dita que atirei-me de cabeça nesta série. Comprei os dois primeiros livros a bom preço numa feira do livro e depois tive de esperar imenso tempo para ler os restantes. Mas a verdade é: porque não li mais cedo? Acabou por acontecer-me o mesmo que em Harry Potter, arrependimento por ter demorado tanto tempo para ler e descobrir as aventuras de Percy Jackson.

No primeiro livro ""Percy Jackson e os Ladrões do Olimpo"" decidi dar 4,5 estrelas e não as 5 estrelas pois foi-me óbvio quem realmente seria o pai de Percy Jackson. Acho que é óbvio para qualquer um, a capa até é um spoiler para esta parte se tivermos em atenção. A melhor forma de ler esta série é não ter expectativas, ainda bem que não tive spoilers por parte de amigos e pelos filmes. A escrita de Rick Riordan é incrível, simples mas muito viciante. Capítulos pequenos mas que têm sempre muita ação ou algo para descobrirmos. Não é de todo uma leitura aborrecida, é uma aventura do início ao fim.

Não é um livro apenas para quem gosta de mitologia gregra, é um livro para todos. Acho que mesmo que não se goste de mitoligia acabámos por nos envolver com Percy e toda as aventuras em que ele se mete. Gostava imenso de ter lido quando era mais nova, acredito que teria sido muito mais engraçado. Um livro que mistura deuses, gumanos, profecias, deuses, e muito mais, Rick Riordan consegue dar-nos um livro com uma história série e ao mesmo tempo engraçada. Um livro que facilmente encanta jovens e adultos. Com uma personagem interessante e cativante: Percy Jackson.

A melhor parte deste livro é sem dúvida os segredos que só poderemos descobrir ao ler os restantes livros. Acabámos o primeiro livro sabendo quem é o pai de Percy, e agora? Não sabemos, mais uma aventura aguarda-nos no próximo livro. Acho que nunca saberemos tudo acerca de Percy, haverá sempre um ou outro mistério para descobrir. Verdade que Percy consegue ser uma personagem imatura, mas está relacionado com a sua idade e ao facto de descobrir este mundo novo como nós. É de notar que no início temos um Percy e no final temos outro muito diferente e mais crescido. Agora imaginem nos restantes livros.

Os próximos livros serão tão bons ou melhores que este, disso tenho a certeza. Não acredito que o escritor consiga desiludir. Pretendo ler todos os livros do escritor porque adorei imenso a sua escrita, acredito que vou encontrar livros que ficarão na lista de favoritos para sempre. Após terminar de ler Percy Jackson avançarei para as outras séries do escritor e descobrir novas aventuras. Se ainda não leram Percy Jackson não sei do que estão à espera."

I have declared all the Percy Jackson books as some of my all-time favorites, but the truth is, I have not touched these books since middle school. I have only read them once, and I read them when I was young. I'm going to assume somewhere around a decade has probably passed since I first read The Lightning Thief. A lot can change in so many years.

I was hesitant to reread this book. It's one of those novels to which I have so many memories attached--and not just good memories of me enjoying the book. Life memories. Cracking open my brother's crinkled copy, with his name written sloppily on the first page in pen. Speeding through the series during a family holiday gathering, sitting on the floor with a book in hand while playing cards with my cousins. Shyly asking my mom permission to go to Rick Riordan's book tour. Being unable to fully process the fact that I had a book signed by Rick Riordan, who I had seen in person. Scrolling through Pinterest looking for any fan art I could find in order to pass the time while waiting for the new Heroes of Olympus book. Writing very G-rated fanfic. Wishing I had found friends like the ones in these pages. Refusing to get out of bed until dinner because I was a severely depressed middle schooler--but when I was awake, I'd flop over on my stomach beneath the covers and read these books. I remember being able to tell the time without looking at it because I could measure my reading speed via number of Rick Riordan pages consumed.

I know it always seems like a bit much when someone says that [insert whatever here] saved their life, but when rereading this book, I feel like that phrase resonated with me a bit more. Maybe Percy Jackson didn't personally grab me by the hand and rescue me from the woes of adolescence, but it sure did help at times.

This is a book for those who don't always fit in. For those who can't sit still. For those with strong hearts that weren’t meant to be tempered. It is for those who crave friendship and family and adventure. For those who need a place to set free whatever parts of themselves they have hidden.

Oh, my. I have an emotional reread journey ahead of me."

THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD!

So continuing with the series!:)

Full Review:

I highly, highly enjoyed this book! It was such a fun read. I liked all the characters although the Mythology names were a bit confusing to keep track of. But going into this book, I knew I would find the Mythology aspect of it very confusing but I, thankfully, understood most of it!

This book follows our main character, Percy Jackson, who is the Son of the Sea God. He used to go to a boarding-school and has no idea why he can't control his emotions. Most particularly his temper. One day he sees his algebra teacher turn into a monster and try to kill him. He told his mom right away and was soon sent to a camp. This specific camp is for heroes. It's called Camp Half-Blood. Basically, it's a camp where all heroes that are the kids of The Greek Gods go. Percy learns crazy things about his new life but the craziest thing is yet to come. Percy alongside with his best friend, Grover a satyr, and Annabeth, the daughter of Athena, go out on a quest to prevent a war to erupt between the gods!

CHARACTERS: In this book the characters were really good. I loved Percy's character as well as Annabeth's. Although at times, I got a little irritated by Grover. But besides that, I loved all the characters and their personalities except for Clarisse. Clarisse is a big bully, not speaking of her being the daughter of Ares or anything. She is so mean to Percy I hate her!

PLOT: The plot was one of my favorite things about this book. I loved how everything was describes so well and how it was at a good pace and didn't go too fast or too slow. The Plot twists were really good. I loved how Mr. Riordan
Describes everything. It is a very unique plot that is nothing like any other book I have read!

So that concludes why I loved this book so much! I totally would recommend to anyone and everyone:)"
524,525,5,"He empezado el año releyéndome Percy Jackson y es la mejor decisión que he tomado en toda mi vida. Es como volver a casa.

Volver a imaginarme las cabañas del campamento mestizo, el agua cristalina o el olor de las fresas que plantan los hijos de Deméter es increíble. Ojalá estar ahí.

Es que os juro que leer Percy es la mejor decisión que he tomado en toda mi vida, me sigo riendo de chistes y situaciones que ya sé que existen y me sigo sorprendiendo.

Para la gente que viva debajo de una piedra y no tenga ni idea de que va Percy Jackson os lo cuento porque no sé ir hacéis con vuestra vida.

Imaginemos que te han expulsado de 6 colegios. Tienes 12 años y padeces de dislexia y THDA. Conclusión: no das pie con bola en la escuela. ¿Sabes que es lo peor? Que te ocurren cosas muy extrañas que no son tu culpa. Y de repente tú madre te envía a un campamento de verano después de decirte que tu padre es un dios griego. ¿Cómo te quedas? Pues flipando, normal.

Chaval que eres un semidiós y todas las movidas raras que te ocurrían que no podías explicar están relacionadas con los monstruos de la mitología griega que te quieren matar. Así que te vas al campamento a practicar con la espada y compartir vivencias con niños de otros dioses que son tan marginados socialmente como tú 😎🤙🏻

Solo puedo decir que Percy Jackson es un pelinegro sarcástico súper badass. Su mejor amiga es una sabelotodo insufrible. Y si otro mejor amigo es la persona (o ser?) mas gracioso del mundo. ¿Te suena? Pues este es mi trío de oro, a la mierda Harry sorry not sorry.

Bueno y esto es todo, bye ;)"
525,526,5,"This book was so much fun to read! After finishing, I immediately ran out and got the rest of the series. This is a young adult novel about a trouble-making, 12 year-old-boy who learns that his Dad is actually a Greek god. This explains quite a few of the incidents in his life. His world is turned upside down as he is abruptly thrown into a battle between the ancient Greek gods who are now happily residing in America.

This book is a great, classic adventure. It is fun and light-hearted, while also demonstrating great lessons about courage, family and friendship. I’ve seen some negative reviews claiming it’s just a Harry Potter rip-off and I must disagree. While there are certainly similarities, a story about a young hero on a quest with his companions was hardly an original idea of J.K. Rowling’s. If I were to compare, I would say that the Harry Potter series is more complex and aimed at a broader audience, including adults. The Percy Jackson series seems intended for a younger audience but that does not diminish the reading experience one bit.

The book takes familiar myths and tells a creative and new story. Riordan has done a great job writing a family friendly adventure that everyone can enjoy. There are making a movie of this book soon so be sure to read it first!"

Esta saga es parte de mi infancia, parte de mi adolescencia. No puedo no ponerle 5 estrellas. Tengo que ser sincero, esta cosa está llena de clichés y de algunos cuantos diálogos tontos, pero eso creo que es tan solo parte de su esencia. Las escenas de acción y los personajes siguen siendo tan sólidos como los recuerdo y yo me sentí en casa todo el momento.
Valor nostálgico: 100/10




Me encantó este libro desde el principio. Apenas leí la primera hoja supe que me gustaría mucho, que seria un libro que disfrutaría bastante y lo fue.
Amé esta forma de meter la mitología griega en pleno siglo XXI, con todos los monstruos y las localizaciones. La escritura es bastante buena y bueno, la historia.
La historia me gusta mucho, es bastante genial la misión que tiene Percy. Me gusta Percy, por cierto, es un personaje increíble y lleno de personalidad, que tiene bastantes escenas muy buenas en las que es este chico cool y divertido. Oh, Annabeth, ella es increíble, incluso más que Percy.
El conflicto que empieza en este libro, más muchas presentaciones y todo eso... lo hace genial. Me encanta toda la saga, y este es bastante genial también.
Rick Riordan, es asombroso."
528,529,5,"Percy Jackson has had a lot of undeserved misfortune in his life--He never knew his dad, and his mom in attempt for a better life for both of them, married....A totaly jerk. On top of that, he has gotten kicked out of dozens of schools. But he tries to make the best of it, which is a fact I liked about him. The story begins with a bang, when Percy discoveres he is a modern-day son of the Greek god, Posiden.
Yes, the Greek gods actually exisit!
He is sent to Camp Half-Blood, where he trains with other children of the Greek gods (Hades, Ares, ect.)
Percy discovers he is the main suspect in a huge crime: Zues's lightning bolt has been stolen, and he must retrieve before June 21, (That happens to be my birthday, so I thought that was cool.) ...or war on Mount Olympus will begin.
With his friend Grover the satyr and a daughter of Athena, Percy travels around the United States, trying to seek out the lighning bolt without getting addicted to the deadly games in the Lotus Casino, or burnt to a crisp by a fire-breathing poodle.
If you like Greek mytholgy, talking fish, and a wicked sense of humor, you will defenatly LOVE these books.
I certainly did."

Nunca voy a poder poner en palabras lo que significa este libro para mí y eso me rompe mucho las bolas. Pero Percy Jackson fue de los primeros libros que leí por mi cuenta (porque lo encontré en el departamento de mi hermana y se lo robé jiji) y me obsesioné con Percy, con la mitología griega, con la forma de escribir de Riordan y con todas las aventuras que nos describe. Creo que posta soy capaz de irme a las piñas por este libro.
Soy


La primera vez que lo leí, tenía doce años. Aun hoy, con tres años más, sigo sin poder resumir lo que leí y lo maravilloso que me parece el mundo que creó Rick Riordan.

Los personajes, la ambientación, el humor tonto pero que cuando sos más chico, te hace reír un poquito, la forma en que Riordan trae los mitos y los baja a un nivel fanástico sumamente excelente... todo en este libro es una genialidad."
530,531,5,"My rating: 5 stars.

'Percy Jackson y el ladrón del rayo' tiene un lugar muy, pero muy especial en mi corazón. Quiero decir, fue uno de los primeros libros que me hicieron amar el ser lectora y, a su vez, consiguió viciarme de por vida con lo que es la mitología griega. Aunado a eso, me permitió conectar con Poseidón, puesto que gran parte de mi vida fui nadadora y fue el Dios con el que me sentí más familiarizada.

Entonces, con esa previa introducción, me permito comentar que amo este primer libro de la saga de 'Los Dioses del Olimpo'. Siempre que lo releo, no tardo mucho en comérmelo, puesto que es una lectura fácil, rápida y de lo más atrapante. Sencillamente, tiene su toque mágico y magnético.

¿La manera en la que terminas amando a cada uno de los personajes? Dios mío, es aprecio puro y verdadero. Te empapas de sus personalidades, de sus sentimientos, de sus esencias y terminas encantándote con los susodichos. Y claro, ¿cómo no me sucedería eso con Percy, Annabeth, Grover y Quirón? Son mi lugar seguro.

Y bien, habiendo explicado lo anterior, por supuesto que te recomendaría que lo leas. ¡No hay edad para leértelo, solo hazlo y disfrútalo!"
531,532,5,"What a unique concept! Rick Riordan's writing is so refreshing and funny. Great, easy going style. His book openings (first sentence, first paragraph, first chapter) are some of the very best.

Great series!

Re-read April 2016

I liked the Lightning Thief even more so the second time. It's an amazing take on the well-known mythological tales. Rick Riordan makes them modern, interesting and totally hillarious. The plot moves fast and is full of action and mystery.

While this is an MG/YA book, twere so many funny things in there that only adults can appreciate: a hotel in Vegas where you check in and stay forever (Hotel California by the Eagles), Woodstock etc etc. So many things like those are weaved in throughout this world that you will laugh non-stop. Guaranteed!

This is a great book and an awesome start to the series. All of Rick Riordan's books are among my son's favorites (he's read them all) so I plan to catch up with him."

(rating based on enjoyment and characters)

(SPOILER FREE)

Since this is a middle grade book, I predicted the ending about 35% into the book and I'm okay with that because I'm 16 years old and reading a book that's geared towards the brain capacity of 10 year olds. Having said that, I usually hate middle grade books because the characters are usually very naive and the only thing that gets them anywhere in the end is their sheer stubbornness and coincidence. This here was not the case at all. I really liked the characters, Percy was so funny and so was Grover. Surprisingly I also really liked Anabeth and this is surprising to me because I watched the movie (ages ago when it first came out) and I didn't remember any of the plot, the only thing I remember from that movie is how Anabeth annoyed me so much but as they say the book is always better than the movie.

I will definitely be continuing on with the series and I'm excited to get to the next book."

Reread, 22/05/2020

It's been so many years since I've first read percy Jackson and I still love it. The first time Percy realized he was so much more than just a troubled kid, the first time he met Annabeth, all the You drool in your sleep jokes. It's all coming back to me, and boy, nostalgia. I wasn't sure before if my feelings for this book has changed, but after reading it in no more than four hours, I can say for sure that even if I read it over a thousand times, I wouldn't get tired of it,

Annabeth chase and her stormy gray eyes, her tenacity and strength, its hard to imagine them as twelve year old children when they've gone through so much already. This reread has been long overdue as it is, and since the TV series is going to happen, might as well as binge the whole thing. I'm so excited to visit this amazing universe once again! :D"
534,535,5,"So, SO good! I don't think I've enjoyed a middle grade novel this much since Harry Potter (no joke!). Percy has so much courage and so much snark--I loved it!

The voice was what hooked me from the opening page, and then the characters drew me in all the way. Once the world was fully created before my eyes, I could not put this novel down. I love how Rioran drops in all the Greek myths--I had so much fun identifying things before Percy figured stuff out.

What really got me, though, was that it had so many nice twists and turns! I loved figuring out who the bad guys were, what the prophecy referred to, and seeing it all set up for Major Epic-ness in later novels!

If you're looking for some great adventure, the sort of lovable hero who just barely scrapes by, or a world of gods and goddesses, be sure to read THE LIGHTNING THIEF!"
535,536,5,"Necesito más...
¡SON LAS DOS DE LA MAÑANA, CLARAMENTE NO PUEDO PROCESAR LO QUE ACABA DE SUCEDER!
Me encanta el humor de Percy.
Pensé que iba a ser demasiado introductorio, pero me enganche desde la primera página.
Me muero por continuar con la saga..."
536,537,5,"""Al mar no le gusta que lo contengan.""

I just have a lot of feelings. Y eso es todo.
Sentí una nostalgia extraña leyéndolo, porque es como si me recordara a cuando leí los dos últimos libros de Harry antes de que salieran las películas. Ese final hace querer tragarte toda la saga en dos días. Es que... Rick, ya te convertiste en mi único héroe en este lío en pocas páginas.

Me reí múltiples veces y que Percy se ría tanto de sus desgracias es hermoso. No veo la hora de seguir, pero esta vez en físico. No estoy decepcionada en absoluto. El horror que cometieron con la adaptación jugó a favor enormemente. Cuánto lamento no haber empezado esta saga apenas salió en mi país... Pero, por suerte, hay de Rick para rato (al menos para mí)."
537,538,5,"So I apparently never reviewed this when I read it the first time, oops 🙊

This is such a fun book. Rick Riordan's sense of humor in his writing is amazing. I always love books that make me laugh. And these books taught me what I know of mythology 💙 (I need to do more extensive reading on the myths still, but maybe this summer 😏).

I'd forgotten just how much the movie changes/deviates from the book. Why wouldn't they stay loyal to the book?! It's a goldmine of excellent plot & drama with a deeper over-arcing plot to carry through the series 🙌 I do adore Logan Lerman as Percy (even though he's definitely 12) & Pierce Brosnan as Chiron though 💞

Anywho, I love this book and this series!! Onto 😁"
538,539,5,"I think this is officially the series I have reread the most in my entire life, and I have no regrets. I cannot believe I've read this book four times - I still remember my first time consuming the physical paperback (while eating a meal and getting totally distracted from my food, which is quite a feat because I'm certain the food was delicious) and loving every moment.

Now, I would reread the rest of the series (I probably will end up rereading one of them anyway), but I should move on to reading new novels and reducing the large number of books on my TBR because I've noticed a habit of reverting back to old favorites at the beginning of every reading challenge — which isn't necessarily a bad thing, though I think I should take the leap and try new things in the new year."
539,540,5,"The Lightening Thief by Rick Riordan was published by Disney Hyperion Books in 2006 and has 375 pages.

What a fun book!  This is exactly what middle grade fiction should be and it is obvious why this series has been so very succussful.

The Lightening Thief introduces readers to Percy Jackson.  This is the story of a 12 year old boy with a somewhat tumultuous past.  Readers follow Percy as he goes on a quest to keep the gods from going to war against each other.  

Percy's story is inventive and humorous.  Riordan does an amazing job of introducing Greek mythology in a modern format that is sure to keep young readers interested.  

Recommended for fans of mythology and middle grade fiction.  You won't be able to put this one down."
540,541,5,"**SCREAMING IN ANCIENT GREEK**

okay so I read ""the lightning thief"" about 3 years ago, but I re-read it at least once a year. the re-read of 2021 is done now.

I think I'll never stop getting amazed by riordan's artwork.

I'd give anything to read that book for the first time once again!! ⚡

I absolutely LOVED how uncle rick made the world (which is btw real) so magical and mixed that with the world of greek MYTHOLOGY.

- greek mythology. ✨periodt✨
- annabeth chase. just annabeth chase

see ya"
541,542,5,Started reading this series because I'm interested in Greek and Roman mythology. I know this is for young readers but I do really love the Greek and Roman mythology and I'll read anything that involves this subject. This is similar to a series that I've been reading more of the adult theme The Dark-Hunters series and Chronicles of Nick. I will also be reading Kane Chronicles and The Heroes of Olympus since it's a spin-off of Percy Jackson and the Olympians and I will also be looking forward to read The Hidden Oracles The trials of Apollo another spin-off from Percy Jackson and The Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus....
542,543,5,"No words! I'm totally amazed!

I'm sure this is just the beginning of a wonderful series. I loved the world created, the Gods, the adventures, the humor...everything. It's very well written and created, on a way that you can't stop reading and then you realise that you are inside the story and also you are part of it.



Well, actually I don't want to be helped...I'll just continue reading the books and fangirling all alone... hehe."
543,544,5,"Why did I wait so long to read this book? Oh yeah, I saw the movies and thought they were... ok... but nothing special.
I really want to read the Magnus Chase series though and literally EVERYBODY adviced me to read the Percy Jackson series before I pick up the Magnus Chase books, so I finally listened :')

I was expecting a slowpaced, kind of boring book to be honest.
What I got was a fast paced, action packed whirlwind of a book, with excellently written characters and a plotline that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time!

Oh and... monsters <3

I've already started on Sea of Monsters :D"
544,545,5,"Il n'y a pas assez de mots dans la langue française pour exprimer l'amour que je ressens envers cette série, et ce livre en particulier. Le Voleur de Foudre est définitivement la raison pour laquelle j'ai développé une passion pour la mythologie et pour l'auteur, Rick Riordan, que j'adore encore aujourd'hui.

Je recommande ce livre à tous ceux qui aimeraient commencer à lire, que ce soit des enfants, des adolescents ou des adultes. Je pense que tous peuvent se retrouver dans ce récit, que ce soit par rapport aux personnages, aux thématiques, à l'humour, à l'action...

Bref, je ne vais pas m'étendre, mais ce livre est un classique pour moi."

Al principio debo decir que no sabía si leerla ya que, había visto la película un montón de veces porque me gusta. Pero, no sé parece en nada. Y cuando digo ""en nada"" es porque literalmente no se parece en nada.
El libro está lleno de aventuras, drama y amistad. Y que la historia sea sobre la mitología griega lo hace aún más interesante todo su mundo.
Sin embargo, como me vi la película ya sabía quién era el traidor aquí. Aún así me emocionó todo eso porque hubo muchas cosas que en la película no salió. Así que, disfrute el libro de principio a fin. ¡Me encantó!"
546,547,5,"This is one of the typical why-didn't-I-start-reading-this-sooner? situations. I put off reading this book because I thought it would not interest me. And what did I learn: I should probably stop thinking...
The first thing that I really liked was the Greek mythology theme and because of that it was so refreshing (no vampires, no witches etc.). The second thing that I really liked was, of course, the main character Percy Jackson and for two things: male main character and his personality.
This book is filled with tension, action & humor and it's just amazing.
Just go and read it now !"
547,548,5,"LOVE this series. Got my 10-yr-old friend into them and he's loving it, too. I'm reading them a 2nd time so I can remember the details because he loves talking it over with me. I'm having a ball! Super fun books about a young modern boy who finds out that the Greek myths aren't so fantastical after all. Adventure, humor, friendship, challenge, these books have it all. And are even a bit educational underneath the good fun."
548,549,5,"I'm so in love with this kid!I must say there is something Harry Potterish about this series...at least judging by first book.The whole three friends,hero,wise girl thing.

Somehow it's harder to write a review for a book you love than a book you hate because you're struggling to convey just how much you adore it. Words never seem enough so I'll just say a few things: first it's for all ages. Both my parents and siblings have read it as well. Secondly, it's perfect for you if you love puns and sarcastic humor. To finish my review: just pick it up please. I hope you'll love it."
551,552,5,"Read this book first then saw the movie!
DON'T DO THIS.
The book is much better.
The hero is not the most confident young man and it was incredible what he was able to achieve given his life so far.
A great story that I have to say personally the hero Percy reminded me a little of Harry Potter (from the first two books).

2020 is turning out to be the year of the re-reads for me. PJO (and, later, HOO) was my favourite series growing up, and it was also my first-ever (internet) fandom. as a kid, i was obsessed with Greek Mythology, and PJO made me fall in love with it even more. a couple of days ago, i realised that it had been, like, six years since my last re-read of the original series, so i decided to put everything else on pause and focus on binge-reading it. spoiler alert: it was an extremely good decision.

Percy is one of my favourite main characters of all time. when this series first came out (late 2000s), most of the middle-grade / young-adult books that i came across – and i almost exclusively read fantasy back then – featured the “i’m not like other girls” trope. it felt like authors were all trying so hard to make their MCs seem and , so hard that they all ended up essentially doing the same thing anyway. whilst PJO wasn’t necessarily the most original series i had ever read, i remember being pleasantly surprised by twelve-year-old troublemaker Percy Jackson. he was such a refreshing protagonist, the original Relatable MC. i love him so much.



is far from perfect, and it’s probably my least favourite of the series, but i still love it with all of my heart. i still love this world and these characters so much – i forgot how precious Percy and Annabeth’s tentative friendship at the beginning of the series is. i sort of regret not re-reading this sooner. the easiest five stars i’ve ever given, i can’t wait for the Disney+ tv series.

p.s. the Italian / Indonesian covers are THE BEST."
596,597,5,"I absolutely adore this book! It's a simple story that gave me a break from sometimes too complicated books and their overwhelming worldbuilding. I love how to author explains Western Civilization and how it's connected to Greece's mythical world. Generally, it's such a great idea to bring the past myths to the present, and the author did an excellent job explaining every little detail.
Percy or ""Perseus"" is the type of character you have to like. He's brave, smart and would do anything to protect his family and friends. It's a hell of a ride with this character and his quest! So much trouble for a young hero. But that's what makes it so fun and, at the same time, makes you feel for this character.
The other characters Annabeth another half-blood, and Groover, the funniest Satyr, are an excellent addition to the story. Being attacked by monsters from the past and the Underworld brings them closer together, and they form a real friendship with Percy. Suddenly you see how they all work together to overcome several obstacles to follow Percy's quest.
I like how Percy doesn't automatically adore the gods like the other characters in the book. Somehow he still stays himself, and his hotheaded expressions when talking with other gods are hilarious. They made me laugh so much!
I definitely recommend this book to whoever wants to read a funny and interesting story about a hero, his friends, and his quest."

Euh, c'était grave fun ?? Honnêtement le seul défaut que je pointe c'est que ça aurait dû être un tout petit peu plus long ne serait-ce que pour les descriptions, mais je comprends que ce ne soit pas possible vu que c'est Percy qui raconte.

En parlant de Percy je l'ai vraiment trouvé génial et adorable avec sa mère et j'ai envie de donner une cannette à Grover. Je ne sais pas trop quoi penser d'Annabeth, je l'aime bien et j'ai hâte de voir son évolution.

J'ai adoré tous les rebondissements un peu barrés qu'il y avait (le parc d'attractions 💀), les très nombreux liens avec la mythologie grecque et l'adaptation plutôt originale de l'Olympe à New-York, des Enfers à LA....

Bref, j'ai hâte de lire la suite !"

No pude evitar pensar en lo que Percy se convertirá, especialmente cuando Percy conoce a Poseidon y habla del semblante de su cara diciendo que es el mismo de él que suele clasificarlo como un busca problemas y me hace recordar que luego para las personas que conocer a Percy piensan que es este semidios serio y rudo pero es todo lo contrario. Bueno, les amo mucho."

I really enjoyed rereading this one. I originally saw the movie a while back before I knew there were books. This was a great start to a series and I'm excited to see where Rick Riordan takes this series. I was connected to the store and I really felt for the characters. It was a well written Middle grade book, and I will definitely continue the series.

You know how everyone has sappy and beautiful backstory on their reviews of Harry Potter? Yeah that's what's about to happen with this book.





I don't actually remember this, but my friend does. I reread Harry Potter with this friend allllll the time. As a kid in primary school with 1.5 friends does. Apparently, one day, I rocked up to school and my friend was like 'something something Harry Potter, etc.' and I was like 'I'm OVER Harry Potter. I like now.' And she was like 'Oh yeah?' Flash to a number of years later, the series is concluding, that friend has read them all, my sibling's have read them all, my mum's read them all.

This series means so much to me. It's like top tier, alongside Harry Potter. And honestly it's so funny to me every time J.K. Rowling does anything, cause there's an uproar, and then people are like 'You should read Percy Jackson'. Well, yes, thank you, I will go reread them for the 4th time, what a great idea *applause*.

Percy Jackson was a regular problems. After being expelled for the 6th time in six years, he and his mother (the literal best person in the universe, but I digress) go to their holiday spot for a vacation. But after being in a car crash with the Minotaur as the cause, he heads to Camp Halfblood, with his best friend who is actually a satyr.

He's then sent on a quest to return Zeus's master bolt so that World War III doesn't start, and the world basically ends.

You know, the usual Summer Camp.

which like, I know isn't the best now but it gets better later on trust me

Obviously the characters and plot are amazing, and obviously the mythos aspect is great, but in this book specifically it felt like Rick was cramming all the myths he could into one book, not letting the story hold its own wait; and just introducing concepts that would eventually be solved in less than a chapter.

- Dyslexic, ADHD, son of Poseidon, a true millennial hero (let’s face it, this book is 15 years old, it’s not a spoiler anymore)

- Dyslexic, probably has ADHD, daughter of Athena

- Satyr, keeper, wants to be a searcher (search for the God Pan)

- Was Percy’s Latin teacher, centaur, teaches demigods how to not be killed

- Son of Hermes, swordsman

- Literally like, the best mother ever. Ever. Also, the blue food was a way to rebel against Gabe.

- Literally like, the worst person ever. Ever.
- camp director, god of wine etc, also the one incident where he called Percy his real name

- Daughter of Ares, is like a major ‘punk’ at the start

- Is mentioned enough that I’m putting her on the list, daughter of Zeus. Also, Percy having a vision of Thalia is weirdly cool forshadowing.

Below are just some random thoughts that I had through this book:

Do you want a war?
Lol, no, imagine the paperwork
Cool, cool, cool, please don’t kill me, also play with your dog
Percy and Annabeth's relationship was utter perfection. How it grows from 'I'm literally just tolerating you because you get me out of camp' to 'I would literally pick you over my mother' is like the greatest. And I do truly love how, because they're 12, and met like 10 days ago, it doesn't cut straight to romance. They do become friends first and stay that way for many years.





I love this series a lot. A lot. Like wayyyy too much.

And you shall fail to save what matters most in the end” This book is a really good book due to the reason that at any moment a new pho can appear and prevent Percy Jackson from reaching the underworld and saving his mother and clearing his name from being the lightning thief. For example it showed the details of the adventures that the three characters have went on and had you hanging on the edge of your seat if the hero’s would make it out alive and be one step closer to reaching the underworld. In other words this book has a great sense of humor that grabs the attention of the reader and makes them want to keep on reading. In addition the author has a great sense of pulling the imagination out of the reader's mind and allowing there imagination to run wild from them reading about the animals and Gods of the book. Lastly this book has a great way of detailing the resolution showing how Percy defeating Luke and taking the lightning bolt back to Olympas and returning it to Zeus to clear his name and prevent a war amongst the Gods."

623,624,5,"Primero que nada no se por que rayos había aplazado tanto este libro, y ahora que lo he acabado no tengo la segunda parte :( creo que tengo la mala costumbre de pensar que los libros con buenas criticas no van a gustarme y la verdad es que no se por que.

Con este libro me lleve grandes sorpresas, la manera en la que el autor ha escrito la historia es súper fascinante por que, es fácil de leer, te divierte, los diálogos son bien claros y para nada confusos, y los personajes son exactos para la historia. Ni una pagina me ah aburrido y eso me ha gustado.

Conocemos a Percy Jackson un niño que tiene problemas de THDA y Dislexia, tiene problemas en los colegios en lo que esta y cambia continuamente pero él no sabe por que es así, piensa que ya es su naturaleza pero lo que no sabe es que su padre es un Dios griego. Este personaje me ha caído muy bien, es bastante carismático y ingenioso y las ocurrencia en sus respuestas me han gustado mucho. Al parecer él es la única persona que no sabe nada de su familia por parte de padre y de las cosas básicas que de saber un semidiós.

Sus amigos Annabeth y Grover son personajes que si bien son bastante distintos caen muy bien, son fieles a Percy y hacen un excelente trio de amigos, cada aventura que pasan juntos es bastante emocionante. Los demás personajes, los secundarios son personajes que llegas a conocer bien, pero la verdad es que no puedes tener una idea clara sobre ellos. Tienden como a impresionarte.

Una de las cosas que me ha gustado de este libro es la manera en la que están escritos los capítulos, son fáciles de leer, no te aburres para nada, y el autor lo ha escrito todo tan bien sin enredar las cosas, que pienso que no es nada fácil ya que pues estamos hablando de mitología griega lo que me lleva a otra cosa que me ha gustado.

Realmente he aprendido mucho con este libro, había leído cosas sobre este tema pero creo que el contexto de como lo he leído es que me ha parecido tedioso de leerlo, pero aquí no, aquí comprendí muchas cosas que me gustaron, que logre entender y que ahora soy capaz de hablar, el autor lo ah explicado muy claro y sin enredos, que si en estos momentos me preguntas puedo hablar del árbol genealógico de los dioses griegos, esto la verdad es que me ha fascinado, siempre aprendes mucho con los libros pero este ha sido especial con respecto a este tema.

Definitivamente me quede con ganas de mas, quiero seguir leyendo que pasa, por que hay temas que me quedaron dudas y otros que quisiera descubrir y que se van a desarrollar mas, una de las que mas me llamo la atención fue la relación que tienen el papa y la mama de Percy, digo me reúso a pensar que el autor lo va a dejar así de frio, nada mas en el pasado y que solo de esa relación haya nacido Percy, creo que ahí tiene que ver algo mas emocionante. Espero no llevarme una decepción.

Ese final ah sido muy lindo, no se, pienso que es distinto y que de verdad es maravilloso, no es nada fuera de lo normal pero es que me ha parecido muy adecuado para el libro, aparte de las cosas que pasan con anterioridad a eso es como, Rayos no me lo imaginaba.

Recomendable: SI SUPER RECOMENDABLE es una lectura ligera que de verdad te la pasas súper bien, pero que lo mas importante por lo menos para mi es que aprendes, de verdad aprendes mucho y eso le da un plus mucho mejor, te dan ganas de seguir leyendo los demás libros, por lo menos yo tengo muchas ganas de seguir con esta saga, de seguro que no va a decepcionarte si le das una oportunidad."

Now that was a fun ride.

I don't really know how to start this review. I actually never quite know how to do it but this time I really don't know. I mean, so much happened in this book... now I'm thinking that could be a good kick-off.

SO MUCH happened in this book.

And all of it was so well crafted and near perfect.

I mean, I had a hard time taking the story seriously through the first chapter or so. For a while, it even got me thinking the world Rick Riordan created wouldn't get me hooked after all, it was so childish...

Boy, was I WRONG.

Midway through the second chapter, I knew I wouldn't be able to stop reading until the end. And it was mainly because, after only two short chapters, I was already attached to Percy Jackson.

Percy is not only a loveable and interesting character, but he's such a good narrator that I even found him to be relatable, even though I couldn't be less like him. Okay, sometimes he came off as unrealistically brave... but as I do with most of my favorite literary characters, I psychoanalyzed the kid... sort of... okay no, but I came to the conclusion that, since he felt so miserable and isolated leading his old life, he might've had an easier time adapting to his new one than many. Anyway, his character didn't feel forced and that's what's important. A good percentage of a good book is a good main character, and Rick Riordan got that better than right.

Other than Percy, the only other character I really loved was Annabeth (duh!), but I think that might be due to my not knowing the rest of the characters as well yet. And Grover... well, he gave me some really Ron Weasley vibes (though I know their situations are extremely different) and sometimes he made me face-palm myself really bad... in spite of that, I still felt sorry and happy for him at the end.

Also, fetus Percabeth is the most adorable thing ever.

Now on to the Gods. I mean, whoa. I've read books and thought ""this must have taken a lot of research!"" but this is a whole other level. Like, I knew next to nothing about Greek mythology before starting this book, and now I've learned a lot of things and I'm willing to do some research on it myself. On a sidenote, a friend of mine aced her university test on the Odissey without reading it because she'd read the whole PJ series. Absolutely brilliant, Rick Riordan.

I know this is a book meant for kids, so it's not meant to be really scary, but it even had some really spooky descriptions, and I loved that. I actually wished there were more scary parts. But was really stood out were the action scenes and the interactions between the characters. The latter could be so funny and/or so touching and... I don't know. Like, really, it surpassed my highest expectations and if I don't give it the whole five stars, it's because it lacked some secondary character-development or something, but that's technical stuff and I swear, I enjoyed The Lightning Thief SO MUCH I don't have the slightest idea how I'm going to survive a week before getting my hands on Sea of Monsters, I seriously don't know."

Creo que es la tercera vez que leo este libro y siempre la abandono y nunca sigo con la saga. Toda la culpa la tiene las portadas nuevas. Porque tengo los dos primeros libros en físico en español de las ediciones viejas y por ende no combinan con las nuevas. Pero ahora que desde el año pasado básicamente respiro audiolibros, me di cuenta que podía retomar la saga y continuarla en audiolibros (además me di cuenta que las ediciones en inglés viejas son como las nuestras viejas y tal vez pueda completar la saga en mis estanterías en ambos idiomas🤩).
Por suerte, este mes empezó el @campamentomestizochallenge y uno de lo retos era leer el primer libro de la saga. No sé si esta iniciativa va a seguir el mes que viene -ya no me acuerdo pero sé que estaba en las reglas- pero me vendría muy bien leer un libro de Percy por mes. Veremos cómo nos va.

Bueno, ahora a lo que nos compete.
Este libro tiene todo lo que me gusta. Es middlegrade, hay una quest, es decir, hay una misión, y tiene mitología griega. Más no se le puede pedir🤩
Por otro lado, ya deben saber que yo y la fantasía urbana recién nos estamos conociendo pero no siempre congeniamos. Yo no recordaba que esto también es fantasía urbana. Pero el leerlo me re sirvió para identificar por qué me gustaba tanto este libro perteneciendo a ese subgénero. Y es que con este libro, con el mundo basado en mitología griega que Riordan se mandó, la parte ""urbana"" siento que no es lo que predomina. La mitología embellece toda la historia así que el aspecto de fantasía urbana no me molesta tanto con estos libros.

Lo que más me gusta de estos libros no es solo la mitología (aunque en gran parte sí), sino también el humor de los personajes, y sobre todo el de Percy. Siempre me hace muy bien al alma este niño.
Y la relación entre Percy y su mamá es una de las más preciosas en la literatura juvenil. No la recordaba así, tan linda, pero en esta relectura supe disfrutarla y apreciarla más.






En resumen, una relectura super entretenida y amena, justo para estos tiempos que estamos pasando. Siento que los middlegrade son excelentes para leer en estos momentos. Lleno de humor, acción, aventura y muchos monstruos. Con unos personajes queribles y entrañables. Y con un inglés super fácil para los que estén buscando un libro para empezar con el idioma.

627,628,5,"My Rating: 5 stars!

Percy Jackson is just a normal kid, or so he thinks. When he gets expelled from his 6th school and things start to go horribly wrong, Percy's mom decides it's time to find out more about his mysterious past and who his father is. Percy is soon tasked with stopping a war between the gods with his two friends, Annabeth, a demigod daughter of Athena, and Grover, a satyr on the hunt for his searcher's license. Will Percy be able to stop a catastrophic war between the gods?



- I am so, so, glad I'm rereading this! came out this year, as you may know, and it's the end of an era (my childhood, to be exact), and what way to end it all off with a reread of all of the main series books? Another reason why I want to reread these all is because this year sucks and these books provide me great joy.

- In the first bit of the book, I found Annabeth a bit annoying, but then I realized that that's just how 6th graders act. It also gave me a moment of ""oh my god, is that how I acted when I was in 6th grade?"". In the end, it's just a perfect description of a child trying to figure out her feelings.

- Rick Riordan is known for being a master of mythology, and rightfully so. He works in Greek gods and monsters so flawlessly and amazingly. It's also left a lasting impression on me (and, undoubtedly, thousands of kids across the world as well) and this is what got me into mythology.

- This book is full of little moments where every little kid can relate, because, hey, middle school sucks! The world-building was fantastic and it's perfect for every little kid to understand and to get lost in. I even get lost in this easily now, and it's been a bit since I was in middle school! The plot is easy to follow and captivating, and I just love every aspect of the story.

- Either way, this book has the same nostalgic comfort as a or a reread. I love it, and it will always have a special place in my heart.

628,629,5,"“I'd love to tell you I had some deep revelation on my way down, that I came to terms with my own mortality, laughed in the face of death, etcetera. The truth? My only thought was: Aaaaggghhhhh!”

 I literally don't know where to start, you know how there are some books that just bring a smile to your face whenever you pick them up? Well these Percy Jackson and The Olympians' books are the biggest smile conjurers in my bookshelves. I hold them specially close to my heart.

 Almost everyone knows the story, whether it's because you've watched the movies (which are terrible, I recommend you drop them right now and pick up the books) or you've heard about these books, or like me, you've already read them. But in case you don't, this is basically it: Percy Jackson doesn't do well at school, he has a hard time concentrating and his dyslexia makes reading for him very hard, on top of that his mother is married to a douchebag and they don't have much money. What he doesn't know is that he is really a Half-Blood, as in half greek god, half human. His real father is Poseidon and a lot of things are about to change for him.



 I can't point a single thing and name it what I love the most about these books, sometimes it's the characters or the writing style, sometimes it's the hilarious way in which Riodan merges greek mythology with pop culture and sometimes it's the aesthetic. It has some clichés, and I'll admit the first time I read the summary I thought it looked suspiciously similar to But it's a diferent experience entirely, even though they deal with similar themes.

 I don't want to spoil anything, I can only say, that I loved these books as when I was little and I love them now, I just can't recommend them enough, if you have kids, if you're a kid, if you were a kid you should read them, you won't regret it."
629,630,5,"This review can also be found here

I love this book. Seriously, everything about it is just amazing. From the characters to the plot to the fact that it revolves around Greek Mythology, this book had me hooked from the first page. I had first read this book before I became a blogger, but decided I wanted to re-read it because I finally purchased the rest of the series and I loved it just as much the second time around and I still found myself engaged in the story even though I already knew what happens.

The storyline in this book is just fantastic. It's full of adventure and action with a lot of friendship and thrown right in. I've always been interested in mythology and this book really captured my attention. The myths that were used in the book just added to the overall excitement of the story for me. From the Minotaur to chimaera, Rick Riordan really nailed the right amount of suspense, action and information.

I love almost all of the characters as well. Percy is the underdog and I found myself rooting for him to succeed because the kids in middle school and he's thrown into a world where the stories he's been studying turn out to be real instead of just myths and he goes in fighting and he's prepared to die to save what's important to him. Then there's Grover. He's just so funny and awkward and the story just wouldn't be the same without him. Annabeth is one of my favorites as well. She's smart and strong and she doesn't need a man to swoop in and save her. The girl knows how to kick butt and she does.

If you're a fan of mythology and middle grade stories that combine action and adventure with characters who don't give up no matter what, then I definitely think you should give this book a chance. It's a quick read that will have you flipping pages just to find out what happens to Percy and his friends."
630,631,5,"**Confession**

I watched the movie before even knowing the book/series even existed. Gods, it was awful.

The movie, mind you. Not the book.

Apparently, Rick Riordan sold the movie rights so as to increase his book sales (that was a pretty good marketing) but the weird thing is, he doesn't even see the movie o_o

When a friend recommended me the series (I tend to ignore recommendations) I was stumped. ""That ridiculous awful movie got a book written? Nuh-uh, I am not gonna read it."" At that time, I was ignorant on the matter that sometimes movies don't always follow the exact storyline in the books. So I ignored PJ until 2013, end of October. The month I caved in.

Turns out I like everything Percy Jackson had to offer. The book was different. REALLY different from the movie (yay for that).

I loveeee his narration. He's sometimes stupid and slow on the uptake but hey, I WOULD too. I'll probably go in a shock processing through what he had gone through. I mean, Greek Gods??????? In America??????

Sure, Percy's whiny sometimes but somehow, he didn't annoy me so much. I ended up smiling ad laughing along with him as he goes through his battles with monsters and Annabeth. She's kick ass, smart and headstrong. She stood out in every single way. Oh hell what am I talking about? Everything and everyone in this series stood out. Basically nine of them are forgettable.

Don't even get me started on the humour.

They cracked me up. I didn't giggle reading them. I laughed. Belly-laughed, in fact. For a person who laugh at every stupid, lame joke. This one got me hard.


Overall, I love this series. Sometimes the Gods's, Goddesses' s, and monsters' s motives are too over-repeated in the coming books but then, theyre all still a fun and memorable read.

I seriously thought I would change my mind after a year of finishing the whole thing But nope, I re-read all the books and am still loving it!"
631,632,5,"I know that I am really behind the times when it comes to this series. Everyone read these when they were growing up and I’ve only picked them up this year as a twenty year old and honestly, that made me nervous going in. I didn’t think I’d connect with the characters because they’re like twelve in this book and I thought the plot wouldn’t be the best. BUT, I’ve never been so wrong!

This book was absolutely delightful! The plot was so interesting and so informative! I don’t really know anything about the Greek Gods so I found the mythology in this book so interesting and generally enjoyed reading about it so much! Apart from that, the rest of the plot was also so enjoyable and I just had so much fun with it! This book went to places that I didn’t think it would and was just a great heist story!

Although, I will say, the characters were definitely my favourite part of this story! Percy was just the most sarcastic, funny character I’ve ever read from the perspective of. But, he’s also so compassionate and panicked about what is going on and I think Riordan did an amazing job at keeping that balance! Annabeth was also a character I really enjoyed, I loved her dynamic with Percy throughout this book and I just found her quite a sad character, her backstory was so sad yet she’s this strong little warrior who I absolutely adore! Grover also was just so humerus and even though his job is to protect Percy, you can tell he truly cares for his friend, I also loved their dynamic.

Like I said before, I found the Gods so fun in this book! It was really good to see an imagining of what they’re like especially Hades, I’ve also been interested by Hades and I thought his characterisation in this book was fantastic! Zeus was definitely written how I imagined he would be and I can’t wait to continue learning about him!

Overall, The Lightning Thief was an absolute delight and I’m so sad that I haven’t picked it up before now! And I can’t wait to carry on!"
632,633,5,"No voy a mentir diciendo que siempre había pensado leer esta saga. Resulta que soy bastante susceptible y Tiktok logra que lea historias que jamás pensé leer. Por suerte haber comenzado a leer Percy Jackson and the Olympians fue una de mis mejores decisiones del año.

El hype que rodea a esta saga hace años es súper bien merecida. Aún siendo un middle grade, con sus capítulos cíclicos y miniconflictos durante el desarrollo del conflicto principal no sentí para nada que fuese una historia infantil. A diferencia de todos los middle grades que llevo leidos hasta ahora (Que son un montón porque amo el género como lectora adulta) siento que los personajes en esta historia están mucho más desarrollados, con backgrounds mucho más oscuros y problemáticos, y personalidades bien marcadas. Esto mismo se puede identificar en la trama principal, los conflictos son oscuros y muy bien trabajados. Definitivamente este libro es una gran muestra del trabajo previo que ha realizado el autor.

Y siguiendo este último comentario no puedo dejar de mencionar lo mucho que se puede aprender durante la lectura. Sin tomarnos por tontos pero brindándonos la información necesaria para poder comprender lo que sucede, el autor incorpora personajes y situaciones que nos proveen con explicaciones simples sobre las historias que caracterizan a cada personaje mitológico que aparece en el camino de Percy.

Antes de terminar no quiero dejar de mencionar al personaje de Annabeth que me dio años de vida. Sin dudas me hubiese encantado tener un referente así durante mi adolescencia y es por esto que no me voy a cansar de recomendar este libro a todas las personas que estén dispuestas a escucharme hablar forever sobre el lujo que es tenerla dentro de la saga.

Espero poder seguir con el resto de los libros pronto porque me divertí muchísimo leyendo y estoy segura que esto es sólo el comienzo de una nueva obsesión jaja."
633,634,5,"The Lightning Thief

Percy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or control his temper. And lately, being away at boarding school is only getting worse-Percy could have sworn his pre-algebra teacher turned into a monster and tried to kill him. When Percy's mom finds out, she knows it's time that he knew the truth about where he came from, and that he go to the one place he'll be safe. She sends Percy to Camp Half Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island), where he learns that the father he never knew is Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon a mystery unfolds and together with his friends -- one a satyr and the other the demigod daughter of Athena -- Percy sets out on a quest across the United States to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.


Greek mythology? YES PLEASE!!!



They were awesome! Percy is so sarcastic, I love it! And I really liked how the children of each of the gods had unique personalities specific to that god.



The plot flowed nicely. It was fast-paced, with never a dull moment. I kept waiting for some plot points to be resolved, though, and they never were, which was frustrating. But it is a series, so I guess I'll have to read the rest of them!



I absolutely Greek mythology, so this was fabulous! There was quite a bit of explaining of things, that I thought was unnecessary, but it is written for younger kids (who aren't necessarily mythology addicts), so that's understandable. I can't wait to read the rest of this series!

Oh, yes!
Yes
Yes!"

La saga, sebbene tratti prevalentemente di mitologia greca, è ambientata in una New York molto diversa da come siamo soliti a pensarla. Infatti gli dei dell’Olimpo si sono spostati dalla loro terra natia per trasferire il Monte Olimpo al seicentesimo piano dell’Empire State Building, divenendo così simbolo del loro immenso potere.Nel libro il protagonista dodicenne Perseus Jackson scopre la vera natura della sua dislessia e della sua irruenza che lo hanno portato a cambiare scuola più di una volta. Infatti altro non è che un semidio figlio di uno dei più antichi e potenti dei dell’Olimpo: Poseidone.
Un’avventura per ragazzi dai toni accessi, tutt’altro che banale, ma soprattutto non noioso.
Si viene catapultati nella storia quasi da subito e presto iniziamo a leggere della spassosissima impresa che porta Percy, Grover e Annabeth a viaggiare in varie città dell’America per salvare la vita della mamma del ragazzo e per scoprire cosa hanno rubato di tanto importante dall’Olimpo, da far arrabbiare terribilmente Zeus, minacciando di guerra il fratello Ade e altri dei.

Una scrittura travolgente, irresistibile, adorabile, seppur semplice e non così poi articolata. Ma dopotutto è la storia e la mitologia il punto cardine, la chiave di volta che collega tutti gli eventi regalando al lettore un’insaziabile voglia di conoscenza. Impossibile non correre ai vecchi libri di scuola per ristudiare l’Iliade, l’Odissea e tutto ciò che riguarda gli intrighi divini e il Monte Olimpo. Ogni avvenimento in Percy Jackson e gli dei dell’Olimpo è legato perfettamente alla leggenda e ai miti greci, e ogni azione descritta nel libro è rapportato ad essi. Semplicemente… Divino!"
635,636,5,"Long before thrillers and mystery novels, my first love was fantasy and adventure stories. I would dream about the brave heroes, the lost treasures they seek, and the great miracles along the almost impossible quests. At times I would invent a story of my own – whether it was about an Egyptian princess or a young orphan – not always writing them down, but certainly letting them evolve and thrive in my imagination.

I still have these old notebooks, with my little adventures, and perhaps someday I would add a fantasy novel to my literary resume, but for now I suffice with being an enthusiastic reader of this beautiful genre. Therefore, when I heard there was a book that combined fantasy with Greek mythology, which I have always found fascinating, I knew I just had to read it.

The way Riordan had “dressed” the Greek mythology on the western culture was like a tailor-made suit. The gods were impressive and so were the demigods. The way the author explained natural phenomena, human crises, and historical events, with the help of Greek mythology, made me smile.

What I loved most was that these books made me want to read the Greek mythology all over again – and if that same desire rises with some of the kids who read Riordan’s books, this would be an amazing contribution!

His books are so much fun to read, I finished them both within a week. I admit I liked the first book a bit more, as far as the accurate plot and surprising twists (still, I’m a thrillers junky), but I’ll definitely continue reading the rest of the series with pleasure and nostalgia to my own childhood. And how many books can do that?

."
636,637,5,"Well I thought the writing was g-

I was going to do an objective review, but what's the point? How do I review the book, the series that made me a reader? I mean this series is the reason I joined Goodreads, it's the reason I have an unquenchable thirst for more good books, it's the reason I've read such wonderful books that became instant favorites such as Legend, Harry Potter, and Six of Crows just to name a few, it's the reason you can all see my salty two star reviews.

It's even the reason I've made most of my best friends.

These characters are my friends, this fandom is my family, and Camp Half-Blood is my home.

Now I will say something objective about this book and actually 's writing in general; he has a knack for making very relatable and flawed characters. They are all broken, they all have their own personal demons (and literal demons), they all fall sometimes, and they are all human (not always literally human but you get the point)

That to me is Riordan's signature, not the humor (although there is always plenty of that in his books) but his character."

Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief was fantastic. It completely surprised me, delighted me and I simply loved it. It follows the story of Percy Jackson, troubled student who's not only dyslexic, but suffers from attention deficit disorder. In the past six years, he's moved from several different schools and each ending in Percy being asked to leave. He's not intentionally difficult by any means, but strange and unexplained predicaments seem to find him. Percy is a Demigod and the only place the offspring of the Gods can find sanctuary is at Camp Half Blood, and finds himself thrown into a world of mythology. Considering he's only twelve years old, Percy's voice seemed mature beyond his years. He's overwhelmed, needs answers and rightly so. He's not a strong character, but a reliable narrator who's nativity only endeared me further.

Annabeth was troubled. She covered her insecurities with awkward humour which almost always fell flat. Thank goodness for Grover. The Satyr and tin can eating boy who is using the quest to prove his own worth as a protector. He was simply delightful. Although the series falls under the middle grade genre, the Greek mythology was brilliant and it was delivered with humour and sarcasm. It was nothing short of incredible. I'm an instant fan and luckily already have the next two books waiting for me on my bookshelf."
638,639,5,"The fact that I like this book at all defies logic. The fact that I kind of loved it is down right mystifying. I gave the Harry Potter books my best effort but couldn't get into them. I generally don't like Fantasy and I'm not a pre-pubescent boy, so why this one clicked, I'll never know.

My son had been wanting me to read it for months and I kept putting it off assuming it would be a chore and that I would politely tell him it was ""good"" regardless of what I thought. But once I finally did start it I totally bought into it! The initial set up was a little off putting but after that I found myself seeking it out every spare minute I had and was even late to work a day or two because I got caught up in the story and lost track of time.

THIS NEVER HAPPENS TO ME!!! I'm not a plot-driven reader. It occurred to me that I might be suckered in by the whole son seeking his mom drama but it wasn't just that. I actually liked the action scenes as well.

and of course it was a bonus to be able to genuinely share my son's enthusiasm. To say ""I knew it was _____!, when did you realize it was _____? I knew it when he started falling in the pit."" etc, etc,etc.

So 5 stars just because my enjoyment took me so off guard."
639,640,5,"Updated:

I loved The Lightning Thief just as much the second time around. I'm so glad it held up to my memories of it. My favorite scenes are still the sequence at the Arch, the Lotus Hotel and Casino, and the Underworld. I can't wait to see the upcoming Disney+ series!

follows Percy Jackson, a demigod, on a quest of self-discovery and an edge-of-your-seat magical adventure that asks what if all those ancient Greek legends and myths were real and active in today’s world. Throughout the novel so many fantastic things happen, but the characters, although fantastical themselves to a certain point keep the reader engaged. The characters are well developed and grow in the course of the story. In the story Percy can hardly believe what is happening, which also mirrors the reaction of the reader helping to make the story engaging as the reader discovers along with Percy. For young readers, I believe it would be good to have a program relating to the ancient Greece myths and legends expanding upon the knowledge base in order to make the reading experience more fulfilling."
640,641,5,"I still love this series too. No matter how many times I read it I still love Percy. He is so funny. I just feel bad for his mother. I can't imagine having to live with someone like Gabe. It's amazing what a mother will do for her kid.

One of the things I love most about this series is that it's fast paced. I love when things just take off. You don't get bored and it keeps you very interested. I wish more books were like this.

The other thing I like about this is the friendship between Percy, Grover, and Annabeth. Although, I will admit that I didn't care much for Annabeth at first. Thankfully she got better once you get to know more about her story. i seem to always forget that she comes across rude at first. That's another perk of re-reading books you get to learn stuff all over again.

I'm definitely looking forward to reading the rest of the series over again. I know that it will be just as good as this one. At least I think it will be...lol."
641,642,5,"The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan is the beginning of his best selling Percy Jackson series, which remains my favorite Riordan set. Twelve year old Percy is just trying to survive his sixth grade year without getting kicked out of school and without failing despite his ADHD and dyslexia. Then his math teacher sprouts wings and claws and tries to kill him on a school trip. His best friend turns out to be a satyr, and the minotaur chases them to the Greek demigod camp at Half Blood Hill and his mom disappears in a flash of light. Within days Percy is claimed as a child of Poseidon and sent on a quest to find and return Zeus' master bolt before war erupts between the gods. With monsters at every turn, Percy and his friends Grover and Annabeth travel west to the Underworld in hopes that Hades is in possession of the bolt only to find that the situation is far more complex than it seems.

Fantastic series. 5 stars."
642,643,5,"So... I have a totally messed up and weird theory.

WHAT IF... the whole demi-god stuff is REAL?
You know how once demi-gods realize that they're a demi-god, their smell becomes stronger right?
Well, what if Rick Riordan is actually a monster of some sort? He writes these books, so young demi-gods read them. The kids then believe that they're a demi-god themselves. I'm sure many of you thought that for a while right? BUT, since they're actually a demi-god, they're smell becomes stronger and monsters attack them? Then they might die... then its just one less demi-god to deal with later. ;-;
Maybe its some evil plan of his?!? :O





Just kidding. I honestly doubt that this is true. I just thought of it as I was going to bed last night. Thought it was funny so I decided to make it my review. So yeah, please no hate or anything ;-; I actually love all of Rick's books. They're wonderfully written and just down right AMZING!!!!"

- A super fun adventure story. The story was well-organized and had a great arc of mystery and action.
- The combination of Grover-Percy-Annabeth was well-balanced. I love that Grover adds humor to story and the banter between Percy and Annabeth is definitely pre-crush.
- The multiple betrayals leaves the reader wondering what will happen next. Just when you thought you had it solved, another happened.
- I really like the idea of Camp Half-Blood. So many activities that I would never have thought of.

- The trio is reminiscent of HP."
644,645,5,"I absolutely loved this book and I'm looking forward to read the next ones. And why does the movie even exist? It's horrible, it has nothing to do with amazing book. I fell in love with the characters, and I can't believe they're only twelve-years-old! I was really sad while I was reading the ending, I was hoping they would stay! But they didn't, oh well. It makes me happy that now Percy can share some time with his mother tho. I think my favorite part was when we finally discovered who is Percy's father (I already knew because of the movie but it was still exciting), it was such an amazing scene!!! My favorite right now is Percy, he's so clumsy and weird and I love him. I also loved Ares' scenes a lot.
Well, I loved it (so so much) and I think this series are gonna become one of my favorite ones."
645,646,5,"I LOVE RAIN !!!
MY FRIENDS THINK ITS A GIRLY THING....

I THINK MY FRIENDS ARE IDIOTS AND LOVING RAIN IS AN UNISEX THING :)

MY LOVE FOR READING COMES SECOND TO MY LOVE FOR READING IN A RAINY DAY !!! so when it started raining as I was about to resume reading this book from where I left last night,the first thing I did was take a big piece of paper and wrote on it ,and stick it on the door to my room.so for the rest of the time it was me ,the rain,the rain in the book,the sea,the sea in the book and a beautiful story by Rick Riordan . I couldn't have asked for more . I absolutely loved the book .NO OTHER BOOK UNTIL I COMPLETE THIS SERIES !!! but right now ""BLAA HA-HA FOOD"""
646,647,5,"“My name is Percy Jackson. I'm twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy, a private school for troubled kids in upstate New York. Am I a troubled kid? Yeah. You could say that.”

first read:
this book is my perfection, i love it so much, the warmth and joy this series brings me is unimaginable and I can't wait to re-read it again and again.

typically you see the first books being the weakest in a series, but PJO breaks off from that stereotype, i felt that this book was incredibly strong. with all the characters and their dynamics feeling meaningful and so well described that you could fully immerse yourself into the story.

the mysteries and betrayals along the way that genuinely surprised me sometimes was so fun."
647,648,5,"Yeah!!

Porfin he leído algo de Rick Riordan, sí!
Tenía muchísimas ganas de leer algo de este autor, y que mejor que empezar con Percy Jackson.
Cogí este libro con muchas ganas y la verdad es que no puedo decir que me ha decepcionado. A parte de que me he adentrado en el mundo Percy Jackson del que mucha gente hablaba, he podido aprender MUCHO sobre la mitología Griega, que era uno de los propósitos por los que decidí leer este libro.

El giro del final no me lo esperaba, nunca habría pensado que quien robó el rayo fuera a ser un personaje, que al menos a mi, me cayo bien des de el primer momento. Giro inesperado ppl.

Tengo muchas ganas de leerme el segundo libro y bueno, la saga completa. Pero de momento solo puedo decir que me ha gustado mucho. :)"
648,649,5,"If I had a nickel for every time I finished a Percy Jackson book in a day in the Year of Our Lord 2023, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. This book is like sitting in front of a warm fireplace and watching your favorite tv show, it's just the best feeling ever. Unlike other old favorites that I've read in the past (Carry On 3) this book 100% is just as good as I remembered it. The jokes still make me laugh 10 years later, the plot is still fun and exciting to read, the plot twist is really well done, and Percy is still my favorite character to ever be written into existence, I would do anything for this son of a gun. This wild dude. And reading it now with the casting in mind???? I just know that Walker is going to be an amazing Percy."

I really pity the person who has a Gabe statue in their home *shudders*

650,651,5,"I have put off reading these books for YEARS. Because I hated them. More specifically, I hated that no one read anything BUT Percy Jackson.

Turns out there's a reason for the hype because it's so totally fun. Greek myths and I have a rough past, but I was never freaked out here, just excited about all the references I was understanding. The tone is so unique because it doesn't take itself too seriously? But the stakes still feel genuinely hard yet possible? I absolutely believed that the characters were kids without being whiny.

I can't believe I made it so many years without spoilers, but as soon as I started reading I got a big one. Still, I think I would've figured it out myself eventually.

5 stars because there was never a dull moment and I cared about Percy from page 1."
651,652,5,"2023 reread: Honestly, I love this book so much and I can't explain how much this series means to me. Yes, Harry Potter got me into reading, but Percy Jackson made me stay, and I'll forever be thankful for that. If I ever meet Rick Riordan I will cry and exclaim how much he means to me...or just stay quiet and point like an idiot...the only two options.

This was a great reread.
The audiobook is great, even though I believe one actor did all the voices. I like full-cast audiobooks, but I believe that this voice actor did a great job with the different voices.
Anyways...totally love this reread of the series, and I can't wait to reread the rest."
652,653,5,"This is the start of an amazing journey🥲✨
Percy is a witty and brave character. I love him. Throughout the book he was so good especially when making jokes about Greek gods or confusing Greek names with other words😂💔
Annabeth... she is so awesome. Always has a plan, so smart. The arguing about Athena and Poseidon was so good. Also she acted brave with Cerberus (I have a feeling she thinks of Cerberus as her pet)
Grover was also good and brave. We will see more of him in the next book (maybe not more but has a more important part)
The adventures were also good
My favorite chapter was fighting with Auntie M
The audiobook was so awesome! I loved the narrator and the way he read it"
653,654,5,"When I started to read the book, I was comparing it unconsciously with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J. K. Rowling. Then, this book made me forget to compare the two books.

This book is totally awesome in it's own way.

Yes, there are some similarities between Percy and Harry, such as, both of them have been ignorant of their magical heritage and powers, both of them have been ignorant of their fame and the enormous responsibilities they have to carry out. But, Rick Riordan has managed to incorporate the Greek mythologies with reality wonderfully."
654,655,5,"I rated this 4 stars years ago and now, rereading it for like the seventh time, I'm changing it to 5. This is the book that started it all, that laid the foundations for my favorite fantasy series. And it has it all. In this first quest they go through so many different encounters that this is an easy page-turner. The twist is no longer a twist for me, but I remember not expecting it at all and being really taken by surprise. These are 5 stars awarded with a lot of nostalgia, but there's no denying The Lightning Thief set the stage for an amazing age of heroes."
655,656,5,"This book had me at the edge of my seat! I couldn't put it down! I don't really know what to say about this book. I had a TON of people recommend this book to me, and i'm glad they did. I also have to be honest, I wasn't expecting the sarcasm and tons of background emotions. I'm also happy that I didn't expect them, so they flew me off track (in a good way) :) so I could get back on track with a
slow-dying laughter and a HUGE smile on my face.

My rating:
5 stars

Why?:
It surprised me. I wasn't expecting the jump out, but when it came I was delighted!"

At first I didn't wanna read it because it was middle-grade but after I read Harry Potter and it turned into my all time favourite I decided to give a chance to this series and I'm so glad I did.This book was amazing.The writing is so good and I loved the humor and the irony.Percy,Grover and Annabeth were a great team and I loved to read about their adventures.I can't wait to read the rest books of the series."
657,658,5,"this book was amazing, it's a fast-paced, action packed epic story filled with awesome characters.

I love Annabeth, she's all ready in my top three favourite female characters of all time. (along with Ginny weasly and Clary fray.) this isn't much of a spoiler but I thought that Annabeth was going to be the friend that betrayed Percy.

overall everything in this book was A+ from the writing style to the chapter names."
658,659,5,"This book was absolutely stunning. A page turner for me , I was a bit confused at first .. had to restart it but once the action started it was fast pace and hard to put down , it was beautifully written and a amazing piece of children Literature ,I didn’t get to read it as a child but now it was the time and I absolutely loved it . Books don’t have a age range at least to me . This is fantastic and I didn’t want it to end ."

I find Sally's reason for marrying Gabe incredibly stupid and her blatant murder of him seems out of character and has never sat well with me."
661,662,5,"Já perdi as contas de quantas vezes li essa história, mas nunca perde a graça. Percy Jackson é uma parte de mim que me orgulho muito, então essa leitura foi duas vezes mais especial porque o meu namorado leu comigo e adorou.

The second time however, I love it."
663,664,5,"My favorite middle-grade series.

Qué bonito inicio de saga.

Tenemos a Percy Jackson, un niño de 12 años que, tras la muerte de su madre, vive una serie de situaciones extrañas que lo llevan a darse cuenta que es un mestizo, es decir, el hijo de un dios y una humana. Ante dicho descubrimiento hace nuevos amigos: Annabeth y Grover, quien en este mundo son: la hija de Atenea y un sátiro. Juntos se embarcarán en la aventura de descubrir quién ha robado el rayo de Zeus, pues es un objeto poderoso y en manos equivocadas podría crear el caos y porque es parte de una mítica profecía que eventualmente convertirá al protagonista en héroe.

Esta primera parte de la saga tiene partes buenas y malas, pero pesan más las primeras porque la verdad disfruté bastante la historia. Tiene capítulos medianamente cortos y cuentan con un ritmo que no disminuye, de verdad llega a enganchar bastante y se lee muy rápido. Fue toda una sorpresa para mí porque para el momento en el que salió, ganó bastante popularidad, pero a mí no me llamaba la atención porque el tema de la mitología me aburre, pero…. Fue este año, gracias al Club de Lectura «Memento Mori» que me atreví a darle una oportunidad y me gustó más de lo imaginado. Sumarle a ello que los personajes están bien construidos, los amas o los odias, no hay punto medio. El worldbuilding y todas las criaturas que abundan, añadiendo que le da cierto toque de fantasía urbana. Todo es precioso y muy bien hilado.

¿Puntos negativos? Algunas escenas fueron tan ridículas y que mostraron a Percy en una faceta de niño tonto que me hacían pensar: ¿qué carajos estoy leyendo? Por otro lado, la actitud de Percy ante la muerte de la mamá, básicamente el luto le duró un par de horas, se sintió como: ok, me dolió, pero soy el héroe de esta historia y debo mostrarme fuerte. WTF? Fue demasiado forzado. Además, la descripción de algunos dioses se sintió como cátedra de escuela o definición de enciclopedia que me desesperaba. Pero a grandes rasgos, como dije anteriormente, pesan más las buenas razones que las malas.

El final es bastante correcto, da paso a un siguiente libro, pero no es un final tan abrupto; si bien deja un par de pistas para lo que vendrá, no resulta metido a la fuerza. Muy bonito.

Si bien me encantó, más adelante retomaré la saga, en octubre fue mi mes de leer sagas y noviembre es de libros autoconclusivos. Me decidí a leer este libro porque me pareció llamativa la idea de leerlo en conjunto, pero ya será hasta el próximo año que le dé continuidad a los demás libros."
693,694,5,"*No spoilers except things that you'll figure out in the beginning when you start reading*
I usually post an in-depth explanation of the book in my review, but I don't think this book needs one. I rated it five stars, not because it's an extremely great book, *It's not REALLY good, but it's amazing!* but because it's such a classic I cannot rate it any lower! It was one of the first books I've ever read a few years ago, and it got me into the reading world and I love it for that.

Actually, I guess I'll get into the three main characters just a bit...

is a really good main character I think, and he's just... good you know? Honestly don't know what else to say... I shouldn't have gotten myself into this mess, why do I always do this? Anyways, he has courage, and when he shows up in the other books in other series's, he seems like a better character to me honestly, I don't know why.

is the standard girl in the story, and I love that she's smart and a daughter of Athena. I love how Percy relies on her because of her smarts and no offence... when he's not in battle, Percy's not that smart. "")

Let me ask this once, and once only. WHY IS GROVER NEVER THE MAIN CHARACTER? In 'The Heroes Of Olympus', Annabeth get's her book in which she's the main character, but Grover get's nothing. Let me tell you, I love Grover. I think he's a great addition, and he's just amazing. I love that he's a satyr and he's such a coward, but extremely brave at the same time.

All I have to say is that I love this series because it's so sentimental and special, it has done good in this world for many people."
694,695,5,"Lo ame, quien diga que este libro es solo para niños esta en una gran mentira. Este libro creo que definitivamente sirve para cualquiera. Es una de las historias más entrañables que he leído este año, el suspenso que forma la trama es asombroso para ser un libro de fantasía y la forma en cómo Rick Riordan explica cada situación de la mitología griega en la actualidad es asombroso, de verdad me quede sorprendida con su ingenio e imaginación. Aparte todo lo que Percy junto con Annabeth y Grover tuvieron que pasar para cumplir con su misión y para sobrevivir fue asombroso e incluso sumerge al lector en miles de sentimientos y llegas a sentir miedo por ellos y también como angustia por esos niños que tienen que enfrentarse de cara contra la muerte ¡una y otra vez! Simplemente ame el libro y estoy segura de que no voy a esperar mucho para empezar el segundo. Hablando de si es fácil o no de leer en inglés, pues le dire que ¡es súper sencillo! Creo que tiene un nivel entre básico e intermedio, si nunca has leído en inglés te recomiendo primero leer algo contemporáneo con lo cual familiarizarte y después no le veo problema a leer estos libros, no lo sientes pesado, ni complicado y en realidad solo busque unas cuantas palabras de mitología para ubicarme, así que súper recomendado para empezar a leer en inglés.

5/ 5 estrellas ⭐️"
695,696,5,"não sei nem como descrever esse livro... meus deuses do céu! relutei muitos anos para ler a série e finalmente resolvi dar uma chance... estou MUITO surpresa positivamente com a narrativa, a forma como a mitologia é explicada, a relação (a linha tênue) entre o mundo mortal e o dos semi-deuses/deuses, o quentinho no coração, a sensação de fazer parte da história e dos personagens... é surreal :’)

[aqui possui alguns poucos spoilers]

ele consegue fazer tudo o que eu não esperava, acho muito interessante como a jornada de percy é cheia de aventuras (locais de diversões de crianças normais como parques aquáticos, museus, cassinos, e etc) transformadas pela magia, mostrando que ele é um garoto aparentemente com características normais porém muito maior, mais poderoso do que julgam. a criança problemática, o semi-deus, o herói do olimpo... outra coisa interessante é como o autor consegue trazer assuntos pertinentes em uma fantasia como essa, como personagens com cleptomania, tdah, mas também, situações com temáticas como alienação (a cena do cassino), pais problemáticos, coragem e etc... porque toda o livro com um caráter psicológico maior, aproximando o leitor ainda mais!

me identifiquei com eles e quis fazer mais parte ainda de tudo isso, afinal o impacto é grande demais e como o próprio poseídon disse: o mar não gosta de ser contido."

I love the humor in Riordan books, I don't think I've ever read anything else like it. I liked Percy, it was easy to forget he was 12 (which probably would have driven me a little crazy), he did seem to act a little older most of the time which I liked. I loved the way the Gods played into this story, especially the big three. It was such a cool world. Annabeth and Grover were awesome side characters, they were perfect for Percy's character. I will read the next one of these soon for sure."
699,700,5,"Did I read this book freakin’ slow? Yes, yes I did.
But let’s not talk about how slow read I am.

This book was just amazing! I already love these books so much!

— Annabeth is such a baddie and I love her already!
— Percy is a great main character, cool sarcastic dark-haired boy, we all love them, right?
— This whole book was just so interesting and there wasn’t even one boring page
— I’m already reading second book and can’t wait to finish all of them💗"

Lo he disfrutado muchísimo, y no dudaré en seguir leyendo."
702,703,5,I never read these books when I was younger and they were first coming out. With a new book coming out this year I decided to read the whole slew of the author's interconnected books.

I am so mad that I haven’t read this book sooner. It was the perfect story to get me out of my funk. Its classified as a middle school grade level book, but assure you everyone can enjoy reading it because it’s just an easy going adventure story with Greek gods, heroes and monsters. Anyone would enjoy that. I will for sure read the rest of the series as well."
706,707,5,"Yeah this shit fucked fr. As good as I remember from reading it as a kid. The relationships between the homies building over the book is so good, from their subtle interactions to the bigger things.

729,730,5,"I was entertained the entire time honestly. It’s getting 5 stars cause I read it in one day. I liked the part where Rick Riordan made it cannon that Thomas Jefferson judges people in the underworld.

734,735,5,"“My name is Percy Jackson.
I’m twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy, a private school for troubled kids in upstate New York. Am I a troubled kid?
Yeah. You could say that.”

I’m sure we all have that book on our to-be-read lists, a book that you constantly stare at thinking, “I really need to read you,” but the timing is just not right. The Lightning Thief is that book for me. I think this novel has been on my TBR list longer than any other and I finally forced myself to read it after finding it at my local library. On a whim, I borrowed it and fell in love with the incredible world and characters Rick Riordan has created.

I’m sure almost everyone is familiar with the story, but if you aren’t, the book follows 12-year-old Percy Jackson, an ADHD and dyslexic boy who is constantly kicked out of school due to regular mishaps and bad behaviour. On a class excursion at his newest school, Percy is attacked by a teacher who turns into a horrible monster and he discovers a truth about himself: he is a demi-god, half-human half-god, and the son of the sea god Poseidon. The Greek gods are alive and real and living in New York City. Percy is taken to Camp Half-Blood where he meets more of his kind, including Annabeth, the daughter of Athena, and Grover, a satyr. Not too long after he arrives, Percy discovers that he has angered the gods, especially Zeus, who believes that Percy has stolen his lightning bolt. Percy, Annabeth and Grover are sent on a quest to find the bolt, as well as Percy’s mother who was kidnapped, and the mysterious lightning thief.

Perhaps I read this novel at the right time in my life or maybe it was just that good, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was entertained from the first page, right until the very end. I am completely enchanted by the world Riordan has effortlessly created. It is such an amazing concept. I’ll admit, I was a little sceptical that the gods would simply just be there with no explanation aside from, “Yeah, they’re still alive,” but that was not the case. Riordan eloquently described how the ancient Greek gods are still kicking it. The gods, as well as Olympus and anything else attached to their realm, had followed the natural progression of Western Civilisation, becoming the central deities of whichever country or Empire happened to be in charge at the time. They started (obviously) in Greece, moved to Rome where the Romans deigned them with different names; then to Western Europe and the Renaissance, kept alive through the rebirth of classical literature and artwork. Today, the gods have settled in the current most powerful country in the world: America. Olympus can be found on the 600th floor of the Empire State Building and the entrance to the Underworld is in L.A.

The world-building is amazingly complex, detailed and well thought out. Everything makes perfect sense as Riordan divulges certain pieces of information and history into the text at precise moments. Riordan’s writing was a little elementary and simple, but considering his protagonist is 12 years old and the novel is middle grade fiction, that’s understandable. The writing matched the tone of the novel – fun, witty and comical.

I found the story-line engaging and I would frantically flip the pages, so excited and intrigued to discover the truth and what will happen next. I loved the inclusion of so many of my favourite characters from Greek history and mythology. Each time a new, recognisable character was introduced, I practically squealed in excitement.

The Lightning Thief was a delightful series-starter that left me wanting more. This novel was so fun and entertaining it was impossible to put down.

735,736,5,"La verdad agradezco mucho no haber leído nunca los libros cuando era adolescente porque descubrir las historias en mi vida adulta ha sido una tacita de chocolate para el alma. Percy es un narrador gracioso que intenta salir adelante a pesar de todos los percances que ha tenido en su vida, me gusta que su mamá no es tratada como un estorbo para ser héroe, siempre he sido muy fan de la idea de los dioses aprendiendo a convivir en el mundo moderno y toda la historia de Ares y la televisión humillante de Hefesto es un concepto brillante. También me gustó que se preocupan mucho por el medioambiente contaminado y cómo eso afecta la conexión sagrada con los dioses.

Y Hades en cualquier libro es buen personaje."
736,737,5,"4.5
Sigo procesando el último capítulo que leí, pero he de decir que como mi primer libro en inglés fue este le voy a tener mucho valor sentimental, en fin Percy en el primer momento fue un personaje que me cautivó y me hizo quererlo por su forma de ser, del ayudar a todos a los que lo necesitara. También ame el trío de Grover, Annabeth y Percy es que los amo tanto como se protegen entre sí y buscan soluciones entre los tres en cualquier situación, también Rick te hace empatizar con ellos de una forma que logras encariñarte con todos y me encanto.

También el plot twist del final, es que no logré captar en qué momento pasó todo eso.
Cuando Percy hablo con Poseidon no pude resistirme y llore porque a pesar de todo él siempre cuidó y lo observo diciendo al final que era digno de ser el hijo de un Dios.

Este libro de verdad lo disfruté mucho y espero que en algún momento pueda releerlo y disfrutarlo como la primera vez."

Why did it take me so long to read a Rick Riordan book???

739,740,5,"“[…] If you recognize yourself in these pages - if you feel something stirring inside - stop reading immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it’s only a matter of time before they sense it too, and they’ll come for you.
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”- R. Riordan, “Percy Jackson and the lightning thief”

“Percy Jackson and the lightning thief” is often perceived as a regular, full-of-nonsensical-adventures book dedicated to younger readers. Nevertheless, I can’t agree with this unjust statement.

We meet the main character Percy, a 12-year-old boy, who has always been different from the other kids. He notoriously caused problems at school and did poorly at studying. He always ended up being expelled halfway through the year.

Everything changes when he finds out that he’s a demigod. Suddenly, all of the features he thought were a sign of being abnormal turned out to be his greatest strengths. I admire how Riordan makes a remarkable tribute to the ADHD kids, presenting it as something magnificent, not a defect. It’s a creative, consistent idea that is simultaneously natural and unforced; it is honestly logical. The brilliance of presenting the restless nature of kids suffering from ADHD as battle instincts, or the dyslexia being the result of their brain programmed to read ancient Greek, is something that makes the book very inclusive; Riordan reaches out to the children that struggle with themselves.

Percy isn’t a dull, flat character. He’s loyal and brave, but in a way that doesn’t seem sublime. He has doubts, worries, and insecurities, but at the end of the day, he’s a natural leader, immersed in this world, not dragged through his own story. He’s a genuine, lovable protagonist. He's half-god, half-boy, and all hero.
The other characters are also worth attention. Annabeth - a clever, charming girl, that has always wanted to be offered a quest so she can prove herself; Grover - a small Satyr with the biggest heart, believing in things that were forgotten by the others. They were astonishing friends and great companions. They have stolen my heart since the first pages.

Riordan didn’t disappoint me with the creative use of greek mythology. It’s interwoven in the plot, making it absorbing, but also explaining many aspects of our everyday life, which was exactly why the myths were born. In this case, Riordan brings them to contemporary standards - for instance, Hades Helm’s aura of deadly terror is described to be the reason why most rational beings fear the dark.
At this point, Rick Riordan is educating us about Greek mythology through the whole book without the audience realising! I think it’s the convenient quality of this book. The mythology is wrapped in a layer of American culture and decent humor, so the book is undemanding and diverting to read.

The (typical for Greek mythology) anthropomorphization of the gods serves, inter alia, the function of showing the rife bitterness of the parent-child relationship. We can interpret the god parent as a symbol of a parent completely disregarding their child, at best sending them a postcard once a year. All of the campers are trying hard to prove something to their parents, either by extravagance or by their expertise.

The plot is very engaging from the start and appealing to the ones that have ever felt they didn’t belong. As the series goes along, it becomes even more inclusive. I reckon it might be one of the reasons why Riordan’s books are successful - everybody can find a piece of themselves while reading. That’s how I felt. I think everyone should read this book - it’s entertaining, but also contains some qualities all people should be familiar with."
740,741,5,"This book is so amazing.
Like damn it has so much Harry Potter vibe i like it.
I really love mitology i didnt even know cant wait to read every book of series!"
741,742,5,why didn’t i read this fucking series earlier ahhh love it so much
742,743,5,"Book Grade: A
I already know what your’e thinking, ‘Is she only just reading this now?’. Maybe…well ok yes, but that doesn’t mean I loved this book any less.
This book was truly outstanding!!! I fell in love with the story from the first chapter. Going in to this book I didn’t know what to expect. In fact I only picked up this series because of my best friends persistent and pushy attitude (literally I think it adds up to around 4 years of nagging). Now it may have also been my stubborn attitude that told me that no one can boss me around and get me to do anything until I want to do it. Luckily for me the box set went on sale and I thought I may as well see what all the fuss was about, given the hype that still surrounds the series and spin off series today.
I thought that Percy being 12 might make him less relatable as a character and boy was I wrong. The amount of attitude and sass that Percy has makes him such a relatable character and a absolute joy to read. The age had absolutely no effect on how I read this book.
Now I don’t know if I was so wrapped up in the story that I ignored some of the signs but from the get go I thought that Percy would have been Zeus’s son, after you started paying attention to the involvement with water it became a little more obvious that he was in fact Poseidon’s son. I must also say that I love how the sea element was entwined within the story.
I found that the that the story was laid out and the constant symbolism of the Gods was amazingly written, an I cannot commend Rick Riordan enough on his work. I loved how each cabin at Camp Half-Blood represented a different God and used the elements of each god to create distinct cabins. I also like how this slightly separated the campers and how Riordan was able to create distinctions between members of the camp. I also enjoyed reading about the different places of the Gods and how they changed forms. From Ares human motorbike form to Zeus and Poseidon at the summer solstice. I loved how the descriptions were easy to imagine and weren’t the stereotypical Hollywood style gods with glitter and fluffy locks.
This characters in this book were just so easy to love from Annabeth’s strong willed mind and sharp, strategic game plans to Grover’s big dreams and loyal heart. I love how the trio (Percy, Annabeth, Grover) faced every challenge throughout the quest and never left a man/ woman behind. They showed just how strong friendship and how easily it can be broken (Luke). Just saying I always had an unsettling feeling regarding Luke and now I know why. I wasn’t so much shocked because I had been anticipating that Luke would be the one that wasn’t really Percy’s friend but I still felt the pang of a deception that Luke made me feel because of his betrayal.
I can’t wait to see how this story turns out and am looking forward so much to reading the rest of the books in this series and the spin off series as well. I feel like even though this is supposed to be a children’s book it is something I have enjoyed as a teenager and will continue to enjoy through adulthood. I can’t believe I shyed away from this series for so long but am so glad I finally picked it up.

MEG'S RATING: *****

MEG'S REVIEW: I loved this book! Witty and exciting. Perfect for mid- to late-elementary kids who need something fun and (shhh... don't tell them) educational. I read my kids a picture book about the Greek gods/monsters first, and I would definitely recommend doing that. Half the fun of the series is trying to pick up clues to determine which famous Greek-myth character Percy's just met. I loved the movie as well, but they are, at best, vaguely related in both tone and audience. READ THE BOOK FIRST! In making the inevitable ""Big HP Comparison""--I found it funnier and faster-paced than our friend Harry, just not as deep or relevant.

MEG'S FAVORITE QUOTES:

Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.

The guy reeked like moldy garlic pizza wrapped in gym shorts.

He looked like a cherub who'd turned middle-aged in a trailer park.

I didn't understand how. But the toilets had responded to me. I had become one with the plumbing.

Foot racing? No good either. The wood-nymph instructors left me in the dust. They told me not to worry about it. They'd had centuries of practice running away from lovesick gods. But still, it was a little humiliating to be slower than a tree.

""That really was NOT fun, though. Well, the hitting-her-with-a-stick part, that was fun. But crashing into a concrete bear? NOT fun."" (Grover)

(Description of hell) Even from far away, I could see people being chased by hellhounds, burned at the stake, forced to run naked through cactus patches or listen to opera music.

What horrible things would you have to do in your life to get woven into Hades's underwear?

Look again, my brain said. We're looking, my eyes insisted. It's really there.

""If you intend to stay at Camp Half-Blood year round, you must inform the Big House by noon today. If you do not announce your intentions, we will assume you have vacated your cabin or died a horrible death. Cleaning harpies will begin work at sundown. They will be authorized to eat any unregistered campers. All personal articles left behind will be incinerated in the lava pit."" (Mr. D's camp note)"

2018 Re-Read Review (SPOILER FREE!!) :

I have honestly went through such another magical time re-reading this book. I was brought back to a time when i was in the fourth grade, sitting in that small wooden desk, and getting lost in the world of Percy Jackson and his wonderful adventures.

And now, nearly sixteen years old and knowing of the events of this entire series plus Heroes of Olympus, I can definetly say I fell in love with Percy 1000x more.

I luckily got to share this magic with my little brother, and I was so happy to see that he shipped Percabeth (major YESSS!) and came to love the characters and stories as much as I did as a kid.

What I love about Percy and his stories is that not only do we caught up in this beautiful mythical world of magic and monsters, but all the same, Percy is still growing up. He's relatable and human and emotional all the same, and I love him for every flaw and imperfection.

Annabeth reminds me highly of myself every time I read about her (This being like the 2827277th time) and her wiseness and logic shines through with every little situation. She's a gorgeous blonde with a mean left fist, and a brain full of facts and wiseness, how the hell can someone not love her?

Grover has taught me of kindness and bravery. He's one of my brother's by far , and Grover is as loving and funny as I remember him to be as a child.

I will be continuing with this re-read of this series throughout the summer for sure!

APRIL RE-READ, SPRING OF 2019 (SPOILER FREE)

After going through another torturous book slump, I turned to my shelf and instantly picked up the first book that came to mind, my good old buddy (he and I go wayyyy back): The Lightning Thief.

Each year, I try to re-read Percy Jackson plus the Heroes of Olympus, as a remainder that this is the series that started my love for reading at only nine years old.

Seven years and multiple re-reads later, I have come to love Percy and his demi-god friends unconditionally once again, loving them a little more than the last time again.

This being my a millionth re-read, you'd expect me to remember every single last detail of the story, but each time, I cross paths with an event in the book that has been hidden away in my memory, and I find myself smiling with sentiment.

For parents that kids (or sibilings that have sisters and brothers) who don't like to read, get them to start off with Percy Jackson. Percy Jackson is an adventurous tale of growing up alongside friends and even family, all the while slaying the baddies and winning at the end of the day. And in the mix of this killer tale, they even learn some greek mythology and Latin on the way.

A definite 10/10!"
745,746,5,"Homework or fighting monsters? Tough choice…

Rick Riordan has produced something so exceptional and astonishingly outstanding, that it completely blew me away by its originality and flair. Like nothing I have encountered before I simply love how the author cleverly combines Greek mythology with modern-day, for a truly inspired outcome. The current, contemporary ‘feel’ to this story not only makes history seem cool but which also makes the past feel relevant and very much a part of the present. If you are a teen who is not a particularly alert person in the history classroom, then I urge you to seek out Percy Jackson and discover how exciting it really is!

“Look I didn’t want to be a half-blood. I never asked to be the son of a Greek God…”

Percy Jackson believes that he is a typical teenager, who also suffers from ADHD and Dyslexia. What Percy doesn’t know is that he is actually a Demigod ~ with a human mother and his father is a Greek God (Poseidon). After coming to terms with this new revelation and his abilities (like reading ancient Greek or having quick reactions when fighting off a Minotaur), Percy is taken to a sanctuary for his kind ~ CAMP HALF-BLOOD.
Zeus has lost a lightning bolt which he believes that Percy has stolen and which Hades of the Underworld is also anxious to get hold of. With Percy’s mother held captive by Hades, he boldly begins on an epic journey with his friends ~ Grover and Annabeth. Percy is tested when he encounters Medusa in her garden of stone statues, when he encounters Hydra’s many heads and when he is lured into a trap by the Lotus. With a lot of courage Percy is able to stand-up to evil and shows that true heroism is not without flaws.

Exciting and action-packed this thrilling tale is filled with magic, mystery and a lot of death defying danger. This vastly entertaining read was so intensely gripping I was unable to put the book down for even a moment, as I was sucked into this story like I had plunged into a magical portal ~ transported into the fascinating world of Percy Jackson. This inspired creation of pure genius I predict becoming a timeless classic amongst teenagers and school kids. It is unique for Percy Jackson appeals to both boys and girls equally, as it is an impressive adventure/ action story that is well-written and clever.
Totally unputdownable and addictive this is a book for readers with vivid imaginations, who are looking for something that is fueled by electric tension, scintillating suspense and memorable, fantastic characters.

I simply LOVED it!!

746,747,5,"2018 updated review: https://charmainelimen.wordpress.com/...

I finally got around to reading this series, after having been scolded by two of my friends for not having read this as a child (I haven't read Harry Potter either). So I bought the box-set and started reading it to avoid being ""screamed"" at again.

I had heard nothing but good things about Rick Riordan's writing and the Percy Jackson series. But I didn't really know what to expect, going into this. Of course, I already knew a few things off the bat
. So I opened the book with only the expectation of being entertained. And that I was, very much so.

Percy is perhaps one of the most brilliant characters out there. Maybe not in terms of intelligence
but definitely in terms of personality. The ever pessimistic-yet-somehow-optimistic character of Percy Jackson brought endless laughs and uncontrollable smiles to my face. His style of narration and quick wit made more for an even more entertaining read.

This was a fantastic introduction into the series, with enough world building to explain the premise of this book, but little enough to make you want to read the next book and find out more.

Now, do I go into the plot? Nope. If you haven't read this, I highly suggest that you do. But go into this as blindly as you can. Rick Riordan has a way of revealing things and surprising you, that can only be made better by not knowing exactly what each book entails.

Do I regret not reading this in my childhood? Nope. I doubt I would be able to pronounce half the names in this book (a dictionary WAS required), nor does anyone in my family really know anything about Greek mythology. Also, I think that reading this as a teenager allowed me to appreciate
more than if I had read it as a child.
Also, I'm glad that I didn't have to endure the painful waits between books like many others did. And while I do love the series, I will not ever dare to claim that I grew up with these books, or that my love for the series could ever be on par with that of someone who did grow up with Percy and had to wait for each book to come out."
747,748,5,"You know how everyone always says that if you read a lot as a child, there was a certain YA series that defined your childhood? Hunger Games, Twilight, Harry Potter, etc? Yeah. I think you can see where this is going.

I honestly don't think I'll ever stop thinking about the Percy Jackson books. The rest of the series goes on to really define the Riordanverse, but there's also something so creative and purely enjoyable about the Lightning Thief. I mean, hell, we've got Medusa working as a sculptor making statues for the Underworld, Dionysus working as a camp counselor as his latest Zeus-given punishment, playing fetch with a giant Cerberus. The whole thing just screams which is one of its main appeals.

But also, Rick Riordan does a great job of adapting the experiences of a struggling child into a fun, escapist setting. Percy Jackson is a neurodivergent kid struggling with ADHD and dyslexia, and reading this as a 12-year-old still trying to understand their own ADHD diagnosis, I that. All off the half-bloods have some sort of issue that isn't too far from the experiences of any young child—your parent remarries and you feel out of place in their name family, you have a step-dad that really sucks, you have ADHD and dyslexia but for some reason the teachers can't tell why you're struggling in class and have troubles controlling your impulses. It's not perfect, but as a sixth-grader in 2016 (and, I'm assuming, for kids in 2005 when it's first written), it's enough. It's not overly dramatic, but it's a struggle, which I think is part of what separates it from a lot of other fiction where kids have trouble in school and shitty home lives.

Also, on a more indulgent level, there's also that found family that really makes me go a little insane. Now, as an 18-year-old, watching these 12-year-olds travel cross-country by themselves with only each other while they sleep on trains and bus stations and split little bags of food for each other and make sure the other ones are warm—I'm not gonna lie; it was a little emotional.

Just; I don't know. They're far from perfect, but something about the Percy Jackson books just to the same primal, juvenile part of me as it did in sixth grade. I've read this book three times: once in sixth grade, once out loud to my sister, and once just now while I've been sick in my room. Each time, this book never fails to bring light and enjoyment, which I guess, coming from the stance YA/middle-grade books, is all they really have to do."
748,749,5,"Why haven't I read Percy Jackson before??? It was so good! I would have died for this book when I was 12, and I'm really thankful that it isn't age restricted at all. This book was unexpectedly mature, treats greek mythology superbly, and was really intense and full of action. Am I going to take a personality test to see which goddess or god is my parent? Betcha."
749,750,5,"This is a book I’ve been meaning to read for a long time now. I teach Mythology, and when I tell my students I have not read this book yet I receive a lot of shame. After reading the book, I totally understand why. This book is rife with myth. As someone who knows the myths, I loved seeing all the references about Greek Mythology. I really enjoyed that there are not just the common myths about the Greek gods but there are mentions of lesser known myths that as obvious in pop culture. I really enjoyed this read and will be finishing the series for sure."
750,751,5,we love u percy
751,752,5,"“Why can't you place a blessing like that on us?"" I asked.

""It only works on wild animals.""

""So it would only affect Percy,"" Annabeth reasoned.

I absolutely loved this book. Loved it so much I would run a thousand miles for it. Let's start off by saying this: I am the Percy Jackson x Annabeth Chase x Grover reincarnate... basically. Rick Riordan did a fantastic job at explaining Greek mythology to me. I was never one to be into Greek mythology or the Gods and stuff like that. But now, I want to know more. This book makes me crave adventure.






Oh boy. He's a troublemaker, a dyslexic, a product of ADHD, a procrastinator, & a brave hero. I didn't know I would love him this much, especially since it's only the first book. His story was very compelling to me, and I think that's why I connected with him so much. Poor little baby was so confused in the beginning. When his mom died, I think that's when things started to really pick up for me. And then when we find out he's the son of Poseidon... I'm hooked. I do think Poseidon will come around to liking Percy a lot more. What's not to love?




She is baby, and that is final! Annabeth tried acting so tough and closed off in the beginning, but really she's just a softie who wants to see her dad. When she gave Percy her necklace for good luck... tears, just tears. I think she's going to have a great back story, even if we already know a little bit of it.




POC!! Finally. I enjoyed his character so so much. He made me laugh, literally. I think he was one of the most relatable characters in this story. I hope we get to see more of him, because I already miss him and his funny self.


That is all the characters I'm going to write about for now, but who knows? Maybe I'll come back to this review later on and add some more. All I can say is, I'm ready for the next book. I already have it sitting on my nightstand by my bed, ready to go. Thanks for reading, if you made it this far!"
752,753,5,"""Yeraltı Dünyası'nda bile, herkesin, hatta canavarların bile arada bir özel ilgiye ihtiyacı vardır.""

Eğlenceli ve akıcı bir çocuk kitabı olmasının yanında aynı zamanda çok da naif bir kitaptı Şimşek Hırsızı. Okumadan önce ""Ay Yunan Tanrılarıymış, canavarlarmış bu kitap nasıl çocuk kitabı? Okuyan çocuklar korkmaz mı?"" diye düşünerek bir gaflete düşmüş olabilirim ama kitabı okudukça hata yaptığımı anladım. Öncelikle canavarlar ve tanrılar çok basite indirgenmişti. Üç başlı dev köpek Kerberus bile küçük kırmızı bir topla yumuşamıştı. Bu benim pek hoşuma gitmese de olması gereken buydu o yüzden gözardı ettim.

Kitapla ilgili sevdiğim diğer şey ise yaşanan tüm olayların arasına ders verici notlar bırakılmıştı. Kıvırcık karakterinin insanların tüm dünyayı pisletmesinden yakınması. Percy'nin içine girdiği nehir, deniz vesaire gibi yerlerde ambalaj çöplerle karşılaşması hatta kutsal Styks Nehri'nin bile kirlenmiş olması doğaya karşı ne kadar sorumsuz olduğumuza vurgu yapmış.

Hayvanlara eziyet edilen bir bölümde vardı ama spoiler olmaması için ondan bahsetmeyeceğim. (tabi benden başka bu kitabı okumayan kalmışsa :D )

Şimdi gelelim Percy'nin asiliğine, şakalarına, oburluğuna ve küstahlığına. Çok sevdiğim bir arkadaşımda bu özelliklerin hepsi olduğu için Percy ile yıldızımız çabuk barıştı :D Baan sorarsanız herkese Percy gibi bir arkadaş lazım. Arkadaşlarıyla beraber tam bir ""muhteşem üçlü"" oluyorlar. Yapbozun birbirini tamamlayan parçaları gibiler.

Daha fazla yazıyı uzatmak istemiyorum o yüzden; kitabı sevdim ve seriye tabiki de devam edeceğim. Doğan Egmost 300 sayfalık normal kitap boyutlarından daha küçük bir kitaba 25 lira fiyat biçtiğinden ikinci el olarak ilk iki kitabı aldım umarım diğer kitapları da ikinci el temiz bulabilirim :)"
753,754,5,"Till now my firm belief was: Nothing can beat Harry Potter. And I still stand by what I said. I did not expect it to fascinate me more than Harry Potter, but I definitely thought it would be boring...

I was wrong.

The book is so full of mysteries, and unexpected twists and turns. I found many similarities between JKR and Rick Riordan's work, but I guess it's just too early to judge. The plot was catchy and interesting, and gave me a totally different view of Greek Gods and Goddesses. And rather blowing views too, might I add...I mean, you don't expect Ares-The God of War-to ride a bike and have a girlfriend, do you? You don't expect Medusa to have Poseidon as a boyfriend. And it definitely boosted my abnormally low IQ level with different aspects of Greek culture. The prominent of the many similarities I found between Percy Jackson and Harry Potter was that the team of Percy, Annabeth and Grover clashed magnificently with the golden trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione (in case you're wondering, Anvita Ahuja pointed that out to me). They were ready to accompany Percy in his quest, even though they knew that it was Zeus's wrath and the mons-I mean, Kindly Ones' ferocity they were incurring, and their lives would always be in danger from the infernal aspects of the Underworld. And Percy was worried that one of them would betray him, and I will not deny that I was the potential victim of that prejudice, but who did the betrayer turn out to be...?

All in all, it was a wonderful book, and I look forward to starting Sea of Monsters. I have the funny feeling that I'm in for a very enjoyable period of reading!!"
754,755,5,
755,756,5,"My husband and I have been reading this aloud together like we used to with Harry Potter when we first started dating and this honestly blew Sorcerer’s Stone out of the water, especially in terms of the pace. A really fun, creative, and action-packed read. This story was filled with life lessons that would be awesome to hammer home in any school-aged child and rich in references to Greek Lore that would entice any adult reader. Could not recommend enough!





**spoilers and extemporaneous thoughts below**






I loved the explanation of where the Greek gods went, how they differ from God, and how they have traveled with ‘Western civilization’ and can be seen in our symbols and architecture as a reflection of their being in certain places.

So fun and creative

The burnt offerings smelling like happiness

Dramatic pacing that’s so fun and makes me excited in a way I haven’t been since reading Harry Potter

Love the well thought out explanations and modernizations of the classic Greek tropes.

The concept of “I-M’ing” is amazing. Modernized lore so well in a modem that’s already loved by kids.

The idea of the journey to the underworld starting as an elevator (catering to our modern idea of descending into hell) and then evolving into a barge (harkening to the classic Greek myth of crossing the river into the underworld) was so well done!"
756,757,5,"Rick Riordan’s PERCY JACKSON AND THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTING THIEF was delightful. I loved reading about Percy’s travel across the United States, and especially when he reached St. Louis, where I once lived.

I vividly recall my own experience as a child when I also took the elevator to the top of the Arch and especially the ‘floating McDonald’s’ (the fast food restaurant is on a paddle boat if I remember correctly). In fact, the Arch and the McDonald’s boat were always the two mainstay attractions during school field trips when I was an elementary and MG student. Riordan was really able to capture the city and its sites in a way that I could really visualize.

The author did a great job creating this character and crafting this story. Prior to reading the book, I had watched part of the movie, but was turned off by it. Then, when I finished reading the novel, I watched the movie again, but this time watched the movie in full. It’s unfortunate that the film did not do the book justice. If I’m going to be completely honest, then I have to say that Hollywood did a horrible job on it; they nearly rewrote the story. This is a shame because the book is magical.

Riordan made his MC a true hero. In our mortal world, ADHD and dyslexia are considered “problems,” but in the author’s godling world, these are gifts and a natural part of Percy’s demigod existence. What a beautiful way to see the world! This book truly has the power to help kids with both ADHD and dyslexia to see themselves in a different light."
757,758,5,"Relectura (Agosto-2021)
Releyendo toda la saga porque conseguí nuevas ediciones y son hermosas (aparte de unas portadas de Nerdy Ink que son re preciosas).

La historia de Percy la conozco casi al derecho y al revés, e igualmente me sorprende la cantidad de cosas que suceden en esta historia. Casi cada capítulo es un mito o leyenda griega (y me gusta que en los siguientes libros eso mejore y la historia crezca).
Desde el inicio hay que tener claro que es una historia para niños/jóvenes, pero de todos modos es tan entretenida que cualquier persona puede disfrutarla.

Regresar a este mundo, es regresar a un hogar que siempre estará ahí para mí.




----
Nov-2014:

Creo que este es el libro que más he leído en mi vida.

Simplemente lo amo con todo el corazón y es imposible No hacerlo. Una vez escuché que era mejor leer los libros en su idioma original, a menos que este en Ruso, porque nadie entiende Ruso. Así que me digné, una vez leído en español, leerlo en inglés, y fue tal la sorpresa que desde ese momento no me ha interesado en español.
Sus chistes están geniales en inglés y no hay manera de traducirlos al español a menos que le cambien el significado.

Lo recomiendo sin duda alguna, al igual que todos los libros del Tío Rick Riordan.

P.D al parecer soy de los pocos semidioses colombianos que leyó el libro antes de la película. Y eso me hace sentir muy orgulloso.

Hijo de Hefesto."
758,759,5,"Sometimes you've just got to revisit an old favorite, even if you know the twists and turns well enough that you're not shocked by them any more.

Percy Jackson is always going to be a series I hold very dear in my heart, and that has only grown with this re-read. Despite a few minor nitpicks here and there
such as underplaying Medusa's rape (understandable, as this book was written for middle schoolers) or the implications of Hades not being a faithful husband to Persephone (a personal nitpick, and one I'll probably always be heavily biased about) my appreciation for just how many nods to Greek mythology that Uncle Rick managed to pack even just into this first book has grown. Additionally, I think this series and just in general has excellent entertainment value, regardless of the ages of the protagonist and his close friends. The humor is far more clever in most cases than it's given credit for, the power of friendship is a theme we see starting to take root, and the sense of an over-arcing hero's quest to come is what makes this book so much fun and worth reading.

There's little else I have to add that won't dive straight into spoilers or my heavily biased love for these books, so I'll leave it at this: if you haven't read ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians"" yet, you should. You really, really should, if you've considered reading any of the other titles in the Rick Riordan 'verse."
759,760,5,"İ have to admit I read it because of the film. After seeing the film I promised myself to read at least the first book))) Then the second..then the third..and it went like this through 5 books! Actually I can't understand people who says it is for children.. Because it is for everyone who Loves reading, it doesn't have to be only for kids! So,The plot is fast-phased, enjoyable, funny and the book is really page-turner. The characters are gorgeous and real. A little bit character view:
PERCY: OMG, Percy, son of Poseydon, god of sea, is... so funny, clever and cute. He is absolutely beautiful character and real hero of the book! I think Rick Riordan did very well to create Percy like that!
ANABETH: She is daughter of Athena, goddes og wisdom, and clever, brave and absolutely kick-ass female character! I like strong female characters in books and she is one of the best. And she is also best companion for Percy))
Grover: I love Grover's cuteness...He is a really brave satyr in his own way. I appreciate his character and his love for nature))
Clarissa: Maybe people don't like her, but she is brave and strong, even a little bit harsh... But she is daughter of Aries, god of war! So, what is the problem?
And others Who I love))
Pros of this book: Good writing style, good story telling style, characters and plot. Cons; I can not think any bad sides yet)))"
760,761,5,"Este libro es magia pura.

Adoré la forma en que el autor fusiona la mitología griega y el mundo actual, creando una historia juvenil donde no te queda más remedio que disfrutar.

Los personajes son totalmente únicos. Creo que jamás me había encontrado un libro en el que adorara a todos por igual.

Percy es encantador, valiente y divertidísimo. Grover es probablemente el personaje más simpático y leal con el que me he topado en mucho tiempo. Y Annabeth, ¿qué puedo decir de ella? Calculadora, decidida y fuerte. Definitivamente el personaje femenino que todo libro necesita.

La dinámica entre estos tres es encantadora, no puedo esperar a leer más de ellos.

Les aseguro que no podía dejar de leer, todas las aventuras que viven me parecen extraodinarias y fascinantes. El ritmo de la historia es trepidante. Todo el tiempo están sucediendo cosas, lo que nos proporciona una historia con la que no te consigues aburrir en ningún momento.

La forma de escribir de Rick Riordan es sencilla y clara, con unos toques de humor con los que no podrás contener la risa y una originalidad que nos hará creer que todos los dioses pueden existir realmente. 

En definitiva, Percy Jacskon y El Ladrón del Rayo es el comienzo de una saga que nos transporta a un lugar mágico e inigualable. Lo recomiendo en todos los sentidos."
761,762,5,"Leí este libro ayer en la noche. Me gustó mucho. No diría que es una obra maestra, pero fue algo ligero (bueno, para mí) y agradable. Lo disfruté, razón por la que le doy las cinco estrellas. La mitología griega me encanta. Recuerdo que aprendí absolutamente todo lo que pude sobre la mitad de los dioses/titanes/hijos/demás sólo por puro placer, y que este libro les mencionara fue toda una genialidad.

Me encariñé bastante con Percy. Algunas veces me dieron ganas de darle puñetazos amistosos en el hombro (cosa que hice mentalmente con Harry Potter más de la mitad de mi vida xD), lo cual me hizo darme cuenta de que le cogí afecto. Es un protagonista bastante ameno. Y tiene sentido del humor, lo cual me arrancó unas cuantas risas durante la noche.

Como comentario extra, he de decir que este libro tiene una de las PEORES adaptaciones que he visto en mi vida (y he visto muchas). Para empezar, los personajes. Después, el curso de la trama. Hubo un momento en el que no estaba segura de que el libro y la película estuvieran relacionados.OJO: con esto no quiero decir que la película sea mala (a mí me entretuvo, que era el fin con el que la vi), sólo digo que parece todo menos una adaptación.

En fin, léanlo y a ver qué tal les parece."
762,763,5,"Ok so I finished this book in a single day and I loved it! I had been told before that it isn’t gonna be good and stuff but honestly it was awesome! I loved all the cute Percabeth moments and how their friendship was budding ♥️ And oh my god, out of the whole entire freaking book, the ending shook me the most! I HATE LUKE!

Talking about the characters, it was a simply perfect blend of all kinds. From Chiron to the Oracle I think I liked almost everyone. Personally there are some characters that I hate but I like the way they were described, each of their emotions perfectly captured in the pages of this book.

About the plot line, it had everything which makes a book, a book. Thrilling adventures to sweet 12 year old flirting, everything about it was aaaaaaah! I think I may be falling in love with Percy ❤️!

My fav characters: PERCY, ANNABETH, GROVER, Hades( Yes him, cuz he’s a great villain ), Poseidon (even tho he like totally deserted his son), Sally Jackson (greatest mom ever) and list goes on!

I give it 5 stars ⭐️ 🌟 ⭐️ 🌟 ⭐️
And highly recommend that you read it, its awesome! Will be looking forward to read the sequel soon ♥️

Thanks for reading this review!

763,764,5,"Aaaah, es ist mitten in der Nacht und morgen schreibe ich in der zweiten Stunde eine Erörterung in Deutsch ABER ich musste Percy Jackson einfach erst zuende lesen! Es war soo großartig! Ich liiiiiebe es und freue mich jetzt schon wahnsinnig auf die nächsten vier Teile! Irgendwie weiß ich jetzt auch nicht so richtig, was ich jetzt noch sagen soll. Die Welt in der PJ spielt ist einfach grandios gemacht (oder beschrieben, wie auch immer), die Charaktere allesamt super ausgearbeitet und nicht so flach, wie ich es zuletzt oft in anderen Dystopien erlebt habe. Auch wenn das hier eher Urban Fantasy war. Ja, ansonsten fand ich das Buch auch noch suuperlustig :D Grover war einfach genial! Und die bissigen Gespräche zwischen Percy und Annabeth, oooooooooh!! Es hat einfach mal megamega Spaß gemacht, das Buch zu lesen und ich kann es wirklich nur jedem ans Herz legen, der sich ansatzweise dafür interessiert! 4,5 Sterne, weil ich tendenziell nicht so gerne 5 an Auftaktbücher vergebe. Hier hätte ich es fast getan, aber ich glaube, irgendwie/-wo kann sich die Buchreihe noch steigern. Falls das möglich ist :D"
764,765,5,"4.5

Increíble de principio a fin, super entretenido, con acción desde el comienzo, cuando una cosa se resolvía, volvía otra y más problemas para Percy y sus amigos, me encanto que Rick mantuviera esa acción en todo el libro hasta el último capitulo.

Otra cosa que me gusto mucho es ese mundo de Dioses griegos en la época actual super interesante, aunque no se mucho de mitología griega el libro me pareció super interesante . El libro es muy entretenido y muy rápido de leer, cuando me di cuenta ya iba en la mitad. Todo mundo conoce ya esta saga y creo que la estoy leyendo un poco tarde, , y debo decir que me sorprendió bastante, así que no hay mucho que decir.

No le doy las 5 estrellas porque Percy y Annabeth no terminaron de convencerme del todo.




Un excelente inicio de saga y espero mucho leer los siguientes que espero estén como este o incluso mejor."
765,766,5,"Wow! Okay, I really enjoyed reading this. It's fast paced and very interesting as well because it's related to the Greek myths and legends. We all know how twisted and confusing the myths are but thankfully, Rick Riordan made it easy enough to grasp the basic concept and having Percy as confused as the readers might be is a good approach.

I dare say that I enjoyed this more than I do Harry Potter. Some might protest but of course, this is my opinion. I think Percy Jackson has a lot more adventures than Harry Potter does because with Harry, it's all just a series of unfortunate events but with Percy, it's like he was really asking for it, he's more bold than Harry. I like that about people.

{spoilers}
There was this one scene where Percy, Annabeth and Grover were almost killed by the Stretcher (Crusty) on his water-beds, I know Percy isn't the sharpest tool in the box, but there was Annabeth? Daughter of Athena?? Wise girl? Why didn't any of them figure out that Percy could've used the water beds though? I mean, yeah, they're a bunch of scrawny teens but they're half-bloods, and one of them is the daughter of Athena? Hello?"
766,767,5,"Ever since middle school I always had a fascination for Greek mythology. I loved reading the crazy stories the Gods and Heroes got into. I especially loved the mythical creatures. Oh and the deceptions! The betrayals! The love! The dramatics! It is all so fucking interesting! (excuse my language but I am just so hyped lol) I do not know what took me so long to pick up this series, but oh my god I am so glad I finally did.

The Lightning Thief was a wildly entertaining book. I was so immersed in this story. I loved the feeling of nostalgia I got when reading about characters/monsters I studied in school. Everything was meshed perfectly. The author does an excellent job at telling a story. The plot, the characters, the monsters, and everything about this book was executed so freakin' well.

I absolutely loved the way this book ended. I got that oh-I-haven't-seen-nothing-yet-shit-is-about-to-go-down-this-is-only-the-beginning kind of feeling. I can not wait to get started on the next installment right away!

I know this book is middle grade, but I am 23 and I still enjoyed it. Who says adults can't read a middle grade book? *scoffs* *flips hair*"
767,768,5,"I’m having so many emotions right now. Being in camp Halfblood is like coming home to me because I spent a lot of time there when I was younger. When I was in 8th grade I discovered Percy Jackson for the first time and read all 5 books within 2 weeks. They made me feel less alone, understood me when things stopped making sense in the real world. They were my escape and started my love for (greek) mythology 💞

When I first picked up the books again I was scared I wouldn’t love them as much or that I had grown out of them. But it’s quite the opposite! Even though I’m no longer in the “target group” for those books (which is a dumb concept anyway, let’s just read the books we want) they could still capture me from page one. I fell for the characters and the mythology all over again. I love the lightness with which Rick Riordan writes, the jokes, the way he introduces ADHD & dyslexia as part of his characters and makes it strength rather than a weakness (he wrote PJO for his son who had struggled with learning in school just as Percy did). I’ve already written way too much but I am very thankful that those books exist 💞"
768,769,5,"ACTUAL RATING: 4.5 STARS!

Firstly, I'd like to start out that finishing this book has left me feeling so accomplished. Everyone has read Percy Jackson and The Heroes of Olympus and I am one/tenths of the way there! Secondly, I have been in a huge reading slump for a while. Every time I picked up a book, I'd read about 40 pages and then put it down for some reason. The Lightning Thief has brought me out of that slump.

Content wise, I really enjoyed this book. Percy was so funny! The characters were fantastic. The writing was great. The world was amazing. The plot was gripping. For the most part, nothing but praise for this book. I will say that the only reason I docked a half-star was because I had major trouble getting a mental image of Camp Half-Blood, and the Underworld.

I was a little hesitant to pick up this book, because it is classified as middle-grade. I thought I wouldn't like it because I thought the writing wouldn't be that great, but I was so happy to be so wrong. Thank you, Rick Riordan for proving me wrong."

Não tinha criado grandes expetativas para este livro, visto que, vi o filme a alguns anos atrás. (Sim eu sei que não devia ter feito isso.)
Quando começo a ler os primeiros capítulos já fico surpreendida.

Sempre tive imensa curiosidade sobre a mitologia grega e adorei como o autor abordou esse assunto de forma criativa e divertida. Aprendi imenso! Durante o decorrer do livro acontece imensa coisa que nem temos tempo para piscar os olhos e lá está ourtro monstro a atacar. É um livro cheio de emoção e aventura.

772,773,5,"Percy Jackson, a courageous, adventurous, and loyal boy, just realized that he is a demigod, or a child with one parent who is a god and another who is a human. He is quickly rushed to Camp Half-Blood, a camp for others who are demigods just like him. There he meets, an intelligent, strategic, and loyal girl, with whom he becomes close friends. Later that week, Percy assigned a quest, to find Zeus’s lost lightning bolt. He is sent on a journey with mythological monsters, angry gods and huge twists of fate. I loved this book, and I think that anyone who likes tons of action will love it too. It was exciting and suspenseful, so there was never a good time to put down the book. I loved how the author incorporated Greek mythology into the story without just giving information. This book is completely different from the movie, so don’t be discouraged if you thought the movie wasn’t the best. I would recommend this book to everyone who loves action, adventure and an exciting story."
773,774,5,"Este es el momento en el cual debo decir: ¿POR QUÉ ME HE TARDADO TANTO EN LEER ESTE LIBRO? ¡¡¡ES GENIAL!!!
Creo que esa primera línea resume bastante bien mi opinión, en otras palabras puedo decir que el tema de la mitología siempre ha sido de mi agrado y me gusta como Riordan re-versiona algunas cosas para que resulten más interesantes al público juvenil. Por otra parte, las aventuras de Percy y sus amigos, Annabeth y Grover me han recordado mucho a las de otro joven adolescente de la literatura muy conocido, Harry Potter, y a pesar de las diferencias notorias entre una y otra saga, Percy al igual que Harry me ha hecho sentir una joven adolescente de nuevo. Es muy interesante ver, además, como nuestro joven protagonista se arriesga a todo con tal de mostrar lo que puede llegar a ser y lo que es, me gusta mucho la personalidad valiente y leal de Percy. Y debo reconocer que el libro me ha parecido muchísimo mejor que la película. MUY RECOMENDADO!!!"
774,775,5,"Oh the Percy Jackson series. I have heard such good things about you. And some of it is earned. Unlike the much-obsessed over maze runner series (shudders) this series actually has likable characters and a plot line I could follow! I honestly wasn't sure what I would think of this series but I was pleasantly surprised. This first book in the series makes us root for the lovable scamp percy from the very beginning and kept me entertained for the hours it took to read this fun and fast paced book. I genuinely liked all of the characters and found myself looking forward to the next book with anticipation. If not trepidation, worried that it wouldn't be as care free and engaging as this book. Though it's geared towards kids and early teens I think anyone could enjoy this quirky adventure about a boy who discovers he is a god (sort of)

My Booktalk -"
775,776,5,"《My name is Percy Jackson.
I'm twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy, a private school for troubled kids in upstate New York.
Am I a troubled kid?
Yeah. You could say that.》


Ok, tell me WHY I waited so long to read this series.
I mean, this is SO my style. Witty comments, an action-packed story, Olympus gods and whatever ♥
In my defence I should say that I got deceived by other people's comments like ""this is a mess/it's a retarded version of Harry Potter/blah blah blah"". WHAT? Anybody could agree on the fact that the movie sucked [I watched it a month ago while I was in the middle of the book (I wanted to read it before the movie aired on tv but I failed, obviously) and I needed some time to recover from the shock. It was so... Different and boring, duh.], but the books are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Honest, I can't wait to read the next one (in the mean time I'll read another compendium book, just because)."
776,777,5,"QUÉ NOSTALGIA.

Amo esta saga con cada fibra de mi ser. No puedo ser objetiva: es perfecto este libro. Percy, Annabeth, Grover... crecí con estos personajes y volvérmelos a encontrar me hizo muy, muy, muy feliz. Muchos sentimientos, me cayeron lágrimas en cada página. Haber cursado Literatura Griega me ayudó a entender referencias y chistes que antes se me pasaban. Encontré y sentí cosas nuevas, pero también reviví emociones de cuando tenía 12 años. Excelente experiencia, recomiendo redescubrir libros de la infancia.

Gracias a Rick Riordan por presentarle a mi yo niña el mundo de la mitología griega de manera tan bella, simple y divertida. Estoy segura de que estos libros influenciaron mi elección de carrera y definieron la mitad de mi personalidad. Principalmente, mi obsesión con el color azul y mi amor por los tiburones.

Eso es todo. Me voy a releer el segundo de la saga y a esperar a que anuncien el cast de la serie de Disney+.

Percy, te adoro."
777,778,5,"Ok, first off let me start by saying how have I not read this series before??
Secondly, oh.my.god I was hooked from the first line-- no the first chapter title. And I enjoyed every single moment of reading it.
Percy Jackson, a 6th-grade half-blood boy was sent on a quest to the underworld to retrieve Zeus's lightning bolt in order to prevent another war but along the way, he discovered many things-- both good and bad about his life.
The plot is so intriguing there was no point in the book that was remotely boring. And the characters are so well-written that I would believe they actually existed. Percy's character voice is the most entertaining thing of all, I live for his sassy remarks. Though at first, I was quite unsure about the writing style since first person pov are usually not my cup of tea but after like 40% in, I loved reading it. Let me just say it's such an awesome read I have the urge to abandon my February tbr and just binge the whole series."
778,779,5,"Jedna z nejlepších knih co jsem letos přečetla :) a teď už můžu konečně říct, že je to daleko lepší než film, který tak trochu i pokazily a bohužel jsem ho i dříve viděla, ale když film vyšel, tak jsem vůbec nevěděla, že nějaká knížka existovala :D. Ze začátku jsem si myslela, že budu mít problém s věkem Percyho, ale nějak jsem to po celou dobu vůbec nevnímala :) a nechápu proč jsem si to sakra už nepřečetla dřív :D. Byl to krásný pohádkový příběh, sice asi spíše pro mladší čtenáře, ale i tak se mi to fakt strašně moc líbilo a já se nemůžu dočkat až si přečtu další díly. Rick Riordan je prostě skvělý spisovatel a já jsem ráda, že už aspoň vím proč je tolik oblíbený. Všem tuhle knížku můžu jenom doporučit!!! :)
Moje recenze -"
779,780,5,"I am so late to this fandom, BUT I AM SO EXCITED TO NOW JOIN THE PERCY JACKSON FANDOM. I honestly don't know what took me so long to read this book.



This book was action packed and hilarious. Rick Riordan's writing was addictive and I never felt like the characters were acting immature (considering they were 12 years old). Annabeth and Percy were fantastic. I don't really need to go on about this book because I am pretty sure everyone knows how great this book is.

TIME FOR BOOK TWO.



5 / 5 Fangs"
780,781,5,"""Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood"" is one of the most memorable opening lines for me. The Percy Jackson series is very addictive because you keep wanting more. How do I begin to describe Percy? Percy is very sarcastic and funny and always has crazy ideas. He loves his friends and will do anything for them. Unlike Harry Potter who loves the wizarding world and enjoys being a wizard from early on, Percy is hesitant and afraid of being a half-blood. When you look up hero in the dictionary Percy's picture is there. Sure, at times Percy may be reckless but, really his heart is big. This book made me laugh out loud multiple times and at the end, I waited in anticipation until I could get the next book.""The Lightning Thief"" is one of a kind and whenever I'm feeling down I know what book to take off my shelf."
781,782,5,"oh my dear lord...
i have become OBSESSED!!! ahhhhh. is it possible to love Rick Riordan more?!
this story just sucked me in and hasnt let go. the characters... percy, grover, annabeth...the gods... its such an enchanting story! i studied Greek mythology in my last grade and so some things mentioned were familiar. i love percy's trait of annoying gods. its funny until they send monsters to kill you...
my favorite character was probably annabeth... but i really liked percy and grover too.
chiron is super cool!! and Mr D... ah Mr D. what are we gonna do with you?
also can i just say? percy's mother is bad*ass. she should be regonized more!! everything she did was to protect her son... even marrying that pig, gabe.. *cue the curse words*
anyways.. im done ranting. onward to the next book!!"

Es increíble la cantidad de cosas que puedo olvidar en dos años. Fue mejor que la primera vez que lo leí. Gracias por ayudarme a salir de mi reading slump.

--------------------------------------------------------------------




Me la pase enamorada de la maldita película por años y ahora no se que pensar. Me han engañado.

Solo una cosa: durante todo el libro, no me dio la impresión de que Percy tuviera 12 años.

Sin duda ya quiero empezar The Sea of Monsters."
783,784,5,"This was one of my favorite series when I was a kid, and this is now the second time I’ve revisited it as a young adult. It still holds up as a fun and entertaining adventure that I’d go back to again and again. Greek mythology has always been interesting to me, so I really enjoy those elements as well.

The characters in this book are so great. Percy is a hero that’s brave and loyal, and I love how he adjusts to his exposure to this new world and lifestyle. Grover is hysterical and a Greta friend. Annabeth is my favorite and always will be because she’s brilliant and caring.

Percy Jackson and the Olympians was right up there with Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl for me as my favorite series growing up. It still holds up to this day, and I’m very excited to reread it again."
784,785,5,Yunan mitolojisi ne kadar güzel ve ilginç değil mi? 🤩Birkaç yıl önce bu kitabı okumuştum ve şimdi anladım ki çok bilinçsizce okumuşum. Kitap gerçekten çok güzel. Bilinçli bir şekilde okuyunca ne kadar güzel kurgulanmış olduğunu ve yunan mitolojisi ile bağlantılarının ne kadar açık ve insanı gözümde canlanır olduğunu anlıyorsunuz. 😍Size önerim bunun orjinal dilinde yani İngilizce bir şekilde okuyun🙃. Dili kesinlikle zor değil ayrıca sesli kitap halinde bir yandan dinlerken okursanız hem İngilizceniz gelişir hem de sonuçta bir kitabı orjinal dilinde okumak daha güzel olduğu için bence çok daha iyi hissedersiniz😉 elbette kitaba puanım 5/5🤭 İkinci kitabını okumak için sabırsızlanıyorum!☕️
785,786,5,"I decided to reread this (is like my fourth or fifth time) when I was struggling to get my f*ucking lungs to work. Mostly because I was feeling pretty bad, and I wanted to idk escape. And it worked! Kind of.
I have so much love for this characters, this story, and what it means to me, even now, that of course is going to be a 5 stars!
I think stories like Percy, Harry Potter, ATLA, etc, stories you'd grew up with, always reminds us why we take so much pleasure in fiction; and coming back to them feels like meeting an old friend.
I'm making sense? I think not haha. But anyway, onto the next book."
786,787,5,"I’ve missed reading this series so much, it’s been so long I almost forgot how addicting the story is.

I don’t think it can be said enough how good Rick Riordan is at creating realistic characters (Annabeth will forever be one of my favorite fictional characters) and situations that are equally as funny as they are action packed. I wasn’t sure when I started rereading this if I would continue with the rest of the series again but I definitely am. I’ve forgotten so much about the stories and I freaking LOVE them so much I want to experience it all again.

I’d definitely give this book 6 stars if I could."
787,788,5,"One big thing that amazes me about this favorite book is that even though I have reread it several times as I get older (even when Goodreads was not recording rereads), I feel like the book's themes get darker and more serious, as if the book also ages with me. I wonder how I'll analyze this book as an old person. Haha. Maybe I'd be like Charon!

For the record, Percy's still my favorite smart-ass rebel and badass delinquent. Also, ""The Lightning Thief"" is still the best middle-grade series opener for me."
788,789,5,"First read: October 15, 2013

Wow! I'm really happy I jumped on this bandwagon, because
this novel was epic!

Second read: November 3 to November 8, 2023

Re-visiting this novel 10 years after I originally read it was so much fun. I never continued on with this series, and this re-read definitely made me want to change that. Rick Riordan has a knack for creating such lovable, fun characters with high-stakes adventure around every corner. Can’t wait for the TV show adaptation to drop!"
789,790,5,"Este libro fue simplemente fantástico, me demore un poco a la hora de leerlo, por que lo hice en ingles, pero aun así me pareció muy entretenido y muy cómico, con un ingles muy fácil de entender (recomendado para los que quieren empezar a leer en este idioma)
Rick Riordan es un cómico nato, en cada momento Percy Jackson me sacaba una sonrisa o una carcajada, y esto hizo que el se convirtiera en uno de mis personajes de ficción favoritos.
Esto muy ansioso de seguir con los libros, por que su historia es extraordinaria."
790,791,5,"Sinceramente no sé cómo no comencé esta saga antes.
Pocos libros han hecho que me quedara hasta la madrugada leyéndolos y este es uno de ellos.

Este libro es fantástico, la mezcla entre la mitología griega y la actualidad me atrapó por completo, tiene una narración detallada, pero no aburrida o exasperante. Nada que decir de los personajes, simplemente me encantaron.

Le tengo mucha fe a esta saga, espero que no me decepcione en los libros siguientes porque hasta el momento me está encantando.

Le doy cinco estrellas porque se las merece."

With the help of a satyr and a daughter of Athena, Percy must journey across the United States to catch a thief who has stolen the original weapon of mass destruction — Zeus’ master bolt. Along the way, he must face a host of mythological enemies determined to stop him. Most of all, he must come to terms with a father he has never known, and an Oracle that has warned him of betrayal by a friend.
Better than the film I got on DVD."

This book changed my life. My teacher had started reading this book aloud to the class. I was so captivated that a few days later I grabbed my brothers copy of Sea Of Monsters. I started reading it. I devoured book after book. I fangirled about Percy and Nico. I wouldn't be who I am today without these books. After all I hadn't liked to read before I read these books. Thank you Rick Riordan for writing these books and changing my life."
793,794,5,"It has been a long time since a book has engulfed me as much as this one did. I can't say enough good things. I absolutely loved this book and I can't wait to start the second. With the understanding that this novel and series is directed to a younger audience, I recommend it to everyone. It has the same elements and draw that the Harry potter series had. If you are open to taking a step into young adult fiction, look no further."
794,795,5,"Habe dieses Buch mit der lieben Steffy zusammen gelesen!

Ich muss sagen das Buch ist wirklich anders als die Filme bzw. anders herum aber trotzdem hat es so viel Humor gezeigt und Sarkasmus und Abenteuer und vorallem: Griechische Götter und Anabeth, Grover und Percy: da musste ich es einfach lieben :) Ich freue mich eifnach mal sooo sehr auf den 2. Band - kanns kaum erwarten, auch wenn ich den 2. Film auch schon kenne ;)"

Percy es un personaje bastante divertido. las aventuras que vive junto con sus amigos, fueron muy bien redactadas y muy positivas para la historia

Es una historia que recomiendo mucho, que a pesar de que me demore demasiado leyéndolo, valió la pena, por que la disfrute demasiado y tengo muchos ganas de leer su 2° parte.

I can't believe it's been so long since I read this for the first time, but it really did feel like coming back to an old friend. There was so much in here that I just completely forgot about and a whole bunch of other things I got confused with the movie and later books and maybe just my own imagination. This is a downright joy."
797,798,5,"Rereading this after 10+ years was an experience. It still holds up strong and is a fun read with great set of characters. Percy, Annabeth and Grover are still remarkable and really carries the series.

I’m definitely excited to reread more books in the series. I’ve forgotten how fun and exciting this series is."
798,799,5,"I loved this book :) It's full of action so I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was right there on the adventure with Percy, Grover, and Annabeth. I love how the author puts in fantasy creatures and fantasy battle sequences while at the same time keeping the settings easy to understand. I will definitely read some more books in the Percy Jackson series."

865,866,5,"My nephew was reading this because we bought him the series. He asked me to read it with him so I did. I totally found myself enjoying this book. This was so much of a blast of a book to read. As I was reading this book, I remember what it was like to be a kid again. This book really made me feel like I was reading for fun again. Percy Jackson and his friends really were just like any other kids, but have all these weird and crazy things happen to them because being kids of Gods, nothing is ever simple.

Percy Jackson doesn’t seem to be having a good day or even a good week when we first meet him. He seems like a kid who has been hallucinating. Only problem is that Percy is not imagining or hallucinating the things he sees. Percy doesn’t realize that what he is seeing is real. This was really well done and well played. He thinks that he is going crazy. I would too if I saw the things that he saw in the book.
Plus he has to deal with his mother, and Grover telling him some pretty crazy things about him being the child of a god. He also finds that Grover is a satyr and has to bring him to a place that houses half-bloods like himself. Nothing is ever easy because every mythological creature is after him and he doesn’t understand why. I thought that the first few chapters were very action packed. Percy and Grover definitely seem to have an adventure with a minotaur and all the craziness indeed. Percy doesn’t really know what to do, but he manages to defeat him. Him and Grover somehow manage to make it to Camp Half Blood.

At Camp Half-Blood, Percy discovers a whole lot of things about who he is related to and not in a good way through a lot of different actions. Plus, there a lot of children who are like him, Half-Bloods, Half-God, half-humans. I thought that the other children were interesting and our great. I totally find that Annabeth was a lot of fun (plus she is a NY Yankees fan, so I like her immediately). He finds out through an accident that he is the son of Poseidon. So of course, things get more interesting.

Percy gets accused of doing something that he didn’t know. This leads to a crazy quest of course for him. I totally find how fun the quest was for Percy and his friends. The other Gods seem determined not to help him or setting him up for their own nefarious purposes. Some of the Gods want Percy to fail or die. He has decided to take on a hero’s journey which is never easy. I totally love the quest and all the crazy things that he has to experience along with his friends. The aspect of the mythology was great. Plus, the use of the God’s themselves was something that I didn’t expect. I find that this series charming and I am glad that my nephew asked me to read it with him."
866,867,5,"Wham bam pow and holy cow i loved this!!!! Rick Riordan, you've got yourself a brand spankin' new fan.

I feel like I have been waiting years for an MC like Percy after sloshing through garbagey protagonists that make dumb decisions and are not worthy of chosen-one status purely because they're not enjoyable to read about and they suck. BUT PERCY! Percy is a real boy! He has smart thoughts! He has flaws and a really hard life but he manages to be likable and his own person; not a self-insert for the reader, but relatable enough that you empathize and root for him! And the other characters too were perfectly inhabited by personalities, emotions, and goals that didn't all center around a chosen one... they just so happened to coexist with his presence.

At every point when I was sure a character would disappoint my jaded expectations, I was wildly surprised by their wit and how compelling they really were. Chiron's steady faith in the kids, Percy's comforting words to Grover about being the one to find Pan, Annabelle's persistent but playful teasing weighed with her intellect, Grover's bleating just enough times to make you smile but not so many that it was his only character trait (sorry, sorry, again, I've read a lot of bad books), Crusty's salesmanship, and the gods' towering presences! All of it added to this wonderful, immersive world I was thrilled to be exploring. I was never bored once and hung on every word. Creating lore that centers Greek gods can be touchy but I think it was done so well and I'm absolutely stoked for the next book.

I have to admire the sheer craftsmanship of this work. You can often tell when an author has given up on a book and just wants it published and done with. But Rick Riordan meticulously planned this book and I'm assuming all others after it, because as the layers of this story are peeled away, you see the threads that tie everything together come together bit by bit. You don't have to wait for an info dump at the end, there are no sudden pivots into bizarre territory for the genre, and you genuinely wonder ""how would I solve this problem if I were in their shoes?"" instead of screaming ""NO!! DON'T GO IN THE BASEMENT NOOOO!!!"" The pacing is just right and there are so many careful touches to this story that I so highly appreciate.

If I were to break into a family of bears' home and claim their food and beds for myself, this would be that juuuuuust-right-yes-ahhh-perfect baby bear book equivalent. I might just break in again."
867,868,5,"HEY GUYS. (FINALLY, I have time to write a review!)

This is my first Rick Riordan book! And I have to say, it was an awesome ride!

The crazy shi- I mean adventures that Percy + gang experienced were WILD. Running into trouble at every turn during their quest? LOL.

Also, I swear I had a feeling I knew who would betray them. (I won't mention any spoilers;) LIKE, I honestly had a mental list of the few friends Percy had..and tried narrowing it down LOL.

Things I liked:
1. The TRIO! Percy, Grover and Annabeth remind me of a certain magical trio...lol. I love how they grew to work together! Grover is pretty hilarious. And I love how Percy sticks up for his friends! <3 Annabeth is basically Hermione soo how can you end up hating her? :P

2. CHIRON. He's not really a main character in the book but he was pretty helpful to Percy. I still wonder what he' hiding? Or am i just reading too much into little details? lol. B/c I still think about that one scene in the beginning of the novel, where Percy see's a shadow in the upstairs attic curtain? And Chiron brushes it off?

3. THE GODS. Were so cool. I really liked reading about Hades hahah. Especially how he got so exasperated about the work environment down in the underworld. And it's cool to see the Gods as humans too, like Ares lol in the biker gear. I'm sure we'll see more of Poseidon in book 2!!??

4. Percy's MOM. I love how she makes the blue pancakes lol so cute. I also hope everything works out for her and Percy in NYC! But obvs, we know he's gonna be thrown back into the world of monstersssss :P

5. I wonder if the gang will be back together again? (probs?)

6. AND GROVER'S QUEST to find Pan! I wonder if he'll make it back to Camp Half Blood and reunite w/ Percy and Annabeth!?

Things I didn't like:
1. How the gang kept FINDING trouble. Literally every time they (barely) made it out alive from one adventure they immediately find trouble AGAIN. LOL It annoyed me so much that bc of all the crazy people they ran into....they can;t be a little more careful/cautious/SUS of their surroundings/people?

2. that's about the only thing i didn't like lol. um, I wish there was a cliffhanger at the end? lol

okay bye:)

BTW I've reaad up to chapter 2 in Sea of Monsters lol. I can't wait to read moreeee:)"

869,870,5,"giving this book five stars for nostalgic reasons; when reading it, it felt closer to a 4 star read tbh...

I've read the series ~10 years ago and don't remember how it ends (I don't even think I ever read the 5th book tbh), which is why I am re-reading it. I also only read the first three books of Heroes of Olympus and before I continue that, I felt like a re-read of PJO was neccessary.
I still remembered the whole plot of the book... I've watched the movie a couple of times and know the musical soundtrack by heart, so I am not really surprised by how little the book surprised me.
I still love the book, especially the banter, but the writing style was sometimes a bit simple and because there were so many summarizing sentences, it felt a bit too quick.
But I know that Rick Riordans work kept improving over the years so I can definitely recommend this series. But like, keep in mind that the series was aimed at teenagers and was written 15 years ago, when not so many of these fantasy/coming of age/heroic stories were published"
870,871,5,"“Even strength must bow to wisdom sometimes.”

Oh my god what an incredible read! I've been saying for ages that I wanted to pick this up and now that I've done it I'm completely impressed, it's even better than I imagined.

Everything about this is perfect! The peace, characters, mystery, action, world, every single description, the writing perfect amount of combination between Percy's thoughts and telling the story.

And omg it really was so funny sometimes, I was constantly giggling to myself. I had the best of times.

I really can't wait to continue with this series and, in general, with the whole universe of these books, I read this in one sitting I was constantly wanting to get more of it! This was such an experience."
871,872,5,"It hasn't happened to me for i don't know how long to immerse myself in a reading and have the sensation of not reading but living that story. The settings and the events with references to Greek mythology literally overwhelmed me. It was all an emotional roller coaster.
The comfort i found in the pages of this book was much more than a warm embrace. I laughed and got emotional through the eyes of percy, annabeth and groover. They are THE trio and the definition of a found family trope.
They faced everything but they stayed together until the end, helping each other and never losing hope and they made me want to have such a sincere and deep friendship.

“you will be a great hero, child”
just saying that i had the chills because i know that too and can't wait to see percy grow into who he's meant to be.
I had high expectations but this book even exceeded them"
872,873,5,"I could not stop smiling while I read this. This book brought me pure joy. I loved every single word Rick Riordan wrote.


I watched the Percy Jackson movie when it first came out (many years ago) and I LOVED IT. Absolutely completely loved it. Obviously I wanted to read the book, but it wasn’t translated in my language and at the time I didn’t understand enough English to read the original. Alas, I only watched the movie. I heard so many times that it sucks and that I should just read the damn book, but I never got it, because like I said, I LOVED the movie. And it’s has Logan Lerman in it so… Even my 12 year old self knew that that has to count for something. I get it now. The movie is shit."
873,874,5,"Aaamm...nu ma asteptam sa imi placa cartea asta asa mult?
Trebuie sa recunosc ca a fost o surpriza pentru mine. O incepusem pentru ca aveam nevoie de ceva usor si relaxant care sa ma scoata din mini reading slump-ul in care intrasem. Nu pornisem cu super asteptari de la ea, desi auzisem pareri bune. Ma asteptam la o carte ok, draguta si usor de citit, dar nimic mai mult.
Totusi, mi-a intrecut cu mult asteptarile si m-a impresionat. Plot bine construit, personaje faine si rasturnari de situatie, ce puteam sa vreau mai mult? Mai mult decat atat, detaliile despre mitologia greaca m-au facut sa vreau sa aflu mai multe despre acest subiect, lucru la care nu ma asteptam. Trebuie sa recunosc ca tocmai aceasta parte a cartii ma oprea sa o citesc si sa o las neatinsa 3 ani in biblioteca(s-a dovedit ca impresia mea a fost total gresita).
Cartea m-a tinut in priza pe tot parcursul actiunii, m-a facut sa rad cu pofta si s-a citit foarte usor si pot sa spun ca majorita personajelor m-au cucerit.
Cam atat ups, abia astept sa citesc si celelalte volume si celelalte serii ale autorului."
874,875,5,"I never read these books as a child despite being around the right age to when they came out. Upon revealing this to my friends Zar and Umbar that I had never read them their exact words were ""that’s awful please begin immediately,"" And so I did.

And what a joy this book turned out to be. I know that if I had read them as a kid I would have loved them and become obsessed with them and greek mythology. As an adult who already knows a lot about classical mythology I was equally enchanted. The story was enjoyable the characters charming and the spin on greek mythology novel and interesting.

This book lived up to the hype and I look forward to reading the rest."

Me encanto el libro.

Me encanta la mitología griega asique ame el libro, lo súper híper recomiendo, seguro en estos días me compro el 2 JAJSJSJS

Me encanta la aparición de todos los personajes y lo que cuentan de ellos, me encantaron los personajes.

Solo no me gusto una cosa.
(SPOILER)(SPOILER)
(SPOILER)(SPOILER)

Me pareció rara la parte del hotel, tipo como pasan días de la nada en cuestión de segundos, si decían q el jefe era algo de la mitología griega y explicaban q ya había hecho lo mismo como con Crusty y Teseo lo entendía pero me pareció re raro."
878,879,5,"Eu tenho um carinho imenso pela história do Percy desde os meus 9 anos de idade. Fiquei com receio de que relendo estragaria de alguma forma a memoria especial que eu tenho desse livro na minha infância. Mas pelo contrário, esse livro me divertiu demais e eu continuo amando os personagens, o universo do acampamento meio sangue e a narrativa. ♡
È incrível como o Rick Riordan consegue abordar a mitologia grega de forma a criar uma relação íntima com deuses, monstros e mitos que, mesmo ainda muito presentes na cultura ocidental, as vezes se restringem a uma bolha. A mitologia, nesse livro, se torna algo acessível e empolgante pra qualquer um. Sério, Rick Riordan, muito obrigada por esse clássico."
879,880,5,"Review: An engrossing adventure tale of a demigod, bound for a quest that will change his life forever. This is a new favorite!

Finally, I have read Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief! I am now a new member of the Camp Half-Blood, bound too for a quest - to finish reading the entire books of the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles."
880,881,5,"Such a great read!! I'm surprised I never read it when it first came about. I remember enjoying the movie but the book is so so so much better! I love the writing styles, it makes you feel like you're right there with Percy the whole way! Definitely recommend to anyone who knows how to read. Now on to the next one!

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
881,882,5,"All I have to say is...... how could I have not have read this series sooner!??

WOW. Amazing! Just amazing! I’ve been pulled into this story since the very first page and finished it in 2 days! This was such a great read! Words can’t describe how much I enjoyed this."
882,883,5,"This was such a funnnn readdd!
Can’t believe it took me this long to fully read the first book, I am definitely wanting to reread the entire series at this point cause ughhhh I missed these characters and Greek mythology so much and I need some of this in my life. It also is such a nice, quick summer read that I’m needing right now with school starting soon and me realizing I have a ton of hwk I need to get to and notes so I’m so happpyyy about this!

Percy is so sassy and brave but has been through so much like can I please hug him. Annabeth is such a badass and also needs a hug. Grover is such an innocent, pure person🥺.

Pjo is one of the first books that actually made me love reading so much so to be back and rereading them now is so refreshing and nostalgic."
883,884,5,"No entiendo cómo Percy no había llegado antes a mi vida, lo detesto por posponerlo antes, LO AME, LO AMO MUCHO Y MUY FUERTE, no puedo esperar a empezar el siguiente, por todos los dioses del Olimpo adoré este libro GRACIAS RICK RIORDAN"
884,885,5,Another for the YA reading challenge! I can see why so many love this series—the first book is equal parts warm & thrilling; comedic & thoughtful. It’s clear that Rick Riordan wanted to give kids a world that empowered them. Loved trying to puzzle out all the references to Greek myths before they were revealed.
885,886,5,I can't believe I didn't read this book earlier! What a fantastic start to a series!! Going to keep reading <3
886,887,5,I love Percy Jackson. This book was so fun. I went on an amazing adventure and I'm sad its over. Its definitely time for the next book
887,888,5,"The main character of the Lightning Thief is Percy Jackson, a twelve-year-old diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD. Percy is not very popular, usually he gets kicked out of school before the year end.

The character of Percy is described to be a normal american teenager to make him more realistic which works. He himself doesn't feel to be hero or have any special godly powers. The book is an old mythology set into a modern world just like Neil Geiman does, which I really love. I learned a lot of things from mythogy which I have already forgot since the school years. The best I of course liked again the Underworld or kingdom of Hades. All the magical creatures - Cerberus, dog in Underworld, Medusa, the world of Olympus, left me fascinated and wanted to learn more. I will for sure come back to this series again. This was not my last Percy Jackson adventure. Highly recommended."

Kocham Grovera (ikona i gwiazda całej książki), Annabeth, Percy’ego i taką jedną osobę, którą kochałam a nagle na końcu… BOOM. W ogóle wszystko na końcu było super, wiwat, hurra, aż nagle bum.

928,929,5,"I’ve always loved the movies in this franchise and yep, I watched the movies before reading the books (shock horror- I do normally read the books first but not on this occasion) and seriously loved the books more than the film!

Although they are different from one another with a few central running themes, so if you’re seen the film and are expecting it to be the exactly same in the book, you may be disappointed! I always like to read the book first so there’s no comparisons to the books but I loooved the book here.

It was a really entertaining story with a compelling plot, and a great typical ‘hero chosen one’ theme which I just loved. It was a really easy and enjoyable read and one that is so easy to slip into it.

I can’t wait to read more of the books in this series and I’m so glad there are plenty within this bookverse to be getting on with!"
929,930,5,"Good soup

I didn’t have the highest hopes for this series, mainly because I started reading it in Swedish a couple of years ago and found the writing very childish.

Then I started listening to the audiobook and realized that — wow — I need to ACTUALLY read this. So I ordered the box set and diced right in…

AND OH MY GOSH.

I love the writing, I love the story, I love the mythology and I love our unique trio that we get to follow.

This was such an easy but giving read that brings the reader on a great adventure! I must continue with the second book straight away."

933,934,5,I wasn't really interested in the Percy Jackson series and my friend kept telling me to read it so I decided to. It was a really good book and I was surprised because I didn't have high expectations for it. I will for sure read the other 4 books and something I liked about the book is that we got to know what percy was at the same time as he did.
934,935,5,"“You shall go west and find the god who has turned,

- The Oracle

As much as I love YA fantasy reads, middle grade reads have a spot in my heart. I have read few middle - grade fantasy and each of those reads have been on par if not more thrilling and captivating. I may be late in the Percy Jackson reading club, but I was very grateful that I decided to pick it up again, give it a try as my first Rick Riordan read, and continue with the next 4 books.

Though I have watched the films, I was still left captivated by the events of this book especially the plot build up and other scenes which have been missed in the film namely:

✅ Why his mother stayed with his stepfather for years despite the harsh treatment
✅ The cabins and their representations
✅ The reason as to why the three gods are in conflict
✅ The visions and dreams of Percy
✅ Annabeth’s backstory
✅ The other monsters faced along the way
✅ The battle with Ares
and a lot more.

Suffce to say, I loved Percy’s journey into knowing his heritage in this more than how it was portrayed in the films. It felt much gradual in revelation and more impactful rather than him suddenly being branded as Poseidon’s son. Also, the plot as to who stole what and who ordered whom is vastly different to the film and yet the book’s flow captivated me more. The book’s events gave more depth to what was happening and gives the readers a foreshadowing of a greater adventure to come.

Moreover, this book sated my greek mythology interest. I have long been in love with greek mythology and is my favorite topic when discussing World literatures. To see a book incorporating characters connected by these stories is amazing more so when they all are woven together to create a new story that keeps me turning the pages until the wee hours of the night. Not to mention the many near dearh experiences the trio got themselves into and out off. I know it is not wise to compare characters across books but Percy, Annabeth, and Grover remind me of Harry, Hermione, and Ron’s dynamics as a trio and by the time I flipped the last pages, I know I’ll wish to follow them throughout their quests much as I followed Harry, Hermione, and Ron to their final stand off.

Another aspect I adored was the character portrayal. I loved Percy, Annabeth, and Grover’s portrayal in the books than in the film which makes me understand why many people resented the latter. Like young adult fantasy characters, they all show bravery, courage, and superb fighting skills but with them being in the cusp of adolescence, it is expected for them to have remnants of their childish mentality which does not fail to show in certain moments.

As much as Annabeth is wise and intelligent, her resentment to Percy based on the rivalry of their parents protrays her childish tendency to “hate the enemies of your family”. Likewise, Percy showed anger for his father’s absence, anger on the gods for the chaos they have caused, and gullibility to simple things such as the smell of hamburgers. However, all these were balanced off by them showcasing occasions of maturity and growth along the way.

As for Grover, he wasn’t portrayed to be the plain-old protector sidekick with bouts of heroic courage in certain occassions. He felt more of a part of the team rather than just a filler for the trio which is the vibes the film gave. I was satisfied with his portrayal in the books that I cannot picture him in any other way.

Overall, I am in love with this book, its story, its characters, and its world. I am utterly glad that I decided to give it a chance because it left me in awe and still begging for more adventures."
935,936,5,"Warning: really long ass review because this was a reread and now I'm gettin picky
Before I start, I'd like to say most of my gripe with this book was because I kept forgetting the main characters are literally 12 years old and that this is a middle grade. Also, wtf camp counselors? Who tf gives 3 kids $100 to get across the country.

I read this for the first time when I was in middle school and loved it.... 7ish years later, I'm 19 years old and I still loved this book. This book is phenomenal, I mean what more could you want from a (middle grade) fantasy/mythology book?

Ok, to get the negative critiques out of the way, I didn't like the dialogue. I found myself getting really annoyed reading it, specifically reading dialogue from all the mythological creatures. Like yeah, yeah the oracle and fate or whatever, but you really don't gotta sound all profound. This was the only moment when I felt like Riordan maybe thought he was writing like some hard hitting stuff? But then I remembered this was a middle grade, so it's fine I guess. Also, didn't appreciate Clarisse being referred to as ""big girl Clarisse"" for like an entire chapter, that got old really fast and it made me sad.

Also, I hated the fact that Annabeth had a crush on Luke and how she acted around him, but that's probably because I don't like Luke. I mean, yeah, she's twelve, but wow she couldn't function at all around him huh? Also, the scene with the water park.... Percy said, ""Leave it to the girl to make everything complicated"" ..... Rick, Richard, my guy what's with that my friend? You can't just paint Annabeth has this smart, intelligent, bad ass twelve year old that lot's of little girls could look up to and then just make Percy say that ignorant line. I don't care that they're twelve, I didn't appreciate it considering Percy would be that much more lost through this whole figuring out you're a demigod shit without her. And then to make her completely paralyzed when the mechanical spiders come out, making it almost feel like that fear made her completely useless now and for a while. Not cute....

Ok, now some positives.... I forgot just how funny this book is and how SASSY Percy motherfuckin Jackson is!!!! I LOVED IT!!!! I was laughing out loud for at least a minute straight and if you know me, then you know that's a big deal because I don't really react to my books.

The plot of this book is so entertaining as well. For someone who loses focus/can't read for extremely long periods of time, I was really engaged in the story and always had a want to just keep reading. Whenever I put the book down I immediately thought to myself to pick it up again. Although, I would've liked to have seen more from the Lotus Hotel scene and a little less from the waterpark scene. I just thought there were lots of things that could've been explored with the Hotel, for example, why? Why are they drawing people in and making them stay for years at a time? Also, how exactly are they doing this? It was just a really cool, interesting, and fun scene I wish I had more of.

This is just a phenomenal book. The characters, the monsters, the plot, everything is just so well done and enjoyable. I mean years after I first read this book and I still love it just as much. Also, the representation that was in this book?????!!!!!!!!! We're got learning disability representation before we could even realize it was there in the first place!! But when Rick casually threw in mentionings of abuse in this story, highlighting how it's wrong and introducing this to young readers. It's honestly phenomenal. 4 or 4.5 stars (GOODREADS LET US DO DECIMAL RATINGS)"
936,937,5,"I had no idea! I knew this is a popular series and has a huge fan base but I did not expect to find something so immersive and delightful. This is a great first book for a series. It introduces the reader to a new (but actually ancient) fantasy world without revealing all its cards - I somehow know that there is much more to come in terms of world building itself. It also sets up a villain through emotion rather than physical presence which works in its favour and is making me reach for the second book. It also has a great balance between hilarity and depth, without having to resort to melodrama for the latter.

I liked Percy's voice and found that though I could deduce more than him in the first half of the book, he definitely had the upper hand in the second and kept his secrets well, maintaining narrative tension. The one thing I had difficulty settling into was the episodic way in which it was written in the middle, where it seemed like the three main characters kept repeating their mistakes and ran into monsters and traps too easily. While I got the intent behind it and enjoyed the rewriting of Greek myths, it took away from the main plot for me sometimes. I also felt that the rewriting of myths could add even to the core story or to the character, and not just add modern-day external details.

What I admired most about the book is how it preserves the conflict between agency and fate that Greek myths often have. It is brought up at different points in the book but in a very evocative way at the end by presenting a morally gray character who asks to be both understood and derided. What I also loved is how the book made me think about power in parent-child relationships. And at its end, I felt that Percy too has been left with so much to think about, especially what it means to be a hero and who he wants to hold close as greater threats loom in front of him.

Even as I write about what I liked about this book, I understand that I have large expectations from the rest of the series. I'm so glad I am spoiler-free for it - I literally have no idea what's coming, not even a hint of it!"
937,938,5,"The first time I read this book was in fourth grade. It was a class read, and I remember how much fun we had with it. I remember staying in from recess so I could finish an assignment that had been given to us after we finished up chapter three. We had been assigned to draw the scene when Percy first flees the cabin with Grover and his mom. I remember being assigned Aphrodite to research after we finished the book and wearing my Halloween costume (a Greek goddess costume) on the day I was supposed to present. I also remember the Olympics we did and the fact that I got two medals (candy on the end of two ribbons) in the long jump and racing competitions. I was the only girl to win a medal and for the racing competition, the boy in fourth place swore he was ahead of me and the teachers counted wrong. (dude, don't lie, I was miles ahead).

That was years ago. Even though I didn't really realize it until I reread this book for the second time, very much shaped the way I read now.

I don't think I've ever rated a middle-grade book 5 stars. Even thinking back on books I read back in elementary school, I didn't really love any middle-grade books. Sure, I liked them plenty. But if I were to rate them (even though I had no concept of rating books back then), they would have been a solid 3 or 4-star. Even Harry Potter--I only rated the 5th book five stars (it used to also be the fourth, but I ended up bumping it down to a 4 after my last reread), and at the point in the series, the books have definitely graduated from middle-grade. But, something about this book drew me in.

First off, at its core, this book is a story about friendship and family. It's a classic topic. That being said, I don't usually reach for books where those are the main themes. But the relationships in the story are beautiful, and I can't wait to see them grow throughout the series. Percy's relationship with his mom is wonderful. Sally's love towards her son instantly puts her on top of the literature mom list.


The deadpan humor was perfect. There were a lot of instances where I laughed out loud because a line genuinely caught me off guard. The classic 'you drool in your sleep line' comes to mind. But there was also the scene where Poseidon admits he kind of wishes that Percy would have never been born because of what Percy is going to have to go through and Percy's kind of like ""Damn. Alright."" because all he hears is his dad telling him that he wishes Percy would have never been born.

The plot is top tier. Riordan really creates a world that's very easy to jump in despite being so complicated. I don't really have any other comments other than I thought that the editions of all the monsters really kept the plot going.



If you can't tell, this book is really good. 10/10"
938,939,5,"the way I had forgotten almost everything and thought it happened just like in the movie doesn't sit right with me, thank goodness I'm finally rereading this series I started bookstagram with and I'm sooo in love like the first time I read it 😍😍😍"
939,940,5,
940,941,5,"Por fin he leido a Percy *suena un coro de angeles cantando Aleluya* y lo hice en un impulso, para no caer en un paron de lectura, veran La Cruz Ardiente me esta sacando canas y no precisamente por algo emocionante sino por aburrido. Asi que busque otra lectura y ahi estaba Percy diciendo LEEME y de esa forma empece mi viaje por el campamento mestizo y la mitologia griega.

Aclaro una cosita esta mitologia no es mi preferida me gusta mas la Egipcia, lastima que Las Cronicas de KAne solo hubieran sido tres libro, pero Riordan como siempre se las ingenia para traerte una historia maravillosa, que tiene muchos elementos buenos y con eso aprovecha para darte una catedra sobre los dioses. Siempre me han gustado los libros que me enseñan distintas cosas y Percy no es la excepcion de esa regla.

De que va la historia, por si como yo no lo has leido y quieres ver la opinion de los demas, Percy es un chico de 12 años dislexico y con THDA (Trastorno de Hiperactividad y Deficit de Atencion) al cual le cuesta integrarse a una escuela por lo que ya ha cambiado 6 veces de recinto. Todo cambia cuando es atacado por una maestra de su ultima escuela, la cual se transforma en una Furia uno de los monstruos del inframundo, despues de ahi todo se vuelve una tormenta de sucesos cuando otros demonios intentan acabar con Percy. De esa manera para protegerlo terminara en el campamento mestizo y se enterara de la verdad, que su padre es nada mas y nada menos que un Dios Griego. Y a todo eso se le suma el robo del arma mas poderosa del Olimpo, el Rayo de Zeus quien esta desesperado por recuperarlo asi empiece otra guerra contra sus hermanos. Percy se vera envuelto en la busqueda del rayo y por ende pondra en peligro su vida de nuevo.

La verdad es un libro que en ningun monmento decae en la trama, cada vez avanza y avanza mas y mas, lo que da muchos puntos a favor. Los personajes estan bien desarrollados y espero que al igual que en Harry Potter, tengan un crecimiento y una evolucion fantastica. La parte mitologica esta muy bien presentada, no es facil tratar de enseñarle a los niños historia y mucho menos tan antigua como esa pero Riordan lo hace super sencillo y a parte que moderniza la situacion de los dioses. Otra cosa que me gusto mucho es el tema de la Dislexia y el THDA, veran pocas veces en los libros vemos personajes con una incapacidad de este tipo y me encanto que Riordan lo plasmara, mi Mama es Docente Especial y trata niños con dificultad del aprendizaje por eso estoy familiarizada con los terminos, asi que otra razon mas para adorar a Riordan.

No tengo quejas de este libro, se los recomiendo a todo aquel que no lo haya leido y no se preocupen este es un libro que no importa la edad que tengas te atrapa y no lo sueltas hasta que lo terminas, creanme lo compruebo voy a cumplir 22 años y me fascino de principio a fin."
941,942,5,"really enjoyed percy very fun protagonist to read through with. most of all of this book had me engaged, exploring an intricate world that i didnt know the rules of didnt get super confusing. and now i cant get yelled at for not reading it! i recommend"
942,943,5,"First of all, this review contains spoilers so BEWARE! I had to re-read this book because I LOVE PERCY JACKSON WITH MY LIFE!! Seriously, I LOVE HIM, I LOVE HIM, I LOOOOOOVEEEE HIM!! I read all of Percy’s books four years ago and I think my love for them keeps growing.

This book follows a 12 year old kid who lives in New York with his mom, Sally Jackson and his stepfather, Smelly Gabe. He’s a troubled kid and he thinks his father is dead. But guess what? His father is NOT dead and he is a GOD. Anyway, he goes to Half-Blood Hill and meets a lot of kids and then he realizes he’s a demigod. He goes on a quest to find the Lightning Bolt that was stolen from Zeus and has to return it in 10 days. He has to fight a lot of monsters on his way to the Underworld. Also, he’s going to be betrayed by one of his friends.

Even though Percy (Seaweed Brain) is a 12 year old kid, he’s brave, strong, a really good friend and has beautiful feelings. I'm pretty sure y'all know he is Poseidon's son. He can breathe underwater, HOW COOL IS THAT? He was always bullied at school or anywhere so he was pretty sad most of the time. I love how much he loves his mother and how loyal he is to his new friends. He wants to keep kicking demon’s asses along with Annabeth and Grover. Well, Grover left to find PAN.

Annabeth is this pretty girl with blond hair and gray eyes who had a tough childhood. She’s Athena’s daughter. She’s brave, but really brave!! And she cares about Percy a lot. She nursed Percy when he was attacked by the minotaur and later when a scorpion almost kill him. !

Grover, the amazing satyr, is Percy’s protector. According to him, he had failed a lot so he was worried that he wouldn’t help Percy on his quest. BUT… HE DID AN AMAZING JOB! After the quest, he acquired a permission to go look for the great god Pan. Everyone’s happy about that but sad at the same time because no searcher had ever come back alive.

I love all of Percy’s books. This one has a fantastic introduction to the greek mythology. You don’t need to read a book about greek mythology before reading this book because Rick Riordan explain everything very well throughout this story. Such a fantastic story with amazing characters. I don’t think I hate a character in this book. Actually, I love all of them and sometimes I feel sad about them. Luke was the “bad” kid and I still like him. Anyway, still my favorite books ever. OH, I’m planning to re-read soon."
943,944,5,"""No one can choose your path, Percy. You must decide.""

Este primer libro de la saga fue la sorpresa más grande que me he llevado este año. La verdad es que no se por qué no había empezado con este mundo antes, bueno sí se, cuando era más chica me intimidaba la cantidad de libros, pero este año por fin me decidí a empezarlos y me encantó, estoy muy emocionada por seguir leyendo al autor.

Esta primera entrega de la saga trata sobre Percy, quien es niño un poco problemático, gracias a su dislexia y a su déficit atencional no le va muy bien en el colegio, no tiene muchos amigos ya que está constantemente cambiando de escuela, cuando no está en periodo de clases, vive con su madre y su detestable padrastro en un departamento en Nueva York. Todo en su vida es bastante regular hasta que tras un encuentro con su profesora de pre álgebra, descubre que es un mestizo, un semidios, y que el único lugar seguro para él es el Campamento Mestizo.

Ahora, junto con sus nuevos amigos, deberá empezar una misión para devolver el rayo que le han robado a Zeus y evitar que se desate una guerra.

El libro me atrapó desde la página 1, literalmente, amo que rompa la cuarta pared dirigiéndose directamente al lector, estaba alucinando. Algo que me gustó mucho del libro es que uno va descubriendo todo este mundo y todo sobre mitología griega junto a Percy, quien, al igual que tú, no sabe qué está pasando y debe descubrirlo a medida que su misión avanza, por lo que uno nunca llega a sentirse perdido en la historia.

Los personajes son maravillosos, me hicieron reir demasiado a lo largo de todo el libro, sobretodo Percy y Grover. No suele pasarme que una historia me haga reír en voz alta así que valoro mucho eso. Annabeth es maravillosa y tengo muchas ganas de conocerla mejor.

Por último, quiero destacar la forma que tiene el autor de entregar mensajes y hacer reflexionar al lector sobre temas tan relevantes como el cuidado del medio ambiente o hacer el bien en tu vida de una forma ""fantástica"", usando a las criaturas mitológicas para entregar estos mensajes, recuerdo especialmente una escena donde Grover le dice a Percy que solamente un humano no sería un ambientalista, el hecho de que un sátiro haya dicho eso me llegó mucho.

Recomiendo mucho empezar esta saga si aún no lo haz hecho, quizás te pasa como a mi y te llevas una linda sorpresa."
944,945,5,"Review also found here: http://lili-lost-in-a-book.blogspot.c...

Before I read this book I saw the movie. I thought the movie was AWESOME! I had forgotten how much I loved Greek Mythology, even though I’ve never actually studied it. As we were watching the movie my cousin’s girlfriend told me that there were books… I was like “I have to read them!”

So about a week later I picked up this book. I was super excited to read it, and it didn’t let me down. Yes, I know these books are for kids in the middle school age (my 12 year old brother is reading these books too) and I’m 18 years old…But I have to admit, this book had me hooked from start to finish, plus it was an easy read, lol.

Imagine having ADHD and dyslexia… and then later on being told that you don’t have that. That its your battle skills kicking in and that your brain is hardwired to Greek not English. Weird huh? Well not only that, imagine there’s monsters chasing you, one of them captures your mom and you end up in a place called ‘Camp Half-Blood.’ That’s as weird as things can get, right? Wrong!

Well this is exactly what happened to 12 year old Percy Jackson.



After all this information is thrown at Percy, he, Annabeth
, and Grover
set out to find his mom.
But not only that. “It gets worse?” you ask? Well yes, yes it does. It turns out that Zeus’ master bolt is stolen, and guess what… they are blaming Percy for it!
That’s as worse as it can get, right? Wrong! Er… again!
This book is packed with adventures as Percy tries to save his mom and tries to clear his name all at the same time. This is a great read if you’re craving an adventure book, but its also crammed with tons of humor as well. And I have to say, you don’t have to be in middle school to read this book :) lol"
945,946,5,"So I was a little apprehensive when starting the Percy Jackson series because everyone I know who has read it thought it was brilliant. Now I know why! As you can see I have given this book a five and out five stars and this is because it deserves nothing less, it was just awesome!

So we begin our journey with a young boy named Percy Jackson living in New York, he has trouble fitting in at school and puts this down to the fact that he has ADHD and Dyslexia. The story follows Percy through his transition from being at the bottom of the social ladder to discovering he is the son of an Olympian god. Yes that's right, he is the son of Poseidon, god of the sea.

On a school trip to the museum Percy's math teacher transforms into a Fury and tries to kill him and this is when his best friend Grover reveals himself as a Satyr (half goat, half man). Once Percy has come to terms with the fact that he has powers beyond that of a mortal being he starts noticing other things, such as the large amount of monsters that now seem to be after him.

Percy has to leave his home and travel to a place known at Camp Half Blood, where all the children of the gods must go to be trained against the monsters that hunt them, they are Heroes in the making and Percy has now joined them.

Percy then receives a quest and must battle it out with monsters, gods and other unearthly beings to retrieve the Lightning Bolt of Zeus which has been stolen.

The characters in this novel are extremely relatable, as the reader you can appreciate the hardships Percy is having to deal with after discovering his true identity.

The world is built to an impeccable standard, Riordan draws you in with his great depth of knowledge regarding Greek Mythology. All the stories and gods link together so flawlessly and make for an extremely entertaining story.

I would recommend this to anyone of any age, the novel is timeless and even though I'm a 20 year old girl I felt a real connection with Percy, a twelve year old boy!

Keep an eye out for my review of 'The Sea of Monsters', the second in the Percy Jackson series."
946,947,5,"Primera lectura - Abr/May 2019: 5/5⭐️
Relectura - Dic 2021: 4,5/5⭐️

Ayer fue el cumple de mi querido Percy Jackson, entonces quise que el primer post después de mi break sea para homenajearlo🥳 Por Instagram, ustedes eligieron la reseña de Percy Jackson y el Ladrón del Rayo (4,5/5⭐️), así que hoy se las traigo💙

Expulsado de 6 colegios, Percy padece dislexia y dificultades para concentrarse, o al menos ésa es la visión oficial. Un día, los dioses del Olimpo le revelan la verdad: Percy es un semidiós. Y como tal debe descubrir quién ha robado el rayo de Zeus para evitar una guerra entre los dioses. Para cumplir la misión contará con la ayuda de sus nuevos amigos: Grover, un joven sátiro, y Annabeth, hija de Atenea📖

🔱Antes de empezar quería mencionar que esta reseña está hecha desde una relectura, no desde mis primeras impresiones🔱

No podría empezar a hablar de este libro de otra manera que no sea alabando a Percy🫶🏻 Es increíble como narrador! En la mayoría de los libros, me pasa que si hay un único POV lo siento vacío, pero no con esta saga. Percy es lo suficientemente genial como para darme todo lo que quiero y más⚔️

Ya que cubrimos mi amor por Percy, ahora voy con mi crush: Annabeth, y la ternura que me genera Grover. Me había olvidado lo mucho que amaba a estos personajes! Adoro las representaciones de los dioses griegos que propone el Tío Rick (kinda obvious ya q estoy releyéndolos, no?) pero anyways son geniales y merecen que lo recalque🏛

Si tuviera que mencionar un punto en contra, sería que le faltó un poco de Campamento Mestizo para mi gusto. Se largan a la misión muy rápido! También me hubiera gustado conocer a más personajes aparte de Annabeth, Grover y esos hints de Clarisse y Luke. Pero no me quejo porque ya sé que en los próximos está todo ese contenido que tantas ganas tuve de leer en esta entrega📘

El tono de middlegrade me transportó a cuando lo leía mientras merendaba apenas volvía del colegio. El factor nostalgia sumado a la acción y la necesidad de llegar al final hicieron que me lo devorara enseguida! Es una historia hermosa y me pone muy feliz haberme reencontrado con ella❤️‍🩹"
947,948,5,"The first time I read about the misadventures of Percy Jackson, I was in my sixth grade social studies class beginning our unit on Greek mythology. I remember vaguely enjoying it, but certainly not to the extent I had just now. I haven't completely binge-read a book in a while, thanks to the sheer amount of school work I've had to attend to, so I'd almost forgotten how good it feels to just devour a book you've thoroughly enjoyed.

First of all, Percy's narration was GOLD. The wit and sarcasm embezzling the dialogue and pouring into the descriptions was an absolute delight to read. Not to mention the primary and secondary characters both were filled to the brim with personality; I especially loved the haughty Mr. D (Dionysus, the god of wine).

The various ways in which Rick Riordan implemented a multitude of Greek legends into the modern day world was, at times, hilarious, awe-inspiring, and spine-shivering. We get nods to not only the most well-known Greek tales, such as Medusa and the gorgons, but also to more niche stories, like Procrustes and his stretching practices. Riordan fit so many aspects of Greek mythology to fit in with modern circumstances so masterfully, I feel that it's completely plausible for all of this to be happening right under our noses in the present day.
The pacing was excellent; thinking back, so many major revelations, character studies, and battles happened throughout this relatively short novel, that it genuinely feels like I came back from a 600 page fantasy epic. But, nope. It managed to achieve the same effect in half that time. And none of it felt cheap or rushed.

Not to mention the amazing chapter titles; some of them are so weird, but it WORKS.
Example: Chapter 1, I Accidentally Vaporize My Pre-Algebra Teacher. Did it hook you? Of course it did.

All in all, this was immensely enjoyable, even for a middle grade story (don't let that genre label scare you away; I see you, skeptical thirty-year old staring at your computer screen)."
948,949,5,"So this was a reread. It’s the first time I’ve opened the book since I picked it up first five years ago, and honestly I’ve underestimated how much I remember from the books. I thought I’d have forgotten everything. But I remember so much of it it didn’t even feel like it’s been that long!!

It’s just as awesome as I remember, and I know that if this was the first time I read it, I still would have adored it ♥️"
949,950,5,"I had a hard time picking this one up. I'm not much for mixing myths and fantasy. But this series really grabbed me. I dragged my kids to the library the day after I finished this to get the next one - Sea of Monsters - which I finished that day. I have Titan's Curse on order. 9/1/07

Reread this for my children's bookclub. We discuss it 11/8/12. I'll try to update then.

It was very popular, 8+7

A fantastic, fun meeting. Everyone was able to create their own demigod while we gathered. (A few were Percy Jr, Xanna, Electra, Lilly) We had a great game that tested our knowledge of the gods. (She made cards that had 1 trait and a god's name. So someone starts by asking who has the God of (Good luck & Fortune). Several of us needed hints, but it was such a success we played it twice. Questions about the story were then passed around. A question was read and then the reader could answer or call on others. Jana read a couple reviews of Lightning Thief and we discussed which was better, and what makes for a better review.

What are the things to remember when writing a great book review?
A. Make sure to start with the book's title, author, and illustrator(if there is one).
B. Give a brief summary of the plot that doesn't give away too much.
C. Comments on the book's strengths and weaknesses.
D. Give your personal opinions about the book with specific examples to support praise or criticism.
E. Share your review with others. If anyone is comfortable we can post them on the library web page or in the children's room. Online possibilities are or

People were also able to vote for their favorite book from the book club for the year. We could have a run-off. The results were:

Invention of Hugo Cabret & Lightning Thief each with 3
Sideways Stories of Wayside School received 2
Extraordinary Adventures of Ordinary Basil, Half Magic & Widow's Broom each got 1 vote."
950,951,5,"The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan is narrated by a funny, twelve year old boy named Percy Jackson. The story starts off in Manhattan, New York and Percy gets kicked out of his school... again. He lives with his mother and his awful, stinky step-father, Gabe, in a tiny apartment.

When Percy Jackson gets attacked on a school field trip by a monster, his mother and Grover, his best friend, take him to Camp Half-Blood. On the way, they get attacked by a Minotaur and Percy's mother is captured. Percy then finds out that he is a Demigod; half god, half mortal. After finding out what he is and what he can do, he sets off to go rescue his mother with Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena, and Grover, a sytar. Percy meets gods, monsters and many challenges on his quest and most of the time he's fighting for his own life.

Just because this book and series is classified as children books doesn't mean it is not any good or only for children. I read this book in fifth grade and absolutely loved it and still love it. All the characters are well thought out and hilarious and I enjoyed reading about them and how they progress thought the book and series. Riordan's message from the very beginning and throughout was that anybody can be amazing and do extraordinary things. This was interesting to read about because Riordan tells us this through Percy. In the beginning he said he was nobody and then he turned out to be a demigod fighting monsters!

I learned a lot about Greek Mythology and all the gods and the myths about them. This book teaches you without you knowing it. I recommend this book(and the series) to anyone who wants a light, funny, action packed book to read. This book hooked me on the very first page and that rarely ever happens. I hope you read it and enjoy it as much as I have!"
951,952,5,"It’s such a spectacular novel that opens up a mythological world!! My umpteenth time rereading this classic and it still gets me excited each time. It’s honestly just as satisfying to read even when you know how the story plays out because you notice all the small details that possibly foreshadowed the rest of the series!

Uncle Rick knows how to write adventures, that’s for sure. Each turn, there’s always something amiss, so it’s never a dull moment!

My particularly favorite feat is the way Uncle Rick acknowledges other religions but doesn’t write them off. Like when the group saw a preacher in the Underworld and Percy considered how that would be, if he believed in a different afterlife. And then Grover comes in and says “who says he’s seeing this place the way we’re seeing it?” Iconic.

These three, I hold near and dear to my heart. Their friendship and their trust grows exponentially and it was so refreshing to see it play out from the beginning again!

Comments:
- Percy’s family/mom would be more financially stable if she didn’t live in Manhattan and had sent him to a fancy boarding school.
- Sally’s patience is on a whole different playing field. She’d never raised her voice at her 12 year old, troublesome son? Unbeatable.
- Would’ve been a more fitting detail if green was Sally & Percy’s favorite food color instead of blue
- Percy acknowledges and starts to normalize Greek gods at this point. He finds girls waving at him from the bottom of the lake, doesn’t think that’s strange but feigns at the idea that those girls are Naiads?
- so who did the The Fates kill?
- What happens if Percy loses his pen cap?
- I imagine Ares to look like Hulk Hogan
- Get Annabeth Sims 4 right now!!
- I wonder how Sally “properly disposed” Medusa’s head."
952,953,5,"I FORGOT HOW MUCH I LOVED THIS SERIES OMG!!

I haven't read this series in such a long time, so rereading this was such a nostalgic experience for me! I was also rereading this while spending my day waiting round in a hospital, so it made the time pass so much quicker!

I just loved all the characters in this book (except maybe a certain few..) because they all had really unique personalities but they all had such a good dynamic together (again, except certain characters..). I loved the group dynamic between Percy, Grover and Annabeth and how they all worked together to save each other, and they wouldn't leave any of the others behind. They started off not all liking each other and getting along, but throughout the book they bonded and became really good friends which I loved!

I also really liked how Rick Riordan blended the world of Greek mythology with our world and today's civilization. I thought it all worked so well together! I love Greek mythology even more after reading this, because you learn about new gods and new monsters in each chapter, and you get their backstory in such a well written, non boring way which just makes me love Rick Riordan's writing even more!

I really enjoyed how funny the characters are and I even found myself laughing out loud a few times during the book! Rick Riordan just has a really satirical writing style, and he makes fun of things in a way that doesn't even make them offensive! I love how he used comedic comparisons, making everything so much funnier, and all of Percy's little side comments and descriptions he makes in his head are hilarious!

He really is an amazing writer and I'm so excited to start the next book in the series!"

Dopo anni dalla pubblicazione di questa saga finalmente mi approccio anche io alla lettura di Percy Jackson, e devo dire che tutte le mie aspettative sono state ampiamente soddisfatte!

Percy Jackson è un normale ragazzino di 12 anni, o meglio, normale per quanto possa esserlo un ragazzino che ogni anno, per cause diverse, si ritrova a dover cambiare scuola. Ma la sua vita subisce una grande svolta quando, durante una visita a un museo, la sua insegnante di matematica si tramuta in una Furia, e Percy la fa a pezzi con una spada magica sotto le spoglie di una comunissima penna. Non è un sogno, né tantomeno un’allucinazione, perché Percy non è affatto un ragazzo normale: è un mezzosangue, e il padre che non ha mai conosciuto è Poseidone, il dio del mare.

Già, perché gli dei dell’Olimpo non si sono affatto trasformati in un cumulo di anticaglie, e non sono solo affascinanti miti da studiare sui banchi di scuola: si sono semplicemente trasferiti in America.

Per un’appassionata di mitologia greca come me, questo libro non poteva che risultare irresistibile. Ironico, meravigliosamente scorrevole, oltre a deliziare i lettori con rimandi alla storia classica “rimodernati” dal gusto di Riordan gli regala anche plot twist e un fantastico trio di protagonisti (che in più punti ammicca al celebre Golden Trio di Harry Potter, ma sinceramente chi se ne frega): Percy, Annabeth e Grover entrano all’istante nei cuori dei lettori. Trovo che siano personaggi con cui è facile entrare in sintonia.

Insomma, oltre a rendermi consapevole delle mie origini divine (sono un’orgogliosa figlia di Ade 😎🖤) la lettura di questo libro mi ha regalato l’inizio una saga meravigliosa che sarò felicissima di portare a termine!"
955,956,5,"If you like books filled with adventure and Greek mythology, you have to read The Lightning Thief.

Percy Jackson is a twelve years old boy who has been expelled from a couple of schools and can't concentrate. Everybody thinks he's a failure, except his mother. So it isn't exactly surprising that he has only one friend and his school and a teacher hates him. What he wasn't expecting was that her teacher became a monster and tried to kill him.

Nobody seems to remind that little detail, but he's sure he isn't crazy. But Percy's past is full of secrets, and his mother has tried to protect him until now.


Percy's voices trapped me from the beginning. He's young, but extremely fun and mature, and innocent. When he discovers he's a demigod, things starts to get complicated. First, nobody knows who is his father and now he's being accused of stealing Zeus lightning bolt.

That's why he, and his friends Grover and Annabeth decides to discovers who is the real thief and that way stop a war between gods. But of course, the Gods have never been very fair and some of them wants Percy to be guilty.

Their journey is so much fun. Full of adventures and dangers, there were always twists that managed to surprise me.

The writing is simple and with Percy's voice, I read it very quickly. It was never boring or too intense, and I always wanted to read more.

Overall, The Lightning Thief is a story with Greek mythology interlaced with the modern world that I loved, and I regret I didn't read it when I was younger. I'm definitely going to read more of the Percy Jackson's books, I believe it's going to be one of my favorite series!"
956,957,5,"If not for this series, I wouldn't have two bookshelves in my room. I wouldn't feel some sort of special connection to book stores and libraries, smiling as I pass the books that enhanced my imagination since I started taking the time to actually read for me and not for requirements. Heck, I wouldn't even be on this platform if I hadn't read this series.

Percy Jackson and the Olympians had me chattering on and on about books, made me excited about release dates, and caused me to create makeshift stacks and shelves until my collection came to be so much that I required more room. I made a fan account (which doesn't exist anymore, thank the gods), wrote fanfiction (with the expertise of a ten-year-old, so it wasn't that great haha), and dreamed of the day when I would get the chance to create something as amazing as these books.

Percy's journey is extraordinarily written. In fact, I find it even more entertaining now that I am older and am able to truly appreciate the thought that goes into Rick Riordan's world-building and characterization. After months of having a hard time reading, just the first page of this one caused me to dive into the adventure ahead. It's like I've entered Lotus Hotel and Casino, becoming so immersed in the grand energy of it all that I can't help but read more and more and more and more...

I could gush about this book for thousands of more words, but I kinda wanna go now...so I can continue reading the third book in the series!"
957,958,5,"I honestly don't know how to review this amazing masterpiece. Percy Jackson series are by far the most underrated awesome hilarious packed with friendship and love and adrenaline gushing adventures. It's sad that in my place most don't know how awesome Percy Jackson series are and how they're missing out a great chunk of awesomeness.
To me, Percy Jackson is everything. Uncle Rick literally saved my life through Percy and Percy would always, always be my most beloved person from ughh fictional world.
Now about the book, it's unputdownable. Rick Riordan is one of the sassiest and hilarious writers and the narration he unleashes through the first person perspective of Percy Jackson, a 12 years old kid with dyslexia and ADHD with a troubled family. Percy has a different destiny which he hadn't even expected. He grew up believing that he was just a random kid but little did he know how important he is to the world (and to me too).
Do *not* ignore this book assuming it as a children book because PJO series along with rest of the books in Riordanverse have a lot to teach one about humanity than schools do. These books made me feel at home, gave me a safe haven and shaped my thoughts and perspective.
The writing is gripping and the adventures are bone chilling. Plus, you could learn a great deal of stuff about Greek gods and goddesses too! What's more, you can have a good laugh reading Percy's narration of what happens.
Percy Jackson is the sassiest character of all and he's someone you'd end up calling your bestfriend."
958,959,5,"This is the book that made me realize that the phrase ""Reading is dreaming with your eyes open."" is definitely true.

I'm a huge fan of Rick Riordan since the beginning of time. The adventures with the Demigods are really vivid and this is where I get to channel my inner child imagination and dreams at. Yes, I'm still a little kid at heart.

The plot is wonderful and very creative. The characters, especially Percy, are very likeable. There’s so much humor and the twists keep appearing at places where I least expect them to. I absolutely enjoyed the whole journey.

Luke Castellan. He's so badass and mysterious. Well, I have a huge crush on Percy too! Styx,

Demigods mostly have dyslexia and ADHD and I think that the idea is great. It's like your imperfections make you special and you have nothing to be afraid of. This book () inspired me to like Greek mythology more.

does not contain any dry pages. I assure you that."
959,960,5,"There's not enough room in my heart for all of the love I have for Percy Jackson.

Edit 11/2023: The day I don't enjoy reading Percy Jackson is the day my soul has died.

Everything about this series is just so magical to me, and it is astounding to me that this first book holds up so dam well.
As I sit here and try to form any coherent sort of review, I keep getting stuck on the fact that Rick has been writing this world and these characters for 18 years. When I read Chalice of the Gods, I definitely felt all the nostalgia and ties to this og series, but going straight from that to the very beginning really made me realize that Rick never missed a beat with these books. Percy's voice has always been so distinct, and I'm sure that's something he worked hard to master when writing this first book, but it is just so amazing to me that every single thing between this very first book written in 2005 and the books coming out in 2023 holds up. I don't know how to express these thoughts any clearer, but I just think that's really cool.

Anyways, I love being in Percy's head as he navigates the not-so-mythical world alongside his little found family. And I also love that everytime I read this book, I notice something new about how perfect the Lightning Thief musical is. They didn't have to go as hard as they did with everything from the characters to the straight-off-the-page dialogue, but I sure do appreciate the fact that they did."
960,961,5,"This is a good fastpaced read which will really endulge you in the story. At times it is silly, but sometimes that's all you want from a book. The Lightning Thief does have more to offer. I'd say it's on par with the Harry Potter series and that it has some similarities with the world famous book. The three main characters in this book aren't quite carbon copies of THE golden trio, but they are very similair to Harry, Hermione and Ron. This didn't bother me at all but it was very curious. Did Rick Riordan use the formula because it is so succesful or was it not intentional? Don't get me wrong, I'm not calling him a copycat. Every writer 'steals' ideas: it's called inspiration. Of course J.K Rowling did the same with her books. I remember picking up somewhere that Hermoine is slightly based on Athena (which would explain the uncanny similarities between her and Annabeth). Do I remember this correctly?

Rick Riordan is a master of adapting century old stories and making them his own. He never disrespects the guidelines that the original myths have, but he crafts his own world using them. I've thought about why I can't give this book five stars, but I haven't been able to put it in words yet. It's really good but not perfect. Maybe I would have liked the conflicts to go a little deeper or the characters to be a little more original. Then again: bonuspoints for Percy's humour!"

4.5/5
Okay, lots of things to say here....
PREFACE: NO FULL REVIEW ON BLOG FOR SINGULAR BOOKS - WILL MASS REVEW THE SERIES

1) In my first read, I was a stubborn teenage asshole who did not want to like what other people liked. Beyond that, I had just gotten into YA and was really sick of the younger reader book tropes. I think this was a wrong book wrong time situation.
2) Damn, Riordan knows how to write a young reader book. It reads so clearly, yet is still knowledgeable in teaching about Greek Gods and even dropping a nice scrabble word every now and then.
3) I used to not be a Greek God person. Now I must know what happens. (No, I never got spoiled for these. Please don't spoil me)
4) THEY WERE SO RIGHT WITH THE MOVIE RUINED THIS.
5) Knocked half a star because the end felt a little anticlimactic beyond the whole (spoiler?) Luke thing. I was kind of waiting for something more. This could also be because I'm super familiar with the story of the first book, having seen the bad movie once or twice and read the book before.
6) These books do such a good job of balancing dramatic things but also being an escape from the crazy world around us.

So pumped to read the rest of this series before it's remade for Disney+.



FIRST READ 2013:
Wasn’t my favorite thing, contrary to popular belief"
962,963,5,"An Amazing Book about Gods, Demigods, Humans- Now a days..

So, this boy Percy Jackson is a child with ADHD and Dyslexia. Letters dance infront of his eyes!

How much ever he tries to be good, something or the other goes wrong. He's been changed from school every year!

And now, Ugh! There is an Evil teacher, a very nervous, nice boy as friend, whom he always wants to protect from other mean children!

But, here's the twist! His friend is NOT a human at all! The evil teacher is also NOT a human!

His evil teacher is a monster!!! And his favourite Teacher gave him a pen to fight his evil Maths teacher.. which was a sword in disguise of a pen! He killed his teacher! Or rather... Evaporated her!

He's in a deadly situation immediately when he leaves his school! Followed by most dangerous beasts, losing his mom, etc!

How horrible for a young boy like him, right?

Read the book to unfold all his misteries! ;)


This is an amazing, tale of friendship, bravery, deciet, magic and Gods!! (Greek Gods).




Somehow, I couldn't rate it 5 stars. But, it is a thorough 4 star book! Awesome plot, Awesome writing, Cool adventure!

Edit: I can't justify 4 stars now that I have read this book atleast 5 times! I've read most of Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus series multiple times! Rick is by far my favourite author!"
963,964,5,"[5]

Okay, here we go ...

I loved this book so much, I have to admit that I have never read a book of Greek mythology in my life, I think that's why I liked it so much. I've never read a Rick Riordan book, and now that I've read one of his books, I want to put him in the top two of my favorites authors because I love the way he writes and describes the characters, I just want to say that I loved this book and I think I will have it forever in my heart. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰"
964,965,5,Everything about this series is so good man...
965,966,5,"Hail, Perseus Jackson, Son of the Sea God.

Where do I begin explaining my love for the Percy Jackson series? With the relatable and absolutely delightful characters? With the admirable way Rick Riordan handles the Greek mythology? With the great plot?

That book has it all for me. Family matters, friendship, quests and monsters. Even though it was written for a Middle Grade audiance, it doesn’t read nor feel Middle Grade (after I’m 21 and this is one of my favorite series). The plot is so well crafted, with little plot twists along the way. The big reveal at the end makes it a perfect ending for it open a lot of future possibilities.

The characters. By the gods, they are near to perfect. It has become my life goal to attain Percy’s sass. Annabeth is a QUEEN. She is so wise and intelligent and funny and witty. I am happy younger girls have a female character such as her in their books. Annabeth isn’t really describe physically, and Riordan didn’t make a priority of her appearance, focusing on her other traits.

First review : Unfortunately I had watched the movies before reading the books. But imagine my surprise when I discovered the plot was so different and way more elaborated in the books!"
966,967,5,"Upon reread as an adult, I think it has to be 5 stars.

If this wasn’t a reread of the book that got me into reading, the first book I ever loved with my whole heart, then maybe my feelings would be a bit more lukewarm. But I’m just so dang grateful to this book and as I read it I relived reading it as a child, just a little bit. I’d recite these words every single day as a pastime after coming home from school at age 10, trying to fall into the roles of Annabeth, Percy, whatever. Annabeth (and Suki from atla) also changed the game for me when it came to what girls could do and be. Nostalgia makes this book 5 stars where I might’ve given it lower had this been my first reading.

But also I think this book just holds up. The pacing and humor, in my opinion, are flawless. Percy is such a great character with such great supporting casts. The quest is fun and fast, exactly as a middle grade plot should be. I can’t wait to move onto the next one because, as a kid, I loved SoM and thought every book got better than the last.

I want to end this review with one of my favorite lines, that I think describes pjo fans quite accurately:

“What belongs to the sea will always return to the sea.”"
967,968,5,"pierwszy raz - 4⭐️

968,969,5,"Unexpectedly 5 stars.
At first I was reluctant to start this series even though it was on my TR list for awhile. Asa fan of the Greek Mythology and Harry Potter, and after watching the movies of this series, I was afraid that I would not like it that much, as I did not like very much the movies. As well as O thought that the middle grade book will not be as exciting for me. However I loved it. I did not get disappointed, but I would love to see more of the gods if possible in the next books.

I liked the characters, they were kind of like the main 3 of HP characters, Like Ron afraid but determined, like Harry destined and like Hermione smart. However I loved them anyway despite the similarity. But I expect them to grow to something different by the time.

I loved the quest part. How they went after it. It was more interesting and adventurous than in movie(thumbs up to that).

Although Annabeth sometimes annoyed me she and Luke had it hard, well in her case at least she found a light in this world.

And all this because Zeus could not keep it in his pants. As always. Never liked him... Poor Hades lol

Loved it anyway!!!"
969,970,5,"Truly enchanted by the idea of the novel. Seriously, the PJ series is going to be my favourite so far.
Well, frankly speaking, at the beginng I had a constant nagging feeling I was expecting some more.. fun. The culprit is the movie, which is damn good,of course, despite some distinctly inaccurate interpretations.But the more I read, the more I got involved. I mean, there were some things in the book I'd prefer to see happening the other way, but I think it only signifies the degree of being into it.
The event I was looking forward to most of all? Capture of the flag, surely. Was not disappointed.
The character I WAS disappointed about? Grover. Well, at first, anyway. Seemed bit sulky compared to his movie-self. Turned out to be quite a goat boy, actually.
The most charming character? Have a guess!
Luke did cost me some grinded teeth, that's for sure. Bit unexpected, though.
Ares - quite a bloke! Made an impression.
That parcel sent to the mountain? The boy had some guts!
Not for children only. For adult children, too. Those who are always young at heart."
970,971,5,"[Re-read] Bueno, opino lo mismo que la primera vez que lo leí porque amo esta saga con todo mi corazoncito JAKDKJHD solo quiero agregar que me pego más fuerte la amistad entre Percy, Annabeth y Grover. Básicamente porque en la segunda saga no he visto mucho de ellos por ahora.
Dato: lo releí solo porque le presté el libro al profe Diego y no quería que viera nada raro en mis anotaciones así que era para asegurarme de eso KSDJKSDALL aún no me devuelve el libro 😿

Lo primero que pensé al abrir el libro fue: amo los títulos.
La primera página me enganchó enseguida y cuando dice el icónico: “mira, yo no quería ser mestizo”, supe que Percy se iba a convertir en mi próximo comfort character… Y NO ME EQUIVOQUÉ (ahora es el amor de mi vida 💐).

Amé como se refuerza el vínculo de amistad entre Percy, Grover y Annabeth… son tan lindos 😭💕💘💖💓 encima se lee rápido y es re divertido, yo me reía bastante jeje

Necesito la adaptación de la serie porque al terminar el libro fui directamente a ver la película… ese fue un error porque pasé enojada desde el minuto 1 hasta que termina.
Logan Lerman es un muy buen Percy… right person, wrong time 💔"
971,972,5,"This book was bottled nostalgia and I wanted to drink from it every second of every day. Of course, I doubted Rick would disappoint me but I didn't expect to enjoy it this much. I, a college-level student, greatly enjoyed a book marketed for tweens and I am unashamed.

Percy (the MC) was everything 12-year-old (and present-day) me craved in a main character. He was funny, mildly dim but also clever. The characters in the book were dynamic and relatable. The highlight is that each of the main trio could be labelled a 'comedic relief character' and I lived for that. The evolution of Percy and Annabeth's relationship was nearly more entertaining to read than the plot! Despite all that, Grover stole my heart and was handed the favourite character medallion 🏅

The pacing was also immaculate. There was no point in the 9+ hour audiobook where I felt bored. The plot was interesting and I never felt lost from not knowing a specific Greek myth as everything was explained at some point to the reader (without massive info dumps).

Rick you have made my inner child very very happy today, well done.

Bookstagram:"
972,973,5,"Percy Jackson will always have my heart. When I was in 5th grade, my brother really wanted me to read this book, I didn't want to but finally after a lot of convincing, I read it in 6th grade. TO this day when I'm reading it, I still laugh because Percy's narrating is hilarious. I also like it because I relate to Annabeth's character. Rick Riordan does a good job of slowing going into each characters background and seeing how it shapes them to who they are today. The plot of the book moves along well and is very engaging. The lightning thief does a good job setting the foundation for a very lovable series, and I will continue to reread these books until I die.

Update: it’s really annoying how Goodreads doesn’t classify a book in a different language as a separate book but I just finished reading the French version of this book, and it was great! This one had more unfamiliar vocab because there’s a lot of Greek mythology and stuff. It was really good French practice, it also helped that I know the book so well so it was easier to understand the French haha, still such a good book :)"
973,974,5,"So, I've been quietly rereading this book along a chapter-by-chapter podcast I've been listening to and it's been a ride.

I still love The Lightning Thief too pieces. I love the writing, the wit, the overall humor, the excitement, the heart, the Greek mythology and of course the characters.

I fell in love with the series when I wasn't in a really good place and these books and characters offered me a form of escapism and comfort I couldn't find anywhere else at the time and rereading these books takes me back to that place.

Sometimes you reread (or re-watch) something and your enthusiasm for it slowly falters because you see it with a more critical eye now, and why I can acknowledge that some parts of the book are very early 2000s, there's even more I appreciate now.

These books are truly a treasure to hold and deserves all the love they are getting and even more."
974,975,5,"Rick Riordan is a comical genius whose books I adore! I decided to read this book after seeing the Percy Jackson movie and being told by a friend of mine how unlike the novel is was. So I picked up the book and began reading it. And of course, my friend was right. While the movie was indeed amazing, the novel was even better!

Percy Jackson, Annabeth and Grover are three lovable characters with interesting quirks and flaws. Following them on their journey was a pleasure that kept me hooked at all times. There wasn't much wrong with this novel (other than I wish it was centered more in the YA universe so it could deal with other problems, but that's not an issue more than it is a wish of mine).

The book has amazing twists and turns, as well as good action sequences and character development. I can't wait to continue reading this author's work! Amazing!

Five out of five stars! I'm addicted to this series now!"
975,976,5,"I feel as deeply invested as I should have when I was in elementary and middle school. Time to buy the rest of the series and read them again too! (I borrowed the rest from my 6th grade teacher, bless her).

But anyway...wow I loved this so much this time around. I can't believe I ever disliked it. Honestly the only flaws in my mind are the unbelievability of the adults (the cops would never let 12 yr olds fly alone on a plane after being kidnapped, sorry, and I have to think that they would be chaperoned on their quests, not just sent into the wilderness to fend for themselves) and how Percy didn't really seem 12 (maybe more like 14 or 15). But honestly? I'm so in love with this concept, this world, this book, and Rick's writing (which I used to hate? weird?)

Wish I could go back to middle school, shake myself, and tell her that she could love this book so much more.

But that's the past, I guess. Better late than never, right?"
976,977,5,"¿Porque no lo habré leido antes? Me encanta y estoy segura y se quedará en mi corazón por muchísimo tiempo y siento que si lo hubiese leído hace algunos añitos me hubiera fascinado aún más porque ya hasta altura Vi las películas y tengo alguno que otro spoiler pero eso no intervino para que amara a este libro, nos basamos en la mitología griega que ya con eso tiene todas de ganar, y más aparte el personaje es muy bueno, ni es indefenso o inseguro ni tampoco se cree tan valiente, es muy osado y para la edad en que lo plantean que son 12 años es muy maduro, muy inteligente y muy astuto es de los pocos personajes que al leerlo no me estresan, que desde los primeros capítulos me atrapó la forma de humor que tiene el escritor es cómica pero sin que llegue a plantearlo así tal cual de broma, adoro lo sarcástico de Percy y cada capítulo con Grover era súper cute, me encantó lo termine en dos días y no puedo esperar a conocer más de la historia 💙"
977,978,5,"I remember deeply loving these books when reading them as a child, and they still are quite good. They don't age the same way Harry Potter books do in that in the first few books I was struck by how ~immature~ they were as 11 year olds. Percy, on the other hand, probably hasn't even reached puberty and still manages to do one of the most adult things I've ever seen: planning a 7 day west coast trip with 2 friends that he actually goes through with and has almost no anxiety about.
There's a lot to like about this book. The characters are likeable and I really like Rick Riordan's ""cool English Teacher"" style where he makes writing ""fun"" by having jokes on each chapter name, or referencing things that are hip. As an adult it really screams that hey fellow kids Steve Buscemi meme, but it's still really cool how he managed to make kids obsessed with greek mythology
5 stars because if there's anything I like to see in books it's the mentioning of the Upper East Side."
978,979,5,"Recién a mis 19 años leí esto... Y yo me pregunto ¿POR QUÉ?, mí yo de 12-13 lo hubiera amado definitivamente. Ni idea por qué nunca le di una oportunidad antes, pero ahora vi la oportunidad de leerlo en una lectura conjunta y BOOM, mi mundo acaba de ampliarse y llenarse de información sobre dioses y mitología.

¿Qué decir del libro? Lo amé, lo leí muy rápido porque encuentro que es una lectura muy ligera y entretenida, lo empecé a leer y no me pude despegar del libro porque pasaban tantas cosas, que necesitaba saber qué era lo siguiente que iba a pasar en esta aventura. Me encanta la forma de narrar de Percy, la personalidad de los personajes, la historia.

En especial me gusta mucho el cómo se aborda el TDAH y la Dislexia, mencionandolo como algo que los distingue como semidioses, algo importante. Me gusta la idea de que niños y jóvenes puedan sentirse identificados con estos personajes.

Lo recomiendo completamente, para cualquier edad."
979,980,5,How does one even write a review of this literature masterpiece.
980,981,5,"9/23/18
I first read this book in sixth grade and it has inspired me to take up fencing (closest thing to sword-fighting I could find) and learn Ancient Greek in college. Needless to say, it has been a huge part of my life. I have been apprehensive of re-reading it because I was worried the writing would be overly simplified and overall, the book would be a disappointment compared to when I read it as a sixth grader. I could not be more wrong. I found myself immediately entranced with the world once again. I immediately fell in love with the characters and the dialogue and relationships between them. There are so many one-liners of pure gold between Annabeth and Percy specifically. Re-reading this book made me excited to do my Greek homework again. There were also bits of Ancient Greek interspersed within the book, some of which I could actually read which was really cool."
981,982,5,"Holy crap! Holy crap! Holy crap!
This was magnificent! The writing, the Greek mythology, the characters and the world just absolutely stunning.

I cannot believe it has taken me so long to read these amazing books but I'm glad I did. Hello new fandom world <3

This book follows a 12 year old boy named Percy Jackson who has been diagnosed with adhd and dyslexia who also been expelled from several schools. He was sent to a boarding school and has a friend named Grover and one day his teacher on a field trip corners him and turns into a monster. Percy defeats the teacher thanks to another ""teacher"" and discovers the half blood camp. Thus the introduction to him being half God half human.

The way this story is set up and told is truly amazing and I've learnt more about Greek mythology in this book than at school. Thanks Rick Riordan I can't wait to read more!!"
982,983,5,"*4.5*
Unique world, gripping plot, hilarious characters and mind blowing events, all in one book.

I'm so glad I finally picked up the Percy Jackson series, it's not just the great time I spent reading it but the enormous amount of information that I gained just by reading it. All the knowledge about the Greek Gods and the myths that were perfectly executed to match the story.

Probably one of the best cast of characters ever, Percy, Grover, Annabeth and Chiron. Each character has its own individual characteristics and their own battle to fight.

As for someone who knows nothing about Greek gods, Rick Riordan did such an amazing job to explain everything and not in an annoying way that you'll get bored, on the contrary his writing style was one of the best elements that added a lot to the epic storyline."
983,984,5,"10 stars- can I do that?😂
I might publish a more complete review later but for now here it is. Hand. Down. Favorite. Series. I've never met anyone who dislikes the series (with the rare exception of those who watched the movies first and refused to read the books). I started reading these books in fourth grade. Years later I still love them with all my heart. PJO is one of those books where no matter how many times you read them, you still get something out of it. Every single book has something new to give. But if your wondering about this individual book... it's amazing. The Lightning Thief is fast paced in all the right places, with plenty of Rick Riordan trademark humor, and wonderful chapter names. I'd recommend for people of all ages, whether you like mythology or not. Please read... Percy Jackson will literally change your life."
984,985,5,"Well, for some reason when I was in middle school I never read these books when all of my other friends did. Maybe it was because I had a tendency to dislike popular fiction and really enjoyed classics at that age, I don't know. Anyways I decided that I should know why they were so popular and so I decided to finally read them now, at the age of sixteen. I'm very glad that I did. So far I have only read this one, the first one, but I plan on reading the rest of the Percy Jackson books, and Rick Riordan books as well, hopefully. Percy Jackson is a very likeable character and he is a great protagonist. I did not feel like these books were childish in any way, except that the writing is fairly simple. I really enjoyed the story, and it had a couple of good plot twists. It was a very fun book and I can't wait to read the next one!"
985,986,5,"First, I'm so disappointed with myself for not reading this book sooner!
I should've read this before watching the movie years ago.

But despite of that, this book gave me the chills with every words I've read. Not the scary type of chills but the chills you experience when you're feeling excited or having fun. This book really is fun and very very interesting!

Proof is, I've told myself the line ""Just one more chapter"" many times as I flipped the pages of this book during the middle of the night.

Word of advice: Do not read this book in the middle of the night especially when you have to wake up early the next day!
I was ALMOST tempted to file a leave at work just so I can finish reading this book. Haha.

Did I already said that I had so much fun reading this book? Yes? Then sorry not sorry, but this is a VERY GOOD BOOK! I can't wait to start on the next book 😍"
986,987,5,
987,988,5,"Hooray for Percy Jackson! This is a totally fun book. I love that it is so modern. Percy (the main character) is an 11 year-old boy who gets into trouble at every turn, doesn't do well in school, is dyslexic, has ADHD, but of course at heart he's a good kid with a surprisingly strong ability to understand Greek mythology. Naturally he ends up in the middle of the gods fighting about Zeus's master lightning bolt which has been stolen as Percy is the lead suspect in the theft. This is not your mother's Greek mythology! I love picturing Zeus in a pinstripe suit, Poseidon dressed as a beachcomber and Ares as a biker dude complete with muscle shirt and duster. Yes it hearkens to Harry Potter, and it's not quite as good as Harry Potter, but it is still really fun and entertaining."
988,989,5,"I love this book! Comparing this to the movie adaptation, some parts were missing and those parts should be included in the movie (too bad it's not). I'm looking forward to the next book, this series is recommended for all ages. Very exciting and because of this, I'm hooked in Greek Mythology and I want to read more about it. :)

Somehow I find Percy annoying, he's naive at times and somehow stubborn. The good thing about him is that he's brave and caring. I admire him that he's willing to sacrifice himself for his mom. But anyways, though I've watched the movie first before reading.. i feel bad about the movie. I haven't seen Ares. :| and Percy is 12 years old :P . If they are going to make the next movie.. I hope it's better than the first one ;)"
989,990,5,"El Ladro del Rayo es un libro que realmente me sorprendió, no esperaba mucho de este libro pero la verdad es que me encantó desde principio a fin. Lo mejor del libro es sin duda son los personajes, están tan bien pensados y son tan divertidos. Percy Jackson es un increíble narrador, cada cosa que decía me sacó una sonrisa. Otra de cosa que me encantó fue que realmente aprendí acerca de la mitología y seres mitológicos. Aunque el libro sea corto me mantuvo entretenida y no lo pude soltar hasta que lo termine!.También me encantaron los nombres de lolos capítulos!.
Lo único negativo que le puedo encontrar es que es un poco infantil, me hubiera encantado leerlo à los 12 años, igual me encantó y definitivamente voy a seguir leyendo esta saga!."
990,991,5,rereading it for the first time in forever and i still love it as much as i did the first time! mainly because i forgot plots and details easily though so they get to surprise me all over again. but yeah growing up with this series was one of my fondest childhood memories and it has been such a comfort blanket for me like i'm not even kidding i listen to the tlt musical tracks at least once a week and there's been a time in my life where i listen to it on my way to uni every morning. words just can't describe the love i have for this whole series and i hope i get to see the musical someday or maybe we get a full ass franchise that does the series justice idk just bring some respect to my man Percy's name ... you know?
991,992,5,"“Even strength must bow to wisdom sometimes.”

A friend of mine told me once when I started reading this that the movies were cheesy and of course it was hard to believe that since I WAS a big fan.

Now after finishing the first book I can say that the movies are soooo cheesy.

The Characters are different in tempers, looks, even ages.
Believe me, you need to read the books only and nothing else.

It is well written and the characters are amazing with a lot of sense of humor. The ending was really good and I loved it. I can't believe that it took me that long to read this book.

Can't wait to finish all the books."
992,993,5,"Do I even have to say it? this is like the best book ever and I cannot stop rereading and I really want to say this is my fav book but gods I love them all and I know once I reread battle of the labyrinth I'll be saying the same and the last olympian has me on a chokehold

Literally cannot wait for the tv show and the cast so far it's perfect I love them all so much already cannot wait to see all of these scenes DISNEY YOU BETTER MAKE IT WORTH THE WAIT

September 2023 reread: still one of the best books I've ever read, it might be the nostalgia speaking but also no, the percy jackson series is amazing and after getting the teaser for the tv show I couldn't help myself and had to reread for like the millionth time THAT'S HOW GOOD IT IS"
993,994,5,"May 25th...
The time has (finally) come - let's see what all the hype is about...

May 28th...
That has been a surprisingly satisfying read; a great YA novel, filled with ancient Greek legends, exciting action-packed twists and turns, and a moral lesson on the bravery and meaning of true friends and the importance and love of family in one's life.
Also, I was constantly comparing the novel to the movie, and may I say, the first is undobtedly a hundred times better than the second one (Duuh)! But I'm still happy on watching the movie first, since I knew where the story was going, but I was, at the same time, constantly surprised by the differences!"
994,995,5,"This was an amazing read. I first read this book in 2013, and I loved it. I am glad to say that I still love this book. This was the second series that got me back into reading. The first being Divergent trilogy. I really loved the character development and the friendships that Percy made along his journey. I think this book was amazing because of how character based it was in my opinion. Percy Jackson's character goes on a journey and it was great to see it unfold before my eyes. There was some sad moments, and there was the plor twist that made this book worth a 5 star rating. I can't wait to re-read the other books in the series. Overall, an incredible read."
995,996,5,"I read this book in my childhood; around the age of 11. I instantly fell in love with the author's work in Greek Mythology and continued on with the rest of his series. I have grown out of the children books now, but when I was younger they were my very favorite. The characters were unique and all had something relatable about them that you just connected to the situations throughout the story. The different settings throughout the story brought the imagery to life and it was definitly one of those books I read with a flashlight under my covers when I was supposed to be sleeping! (Teehee) Don't tell my mother ;)"
996,997,5,This series will always hold a very special place in my heart. I first read this series in elementary school and fell in love with the world and characters wholeheartedly. Flash forward to now I am in college and I have read my fair share of books. I figured that given the horrid things happening in the world right now I could use something that made me smile. I am happy to say that I enjoyed this just as much as I did the first time. Possibly more. I love this series and these characters and I hope that for the sake of my inner camp half-blood loving child that Rick never stops writing books.
997,998,5,"January 2023: celebrating the year of percy jackson and the olympians book 6 by rereading the entire series


May 2020: Finally finally got myself the illustrated edition this was so wholesome such a wild ride i’m thriving. the drawings were so pretty my only complaint is that grover’s skin tone was way too light.

""I have brought you a hero’s fate, and a hero’s fate is never happy. It is never anything but tragic.""


Reread January 1st 2019

Annabeth bringing a book on the quest because she's scared to be bored is the most me thing you could do.

Special shoutout to Sally Jackson, we don't appreciate her enough.

""Because you’re my friend seaweed brain. Any more stupid questions?"""

Percy Jackson foi um dos primeiros livros que li na minha vida e onde a minha jornada como leitor de fantasia começou. Se eu escrevo hoje e sou apaixonado por centenas de universos literários, foi porque tio Rick escreveu essa história incrível para o público infanto-juvinil. Muitos começaram com Harry Potter, mas a minha jornada começa com um aviso de um colega meio-sangue e um universo mitológico incrível.

A releitura foi quase tão prazerosa quanto a primeira leitura, mas agora com mais doses de nostalgia e lágrimas. Eu sou muito grato por esse livro existir e estou muito feliz com a adaptação que a Disney está produzindo."

So I am 20 years old, and I FINALLY read the first Percy Jackson book! It definitely lives up to my expectations. I really love the characters a lot and the dynamic they have! Percy is so stubborn it's really funny, and Annabeth is such a know-it-all and I love her for it! And Grover, my sweet innocent goatboy 😍
I'm really excited to see where their story goes so I will definitely be reading the rest of this series!
Also, Rick Riordan is king of inventing chapter titles! The title names made me so excited to keep reading because I wanted to know why he chose them 😂."

the percy jackson series is for me what the harry potter series is for other people. i never forgot how much joy this series has brought me, every time i remembered these books it just felt so good and nostalgic. i'm so happy to be able to read them again, this time in english for the first time (i first read them in portuguese, my mother tongue).
also, i can't wait for the tv show to finally come out. i've seen come clips from walker, the child actor playing percy, and i couldn't be happier with his cast choice. he'll do a fantastic job as percy.

1001,1002,5,"THIS BOOK IS AMAZING, okay I read this like a year ago but I didnt have GoodReads back then and just never felt like writing one until now. This book is what got me into reading, like this is still my favorite book till this day. I have yet to find a book that is better than this one. And Percy is still my fictional crush, obviously not him in this book but in the later ones lmfaoo. This book is so well constructed, the characters are likable and relatable, its easy to read, and educated well on Greek Mythology. I will continue to recommend this to everyone, no matter their age!! Idk ill probably add more to this later but yk what im saying"
1002,1003,5,"After my second read through years later I find it a 5 star bumping up the rating from 4 to 5

***
I enjoyed this book. I thought it was written very well and in a way that almost any person would be sucked right in to reading.

There were times that I thought this book was a little predictable (Then again I've read 100s of books by now) but not so predictable that I was rolling my eyes, more I kept reading to see if I was right. Sometimes I was sometimes I wasn't :)
I look forward to reading more of this series."
1003,1004,5,"Good!

Greek Gods, in the modern world, wreaking havoc, siring or birthing mortal kids, quarreling amongst themselves, all the things you remember from mythology, but in the now. Percy and his band of heroes take you on a great quest, and bring all those dusty gods and various other 'other-than-human' characters to life. Highly enjoyable. Getting book #2 today :)

Ares, Poseidon, Zeus, Dionysus, Hades
Kronos"
1004,1005,5,"Percy Jackson is awesome! One of the best fantasy books for middle readers and adults alike. Ok, I am proud to admit that I raided my son's book stash to read this. I don't know why I waited so long. I absolutely loved this book! To me, it was reminiscent of the Harry Potter books in the way they both have a young boy and his friends trying to stop the bad guy and lots of action. My son still hasn't read this book yet, but I did have his permission to read it. I told my son that I was going to read every book by Rick Riordan that I could find since I am officially hooked."
1005,1006,5,"This book had my eyes bulging and widening! It gave a lot of “ahs” and “ohs” and made me fall against my pillow in open-souled amazement. I fell in love with this Greek-mythology-themed story right from the first page.

Percy had to find Lord Zeus’ lightning bolt and Hades’ helm of death.  Man! Was I wowed? I carried it everywhere I went. The Lightning Thief gave me so much feels! Percy, Annabeth and Grover were a fabulous trio.

If you love Greek myths and fantasy, you’ll definitely love this book."
1006,1007,5,"I'm late to the party, but so happy to finally have my hands on these books! This was an excellent middlegrade read, with plenty of crossover appeal. The world building was some of the most comprehensive I've come across and built seamlessly into the story, which is just hilarious and exciting and really interesting. I loved that it didn't patronize young readers with oversimplifications but instead offered an accessible, entertaining story with opportunities to learn thrown in. Can't wait to read more!"
1007,1008,5,"I was ten or eleven years old when I first read this book.
I got it for free due to one of those summer library reading programs- read this many books and pick out a book to keep. I am so glad I picked The Lightning Thief... I finished the book that same day.
I laughed the entire book and immediately started on the rest of the series.

These books actually got me really into Greek Mythology and Percy Jackson became my favorite book series and character for years, truth be told he's still one of my faves.

5/5 stars"
1008,1009,5,"I'm usually really scared to re read books I loved as a child/teen, especially as those in the fantasy genre are usually written in an obscene way, but this series just hits different. I think anyone can read it at any time. The characters are twelve year olds that are forced to mature quickly than others, abandoned by their parents and living in dangerous circumstances but you can still tell they're 12. Also it's great for representation!! The descriptions and narration in general were really immersive too"
1009,1010,5,"That ENDING..
Ghsgshgshsgssjnsjdk

I knew it was luke when percy,annabeth and grover came back because.. yeah
So I actually see where luke is coming from and I completely understand his pov in that matter and honestly I am with him in this point beacuse the only thing these fellow gods do is **** *** ***** ****** ***** especially Zeus 🙃

I'm the biggest fan of greek mythology I really like it 🙃

AND I HOPED WE'D SEE PERSPHONE come on Rick...

EDIT 1 January 2020:
I saw the movie yesterday......
Literally It is the worst movie addaption ever.
I get now why people don't like it"
1010,1011,5,"The more I read this book, the more I wish 12 year-old me would have read it.

The more I read this book, the highest my rating gets. I feel like this book, this series, this world are made for me. Everything I love in a book is there for me. Percy is witty, sarcastic and lovely. The world is pretty damn messed up. The dialogue is quick and snappy and the interactions are absolutely amazing.

The amount of mythology we come across is wild. I feel like The Lightning Thief is a book I will revisit again and again and again for many years because it’s just that good."
1011,1012,5,"Perseus Jackson, thank you for pulling me out from the depths of Tartarus a.k.a reading slump.

Even though I've read this book for the nth time already it feels like the first time all over again. I was so excited that I'll meet my demigod squad again and go on a quest with them. Percy Jackson and The Olympians is really one of my comfort books to read. It feels like home to read these amazing books.

PJO will always have a special place in my heart🔱💗

P.s. I still felt butterflies whenever our wise girl and seaweed brain banter and tease each other."
1012,1013,5,"5 stars!!
I was waiting since May to read the series as my exams were going on during that time. The wait was absolutely worth it. Percy, Annabeth, Grover, this TRIO was everything. I loved how the world was by Rick Riordan. It was easy to follow and didn't have huge info dumps which were refreshing. Chiron was one of my other favourite characters. Although I saw the betrayal of luke coming from miles away however the other twists were surprising and I really enjoyed it.Now i can finally understand all the memes, fanarts, inside jokes. YAY!!"
