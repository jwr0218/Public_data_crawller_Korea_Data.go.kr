Taking arms against Harry Potter, at this moment, is to emulate Hamlet taking arms against a sea of troubles. By opposing the sea, you won't end it. The Harry Potter epiphenomenon will go on, doubtless for some time, as J. R. R. Tolkien did, and then wane.

The official newspaper of our dominant counter-culture, The New York Times, has been startled by the Potter books into establishing a new policy for its not very literate book review. Rather than crowd out the Grishams, Clancys, Crichtons, Kings, and other vastly popular prose fictions on its fiction bestseller list, the Potter volumes will now lead a separate children's list. J. K. Rowling, the chronicler of Harry Potter, thus has an unusual distinction: She has changed the policy of the policy-maker.

Imaginative Vision

I read new children's literature, when I can find some of any value, but had not tried Rowling until now. I have just concluded the 300 pages of the first book in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" purportedly the best of the lot. Though the book is not well written, that is not in itself a crucial liability. It is much better to see the movie, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" than to read the book upon which it was based, but even the book possessed an authentic imaginative vision. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" does not, so that one needs to look elsewhere for the book's (and its sequels') remarkable success. Such speculation should follow an account of how and why Harry Potter asks to be read.

The ultimate model for Harry Potter is ""Tom Brown's School Days"" by Thomas Hughes, published in 1857. The book depicts the Rugby School presided over by the formidable Thomas Arnold, remembered now primarily as the father of Matthew Arnold, the Victorian critic-poet. But Hughes' book, still quite readable, was realism, not fantasy. Rowling has taken ""Tom Brown's School Days"" and re-seen it in the magical mirror of Tolkein. The resultant blend of a schoolboy ethos with a liberation from the constraints of reality-testing may read oddly to me, but is exactly what millions of children and their parents desire and welcome at this time.

In what follows, I may at times indicate some of the inadequacies of ""Harry Potter."" But I will keep in mind that a host are reading it who simply will not read superior fare, such as Kenneth Grahame's ""The Wind in the Willows"" or the ""Alice"" books of Lewis Carroll. Is it better that they read Rowling than not read at all? Will they advance from Rowling to more difficult pleasures?

Rowling presents two Englands, mundane and magical, divided not by social classes, but by the distinction between the ""perfectly normal"" (mean and selfish) and the adherents of sorcery. The sorcerers indeed seem as middle-class as the Muggles, the name the witches and wizards give to the common sort, since those addicted to magic send their sons and daughters off to Hogwarts, a Rugby school where only witchcraft and wizardry are taught. Hogwarts is presided over by Albus Dumbeldore as Headmaster, he being Rowling's version of Tolkein's Gandalf. The young future sorcerers are just like any other budding Britons, only more so, sports and food being primary preoccupations. (Sex barely enters into Rowling's cosmos, at least in the first volume.)

3,4,1,"Update: 23/8/2018 My review is still hidden from view on GR. If it were listed on the community reviews, it would be the third highest voted 1 star review. In fact, since it has now been hidden for five years, maybe it would be the highest. It was the highest voted negative review prior to removing it from view.

Should I make a list of my reviews in order of how proud I am of them, this would be somewhere in the dark. However, that doesn't seem like the point. The fact that it had 140 likes and several hundred comments has to count for something. As far as I can see, I haven't broken the on GR in this review.

I've decided to enquire further as to whether I might be reinstated. I wonder if they ever do that?

The REVIEW.

Enough. I'm putting this one to bed. I so don't want to finish it.

‘Not enough sex’ was my first thought, but then we do get to this part where boys are discussing the length and capacities of their wands and I perked up for a moment until I realised that they were actually talking about wands.

You will say that this is a book for children and that sex has no part in it, but, I think Randall has it right, as usual:


XKCD's take on young boys

Now, I don’t know a whole lot about boys on the verge of pubescence, but I’m fairly sure they are more interested in willies than wands. Perhaps this book would have sold better if the author had regarded that piece of advice. (Note to self: check if anybody bought this book. Perhaps the author would appreciate my thoughts.)

20 August 2013: My Harry Potter review has been flagged and censored.

Given that the review itself has experienced its own form of peer judgement via the voting system and given that it has been up for a couple of years or more I wonder if this is part of the new Amazon way?

To quote the advice sent to me:




The review guidelines are here:"
4,5,1,"Pathetic. Really pathetic.

Harry Potter is more of a Mary-Sue than Eragon. More than Nancy Drew. More than the worst of fanfiction I've seen.

He's rich, popular and famous for absolutely nothing of his own doing. He destroys the power of the big bad guy before he's a year old. He has the whole angsty past down pat. He instantly becomes the best at flying without ever having done it before, wasting all the older and more experienced flyers. And get this - he fries bad guys when they touch his skin because the power of his mother's love is so amazing that it protects him.

I mean, gosh, the only Sueish habit we aren't subjected to is multipage rants on his appearance each morning. Or the devoted unicorn of unusual powers, of course, but I'm expecting him to show up in the very next book. After all, she has to keep some plot devices for the next one, doesn't she? Can't put all her brilliant twists out at once...

*heavy sarcasm*

Don't even get me started on the plot. Epic failure. 'Nuff said.

Harry wasn't any excuse for a hero. He did nothing, he just sat around and things happened to him. End of story. His fame was inherited, his fortune was inherited, he lived with his relations and allowed them to bully him, and couldn't even manage to read his own mail. His wonderful skills were not worked at and studied for years but picked up instantly, and he bet the bad guys by electrocuting them with his infamous zapper skin.

I could go on for hours. The thing that really gets to me is that is the great literature of our age? What hope is there for any decent writers if all kids want to read is this utter garbage? What hope is there for the world if kids are growing up thinking this is good literature?

This is a dangerous book. It made me consider both suicide and mass homicide, and it is definitely not suitable for children."
5,6,1,"I'm going to change my ratings for the Harry Potter books from 5 to 1 and here's why:

Recently I've learnt about some problematic writers and then I changed my ratings for the books. I did not do these for the Harry Potter mainly because of nostalgic reasons. But let's change that.



I'm extremely for the hurt caused to her and all women by men. This however is no excuse to be a TERF (Trans Exclusive Radial Feminist).

First and foremost let's talk about what Gender and Sex mean. Sex is biological made up of chromosomes, genitalia and hormones. On the other hand Gender is socially construct way of enacted roles and behaviors. The two are often used interchangeably but are not in fact the same.

Since she talks about biology let's talk about sex. Unlike popular belief it is not binary. There are many intersex states; some more obvious; but all equally deserving of our love and respect. Some people with an intersex state may not know until later in life about it.

(Transgender: not conforming with your sex (assigned gender) and changing it)
(Intersex: biologically (chromosomes/genitalia/endocrine hormones) not falling on the male or female spectrum. They may conform to a particular gender)

Since she talks about menstruation let's mention a few women who do not menstruate: intersex women, women after menopause, and trans women. Menstruation is associated with females but does not equal to womanhood and not menstruating does not does decrease your femininity.

If you live in South Asia; chances are you've seen so many abandoned trans woman and have heard harmful stereotypes about them.

Trans Women are not a danger to cis women any more than the other cis woman. Which is of course possible any one can be dangerous but the trans part has nothing to do with it.

When a publishing industry called her out. She threatened to sue and they issued an apology. She is a rich and powerful lady and she's using that privilege to silence people. You can't say you're for freedom of speech and then use your money and power to silence. This is the move that made me do this.



Let me start by telling you that I absolutely love Harry Potter (I gave it 5 stars) but that doesn't mean there isn't anything wrong with it. I appreciate how it taught so many people about love. Most of these things were not obvious to me the first time I had read it.



Harry Potter like most popular franchises is mostly white.

All characters of colour are minor characters. You might not even remember them I'm going to talk about some of them:

The Patil sisters.
The only South Asian characters and We barely see them. The most we see of them is them being Harry and Ron's last resort. But of course these South Asian girls are not good enough for our white boys. Harry and Ron should be grateful for getting any dates at all but no they are jerks to them. Parvati is the vain girl (like a lot of girls with more traditional femininity. Also the movies gave them ugly cultural dresses; how would they know? If they did more research they would. The Harry Potter movie makers have put so much thought into such little details but here they just went with ugly choices. But their just dresses? The whole world was watching them and when you are representing something you put the best out there.

Cho Chang.
The only East Asian character and we see her mostly as an object of attraction for boys around (cedric diggory, dean thomas and of course our harry potter). In the 5th book; Harry treats her like shit and does not acknowledge the trauma of her loosing her boyfriend like that. The movies take it up a notch and make the only East Asian character a sort of villain. She's a ravenclaw in the books which means she's supposed to be very smart but somehow we never get to see that side of her. Her name itself is racist.

Dean Thomas.
Of course it's not racist if our main white guy is friends with a black guy right. We don't really get to see that much of him and he eventually becomes Harry's romantic rival for Ginny. Also I'm not sure if I remember correctly but I think he was a toxic boyfriend to Ginny (correct me if I'm wrong). A black guy shown as a toxic boyfriend? You see what's wrong here don't you.

Lee Jordan.
Fred and George's black sidekick and commentator for the Quidditch games. That's his only character.

Nagini.
I can't tell you much about her since after hearing how problematic Crime of Grindelwald were I never watched it. Here is what I know: An Asian character is a snake and servant to Voldemort.

Leta Lestrange.
I can't tell you much about her since after hearing how problematic Crime of Grindelwald were I never watched it. Here is what I know: Black character dies to save white men and advance the plot.


You want to make a main character black you actually go ahead and say it in the books. If she could make minor characters black in the book she could've done so with Hermione too. You can't just look at social media learn about diversity points and change your white character to black.



Some fat villainous characters: Crabbe, Goyle, Uncle Vernon, Dudley. The writer loves talking about fat roles of bullies. Characters that are considered cool villains however do not have these: Draco, Snape, Voldemort.



All except one house elf is happy to serve their master. The house elves have no sense of self worth. Even Dobby who has some self worth and wants to be free does not think it's right to ask for more pay and has it reduced to a minimum. No character; literally none at all care about this; getting freedom for them is not on their's or the wizard's agenda. Except for our white saviour in Hermione; but even she can't do much about it since she's called stupid for caring about such useless things. The ""Happy slave"" trope is used by white people to feel good about their atrocities; they feel good about just treating the slave with basic human decency and forget basic human decency is the opposite of slavery; no person serving without getting anything in return is happy. Any movie/book you've seen this trope in is by a white person and is possible based on the white perspective too.



Here is something that I never realised on my own. And thank you for people on social media for teaching me about it. And I cannot explain this very well. But the goblins here are Jewish stereotypes. The Jewish economic myth makes Jews look like villains who are greedy and big nosed and horde wealth. This is how the goblins here are portrayed.



Whether you acknowledge it or not Queer people exist. And their not fairies so will not die if you just stopped believing in them.

Queerbaiting.
I read the Harry Potter books and never knew Dumbledore was gay because he's not in the books. But she said he is on twitter. Then the Fantastic Beasts movies were coming out and he was not gay in the movies either. This my friends is queer-baiting.

Lycanthropy.
This again I learnt from social media and I'm not very good at explaining this
She said in one of her interviews this condition of being a werewolf was a metaphor for HIV/ AIDS. Fenrir Greyback is known to attack kids in the books. There are harmful stereotypes of gay people being pedophiles and this goes to encourage that stereotype. Now if Fenrir Greyback was just a metaphor for pedophiles being monsters that would've been good.

All of this is not to guilt shame you for liking Harry Potter. It's to show you how something so beloved can also be problematic. It's also ironically beautiful that something with so many hateful tropes gave people the message of love.



Do I even have to elaborate this?


If you really must buy second hand books and unofficial merch for your fandom feels. And lower your ratings.

I hope you read this whole thing. You might even have learnt something. I actually wrote this in a very sarcastic tone first then fixed it. I'm still learning and if you find any language here to be hurtful let me know and I'll change it."
6,7,1,"It is a bewildered girl who writes this. After all, her mind reasons, isn’t this THE children’s series? The best thing to have hit the bookstores since Narnia? There must be something tragically wrong with me. Surely my mind has twisted this into something other than what’s really there. Right?

Unfortunately, I don’t think so. You see, I’ve realised something. I might only have just finished book one (yeah, I’m just a little behind the times), but I’ve realised something. Harry Potter is a Mary Sue, Gary Stu, Marty Stu, whatever you want to call him. Let me say it again.

HARRY POTTER IS A SUE.

No wonder it was boring and bothering me so much. I can hear you future readers (at present I have exactly none) demanding to know why, just why, I think he is a Sue, and how dare I? Those of you who haven’t fainted, that is.

*puts on mafia boss accent* You wanna know why? Let me count the ways. If you could just keep track on your fingers–oh, it looks like you’ll need your toes as well–that would be really helpful.

Right. Here we go.

1. He’s hated by all the nasty (some of them ridiculously evil) people.

2. And liked by all the good ones.

3. He has a cool scar, black hair, and green eyes. Like, yeah. He looks cool. This is the reason I stay away from the black hair/green eyes combo in my own writing: it’s really something that gets doled out by most authors to their specialest favouritest characters. And boy, is Harry Potter special or what?

4. He’s famous. Not only that, but everyone bows to him in the street. I think we just discovered Buddha’s successor.

5. He’s rich. Insanely rich. What are the odds?

6. He got into the best school for magic around. Without even applying.

7. He’s a Gryffindor, the most fantabulous house in the school.

8. He’s fantastic at broomsticking even though he’s never had any practice whatsoever.

9. Immediately, instead of getting punished for breaking the rules, he gets put on the Quidditch team even though it’s unheard of for someone so young to be there. And this is after the teacher sees one single display of catching a Remembrall. Ever heard of beginners’ luck? Adrenaline-fuelled ability, perhaps? Heightened senses? With all this, she still decides that Harry should be in the Quidditch team.

10. Continuing the theme of complete and utter Sueness: FREE BROOMSTICK! Not only that, it’s the latest in broomstick technology.

11. He got given his broomstick by a teacher. I will leave you to guess the phrase that applies here. Starts with ‘t’ and ends with ‘eacher’s pet’. Wow. You got it. Tell me, have you applied for Mensa yet?

12. He then impresses everybody on the Quidditch team with his special specialness to such an extent that he’s likened to the greatest Quidditch player in a hundred years (who was also definitely older than Harry when he played Quidditch).

13. Invisible cloak. He’s got all this, and then to add to it, he gets an invisible cloak.

14. He’s smart.

15. He’s brave.

16. He’s good at magic. These last three combined are a Sueness Overload in themselves.

17. And yet, even with all these qualities, he’s so generous and brave, is purported to have such good judgement, etc., that you feel as if the urge to like him is being shoved down your throat, stirred until properly combined, and left to set for three hours.

18. This is the part that made me almost throw up: Hermione, for no good reason, throws her arms around Harry and tells him how great he is, and that she’s basically not worth half of what he is. Just stuff some more Sueness down our throats, why don’t you, J?

19. Harry just escaped major Sue-ity again because Neville Longbottom’s final points are the ones that win Gryffindor the House Cup/Trophy/thing. Still, Ron and Hermione win a generic fifty points each. Harry, of course, has to get sixty. Minor Sue-ness.

20. Yeah, he loses Gryffindor a massive 150 points, but he gets it all back, doesn’t he? Being treated like an outcast doesn’t really seem to have made an impression on him at all.

21. Instead of being punished for heading into the third-floor corridor, he is rewarded. Now, make no mistake, I do see that there are times when we should break the rules for the right reasons. But surely, to maintain order, shouldn’t the ‘perpetrators’ be punished on the surface of things? Surely Harry should be given grunt work or detention or something, right? Wrong.

22. The way he was saved from the evil Lord Voldemort is by nothing other than Pure Love. *cue sparkles*

23. Dumbledore turns out to have given Harry the cloak. Surely, having been a teacher for many years, he would recognise what mischief kids get up to, and would really NOT want a boy whose friends include the brother of Fred and George Weasley to have access to an invisible cloak. Or, if it comes to that, any kid at all. T-E-A-C-H-E-R-S-P-E-T.

I wouldn’t care if HP only displayed a couple of these characteristics, but he’s got the whole lot! The thing that really drives me up the wall is that surely this should be the ultimate guide for what not to do when writing a book, and yet… and yet… it’s a bestseller. It’s not sour grapes that keep me writing this post. It’s sheer confuzzled amazement.

The writing style is boring and forgettable. No description to speak of, no real thoughts. There are some allusions to historical figures and terms, and so on, but they aren’t presented in an interesting way. And couldn’t we have at least met Nicholas Flamel?

The morals in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone are negligible at best. It’s just me, me, me propaganda in disguise—one lying, sneaking, and even ‘immobilising’ episode after another. And that’s from the so-called ‘good’ characters.

Cliché after cliché abounds in this book. It’s there in Dumbledore’s white beard. It’s there in Harry’s surprisingly quick Quidditch triumph. It’s there in Professor Quirrel’s turban. And most of all, it’s there in Draco Malfoy, a character so flat he could’ve been made out of paper and then run over with a steamroller and his original shape would have been slightly rounder.

Added to which, the plot is so unoriginal. Can anyone say ‘Cinderella’? Orphaned child mysteriously left with a mean, boring family who doesn’t want him and treats him terribly. Discovers that he really belongs to a world beyond his wildest dreams. And that he’s very, very rich. Almost immediately, he’s at home there. Sure, he has his enemies, but who doesn’t? And they get dealt with anyway. Added to which, it turns out that his parents are super-cool.

If that’s original, then I’m Neville Longbottom’s true love. Turns out everybody who keeps calling this original is Neville's honeybunchkins.

I had to struggle to finish this book. Really struggle. I had it out from the library for nine weeks because I kept putting it down for ten days or so, then realizing I should probably finish it to see if it got better. I’d pick it up and realise that I’d forgotten what had happened before, meaning I had to go back to the beginning and start all over again. This, as you may well imagine, drove me nuts.

Eventually, with the help of SparkNotes, I managed to figure it out and I’ve just taken book 2 out of the library. I’m wondering if it gets any better. After all, J.K. Rowling’s run out of Cinderella storyline. Considering how much people love this series (to me at this point in time, they are inexplicably popular), I’m not going to end with a pessimistic “I don’t think so”. I might go with something more like this:

It’s got to, right? Right???

--------

*Disclaimer: As I am not at this point in time a Harry Potter fan, I’ve probably gotten a couple of things wrong, although I’ve checked and double-checked to the best of my ability. (If you see any errors, please comment and let me know.) However, even if a few things are a bit off, there are still about twenty points on this list. Surely that’s enough to merit consideration anyway."
7,8,1,"So, this is the book everyone loves?"
8,9,1,"You're a wimp Harry.

Harry is the perfect bland character that the reader can feel at home with. He does not have any talents that anyone would be jealous of or feel threatened by. He is not overly attractive, tall, muscular, athletic, intelligent, coordinated, over-the-top, brave, confident, knowledgeable or talented. In fact he doesn't have any hobbies or interests to speak of when he is first introduced. He is completely and totally average.

But here is the kicker, even though he is totally average, everybody knows his name and his fame has spread throughout the magical world. This is easily every kid's dream. To not have to work or be talented, and still be gifted with this intense fame and notoriety. It's a perfect bed-time story that you would tell a small child and could easily be replaced with, ""Sammy you are such a special little boy and everyone saw how special you were right away. The whole world knew Sammy's name and just how special he was.""

Not only is Harry well-known but is always under the media's eye and captures headmaster's (and other people of power) interest. Another testament to his 'specialness'. Harry's character reaches into the childish need of people to be recognized for their talents that they already possess, not for working hard or striving for improvement of these talents. We want to be praised for just being ourselves! Harry also can do whatever he wants and go into the blocked off areas of campus. This feeds another childish need, the need to explore and be bad and see if you will get reprimanded. However Harry is never reprimanded, in fact he is praised for his behavior. He is so 'special' that even when he is being bad and not following the rules, it's because he has picked up clues that no one else but him, a child, can see. He is quite literally the 'the one and only'. As a reader this is enticing! How amazing would it be to be Harry! To not have to work or study or earn these adventures, but simply through your birth and by being yourself, you were given these adventures and have a different set of rules than everybody else! As Harry, you are prized and one-of-a-kind.

However everyone has to experience some hardship and Harry is given his by being left as an orphan. Another childish dream come true! Who needs nasty parents that always ruin your fun? (Disney agrees. Parents affect the plot line too much). Naturally this works out well for Harry. It gives him a pitiful, depressive attitude and buckets of money. Now he has money, no one to stop him or set rules for him as he goes gallivanting off to fight the Big Evil. It also gives him a chip on his shoulder that the reader can sympathize with. Without this sympathy Harry would just be an average kid who won the lottery and got to practice magic at a cool school, but since he is an ORPHAN that won the lottery and practices magic the reader feels bad for him and works even harder to like him and feel connected to him. To put the cherry on the top, little rich magical Harry is forced to live in a nice home with stupid people. They don't beat him but instead refuse to give him gifts and make him feel more average and like a weirdo. What reader hasn't felt like a weirdo in their life? This struggle is the final connection to Harry and the reader is drawn in hook line and sinker.

Although Harry consistently moans about his loneliness he has a close knit group of friends that would give their life for him. In order to make up for Harry's average self his friends possess more talents, cleverness and influence than him. The headmaster has power, Hermione has intelligence, Ron has strength and a place for Harry to stay/family, and Hagrid has information and access to the school. Therefore Harry is lifted from the burden of ever having to improve himself because he has amassed friends that can help him in any situation. Score. However average Harry is having a hard time making friends at school due to jealousy. It seems oh so strange that people would dare to jealous of little rich magical famous Harry. In order to combat this jealousy Harry easily discovers that his does have a hidden talent: flying on a broomstick! It was locked in his DNA (thanks Dad!) and needed no training or experience to work perfectly. Now he has one claim to fame that the other kids can admire instead of be jealous of! Since he will fly on the Hogworts team he is now an asset to the student body. Yay Harry! You have succeeded without work again! However these team practices are often too much of a commitment for Harry so he finds many excuses to miss them. Since he is such a favorite, the team agrees.

But Harry has run into some trouble. It seems that his refusal to be friends with a rude boy has led to ever-lasting hatred! Poor Draco is given no depth besides that of a preppy little twat. Harry can't fight someone more interesting or pitiful than him so it's better that Draco has no personality or any excuse for the reader to like him. We wouldn't want to forget about Harry!

But what is the point of having powerful friends, magic, money and fame if you have no one to share them with? Big relief, Harry is poised to fight the Big Evil! It seems that he is the only one who can do it, not because of his own merit of course. It's because his mother was so amazing that she wrapped him in her love like armor. Harry is the most well-loved orphan of all time! Step aside Annie. Good thing you have armor Harry, it would be very boring for the reader to hear about how you had to train and exert yourself to defeat the Big Evil. That is also something the reader has a hard time relating to. After all, the reader has never been in an epic fight with magic. Also it would ruin the whole childish appeal of the novel if Harry didn't have some secret way of defeating the Big Evil. This secret way is easily accessible and coveted. Instead of a sword or an amulet, Harry has feelings and everybody has feelings so we all can stop the Big Evil! Thanks for involving the reader Harry!

I hope by this part in the review you have recognized my sarcasm. If not, feel free to re-read.

Harry, the epitome of our Facebook, Twitter, fame-ridden dreams has also recently become the center of many new college courses. What a better place to study average Harry than a place of knowledge! To achieve the full experience of understanding and becoming Harry, colleges now offer clubs where you too can play on a broom! *These clubs vary in their descriptions, see a college catalogue for assistance* Also once you sign up for a Harry class be sure to pick up the pamphlet for the next new class, scheduled right after Harry, for white privilege! Don't let this juxtaposition fool you. It is natural to be interested and obsessed with both topics. Although Harry is a white, rich, famous male he is an orphan that experienced some mild bulling so there is no way he could fall underneath this new buzzword category of 'white privilege'. If this confuses you, please rant on FaceBook about it."
9,10,1,"EDIT:
I won't support transphobes. She has shown her colours many times and I've decided that my nostalgia and my feelings as a kid are not worth the harm JKR causes to trans people, including children. Trans people are dying, either being killed, death by lack of health care or suicide.
This is not a fucking joke anymore and no book, no memory, no love for the characters is going to save this anymore.
Even medical professionals and natural scientists are explaining how fucking wrong she is but she won't listen. So she's wrong morally, scientifically and humanly.

What I could ignore as a kid to some extent - the racism, anti-semitic dog whistles and other problems - is now too apparent and too impactful to ignore.

Trans rights are human rights.
Anti-trans ""activists"" are siding with fascists, neo-nazis and ethnonationalists.

I'm done with JKR.
My nostalgia and love for certain aspects of the story is not more important than trans rights and the lives of people.

Goodbye.



I have to sort out my thoughts on HP1 but one thing I want to mention: while the trio is studying for the final exams Harry lists different topics they have to study for history, one of them being the ""goblin rebellions"".
Against who or what did they rebell? Different fractions within the goblin community or against the wizards?
This right here hints to very deep social and cultural problems in the Potterverse, which is later expressed via Dobby and the goblin in the last book.
Rowling couldn't have tackled every aspect of the world but still...I would have loved to read about those right now! This is a big issue and it's glossed over!

Oh, one more thing: Ron is less goofy as in the movies, like not really goofy at all, Neville is already incredibly brave, Percy is amazing, and the twins are awesome!

**************************

The first time I read the first book in the Harry Potter series I was flashed. Funnily enough, my mother had bought me book four first. When I started reading I was confused as hell. I didn’t understand what was going on – obviously, because I didn’t know any of the story and therefore being plunged into another perspective than the main protagonist’s was off-putting – so I lost interest and stopped reading.
I don’t know how much time passed but one day I decided to read book four again and after a few pages I stopped. Then came the hard work of convincing my mother to buy me the first book because how could I understand everything if I didn’t read the previous books?!
My mother was as much of a bibliophile as I was – and still am – but she hesitated. It’s all the same anyway and it doesn’t matter and…
But no. I wanted it to be done properly! Start with book one! She also claimed that the book she bought was book one and I had to proof it to her by showing her the page inside the book promoting the previous books. It still took me several days to convince her I was right.
Or maybe she didn’t want to buy the book because it was about magic and for her magic is Satanic. No, I’m not kidding. The day I started being interested in horoscopes (and similar things) I was called a Satanist and whatnot. Although I never believed in horoscopes and I still don’t but that didn’t matter. I was merely curious. (Don’t ask me why she bought the book in the first place because I never asked for it. That woman makes no sense.)
Funny how things turn out because years later an Italian channel had an hours-long program (Yes, hours! With lots of pretty, half-naked women. Italian TV for you. No, were not Italian but we know the language.) and there was also a horoscope expert (expert, yes…haha) giving the weekly horoscope for each sign. She watched that shit religiously and flipped the fuck out when something or someone made even the slightest noise the moment it was her sign’s turn. (“I don’t believe in it, is just like hearing it! And I only believe it when it’s positive!!!!” Sure, mom. >_> Go talk to Jesus. He may believe you.)
Or she didn’t want to buy the book because we were – and still are – poor as fuck and buying a book for 20-30 Swiss Francs was pricey. Usually we went to the library, which was free.
In the end she did buy it and I read it and I was transfixed.

I loved the Twins, knew Hermione and Ron would end up together (it was so obvious), and didn’t like mean Snape or know-it-all Percy. I absolutely loathed the Dursleys.
After that, I devoured book two, three, and four. I know, many adults and readers critical of HP will find it stupid or amusing but I cried when Diggory died. I was 13 and his death seemed so sudden and unfair. It still is. (And then some more people died and I cried some more…meh.)
Oh, the third book. Sirius and Lupin (Lupin, you cute bisexual werewolf and your unfulfilled crush on Sirius…sad story). The core of their story – Lily, James, Lupin, Sirius, and Snape – is still one of the most tragic things. I imagined how Sirius must have felt growing up in a family that lived off hate and then losing his friends and being accused of their deaths. Lupin lost all his friends in one day; to death, prison, or betrayal.

Now I’m 28 years old and I’ve been thinking of re-reading the series for the gajillionth time. Though this time I would be an adult with new experiences, more knowledge, and far more critical.
Does the book hold up? Was it was fun, entertaining, and ground breaking as I remembered?

My honest answer?
I don’t know.

Rowling is not a bad author and she has a great sense of humour and she’s able to give enough information to tease but also propel the plot. But…in many instances I wished for more details. More descriptions.

An example: Harry and Hagrid go to Gringotts to get some of Harry’s money and a mysterious package. Standing in front of the Potters vault the goblin opens the door and tada, there’s all the moneys!
And I was sitting there like: Okay, but how does the door look like? Size? Colour? Material? Where did he put the key? Was it more a magical thing or a normal door with a normal key? How did the key look like? How does the vault look like? Was it dark or did torches suddenly flare up? What did the surrounding look like? Was it damp and earthy or more rocky, wet, and black? Rough edges or smooth surfaces?
And when the goblin opened Dumbledore’s vault by moving his finger, how did THAT look like?!

There is literally zero information!
I don’t know how anything looks, I don’t know how anything feels, I don’t know how anything smells, and I don’t know how anything sounds. Just “He opened the door with the key.”
Thank you for that terrific and colourful description.

This is one of many instances were details would have helped paint the environment so the reader could dive into the world and feel as if he was standing next to Harry.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not asking to get every minute detail and descriptions after descriptions, but you HAVE to use the senses and describe certain elements or your character is in a fucking void. That is boring. And also a betrayal of the reader because you are waiting for more and never get those pieces. You are forever without those bits.
Writing is about the balance between description and letting the readers imagination flow but imagination can’t flow when there’s nothing. Because if there’s nothing I’m not able to gather information on how the world works.

Example: If it’s a simple door with a simple key then the goblins are fucking stupid and stealing is easy but if it’s all magical, then their smart and theft gets more complicated.


Now to the characters.
Ron is less goofy and stupid than in the movies. I had totally forgotten that. He is way snarkier and bitchier than the silly goofball than Grint’s character.
Hermione is also slightly different. Although the biggest difference is still to come, namely when they made a beauty queen out of her in the movies.
Percy was great! I loved him! Smart, kind, and protective of his crazy siblings. He is also very proud of their accomplishments.
The twins are still fun, so that hasn’t changed. :P
Harry is still the same.
Snape… Reading the book and knowing what happened is really weird. But I remain with my judgement: he was overtly spiteful towards Harry. Yeah, yeah, it’s because he hated James, because James had been a bully and Snape loved Lily, I know all that.
It does not excuse why he treats an 11-year-old, who is a stranger to him and who has done nothing to antagonize him, like his fucking nemesis. Yes, that makes his character appealing and interesting, but it makes him also disgusting and worthy of a few slaps.
Dumbledore was as I remembered him and even crazier.


A few random thoughts while reading:

- While studying for their final exams Harry mentions goblin rebellions in a throwaway line. Dafuq are those rebellions?! Tell me more about it! Were they rebelling within their community or against wizards? Give me more!
- Yeah, Dumbledore, Snape saved Harry only because James had saved Snape’s life. Sure.
- Lol the bezoar is mentioned in the first potions lesson. I will never be able to think of bezoar and NOT hear Coldmirror’s freestyle HP audiobook. I love that woman. XD
- Hagrid is an alcoholic. Wow. Just wow.
- There was no reason for Draco not to tattle about Hagrid having a dragon apart from “it fits the author’s plot”.
- The trio wanted to warn Dumbledore about Snape stealing the stone instead of rushing into danger? Wow, I had absolutely forgotten about that. They weren’t as stupid as I remembered.
- Okay, I understand why Harry thought Snape was the thief but…after the first book Harry should have at least some doubt concerning his wild ideas on Snape. Yes, Snape was an asshole but I think he proved in the first book how he ticked. Although I guess both of them had unhealthy fixation on each other. >_>
- There is something else but it slipped my mind. I will add it as soon as I remember.


Rowling manages to make interesting inter-character relationships and hints at further things to come in a wonderful manner. The most interesting thing for me are the conflicts. Unfortunately, the lack of details drain the colours from the world and doesn’t allow her to fully flesh out the characters and their relations.
And no, I don’t believe in “but it’s for kids!” because you can write great books for kids and not dumb it down too much. Give them something to think and challenge them!
In the end, the book was alright. I don’t know if I would have continued the series if I had read it as an adult. And that makes me sad because the story I read and that stayed with me for all these years was so vivid and magnificent it felt as if I was part of it.
Nonetheless, I will never forget the tragedies some characters endured because it was them that made me fall in love with Rowling’s world and it’s them I miss the most.

And now I’ll wash away this feeling of betrayal with GameGrumps and some books."
10,11,1,in this house we do not support transphobia
11,12,1,"These books terrify me.
They are badly written and they have plots that don't make sense.
Read Artemis Fowl instead. Please!
Anybody who tells me that they have only read Harry Potter and / or The Da Vinci Code scares me even more.
That statement will keep me away from the books and away from the people who read them."
12,13,1,"Harry Potter is like Fifty Shades of Grey in the following ways:

1. The hype about the books is what sold the books. The books themselves suck.
2. The writing styles are horrific.
3. The plots are flimsy and meandering.
4. The characters are one-dimensional and simplistic.

Both books are a testament to the overwhelming power of the insinuous, insidious, and saturatousness (I just made up a word - fuck you) marketing machines in the US (and UK).

They are shining examples of the marketers telling us what we should like, and us believing them without questioning why we should care about a girl with no self-respect, why we should not be insulted the assumption that us girls will swoon merely by a billionaire taking off his shirt, why we are going to tolerate a meandering tale of a wizardlet who plays pseudo-soccer, then births a dragon, then finds a unicorn, then..all the million other side-stories Harry Potter stumbles through.

What else would explain our collective lack of insistence of a cohesive story that does not rely solely on deus ex machina to move a plot forward (you know - invisibility cloaks introduced 3/4 of the way through), our acceptance of cardboard cutout characters named after their personalities (I'm talking to you, Draco Malfoy and Mr. Grey).

I demand more from my taste-makers. I expect The Story of O, I demand , I insist on . The fact that I am not only spoon-fed this shit, but expected to it is beyond annoying. I don't like being treated like I'm stupid. I don't like being coerced into books that clearly exist in order to make me see the movie version, then buy the outfit, and the Barbie editions and the comic book renditions.

I just don't like either of these books.

Now, on the other hand.... that's a book I can bite into (harhar)."
13,14,1,Rowling is violently transphobic.
14,15,1,"For years I've had a dislike of the Harry potter movies and a simple disinterest for the franchise as a whole. Everytime the topic of the movies come up and I try to voice my opinion I'm met with a ""yeah but you haven't read the book so you're basically talking through your ass"". Well, after years of hearing that stupid argument I read the book and I can only say it didn't improve my opinion of the movies or the franchise as a whole.

The main problem I have is I can't suspend my disbelief about this world. I've read other ""young audience"" books and liked them well enough but I can't ""buy"" this world. It's not the ""wizard in a modern setting"" thing either as I'm a fan of the Dresden files. It's more a ""this world is such fucking nonsense"" thing that bothers me.

Overall, the thing that bothered me the most is that Harry is basically the Paris Hilton of the magic world: he's an heir to a fortune and he's well known for being famous while being famous for being well known. He's not a particularly apt wizard (though he can ride a mean broom) but the whole reason for his continued life is because Voldemort and his minions haven't figured out that a mother's love might protect you from the most devastating spells but it's generally poor protection from muggle guns. Or even sharp pointy sticks.

Harry also spends the whole book (if not the whole series) just flaunting or ignoring the rules. So the whole damn story can be boiled down to ""popular kid gets away with doing what he wants"". How original.

That's not to say I don't think Harry Potter isn't the Star Wars of this generation. It damn well has to be, it's basically the same story except with kids. Young boy (Harry/ Luke) raised by his aunt and uncle (the Dursleys/ Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru) discovers that he's got some sort of power (magic / the Force) and has to go away to a secret school (Hogwarts / Dagohbah) in some elaborate setup to fight the ultimate evil (Voldemort / the Emperor). Of course before going to that school, he must encounter a bunch of shady characters in wretched hive of scum and vilany (Diagon Alley / Mos Eisley). Along the way he'll be helped by a potential female love interest that will go unrequited (Hermione / Leia), a handsome rogue (the weasley twins / Han Solo), a wet blanket who might a little too much ""by the book"" (Neville Longbottom/ C3P0) an annoying noise machine that will solve a crucial puzzle or unlock a door when the plot calls for it (Ron / R2D2) and shaggy pile of useless fur (Hagrid/Chewbacca) all the while guided by an old dude fated to die who might have the hots for the hero (Dumbledore / Obi-wan).

But I will give give credit where credit is due: contrary to Star Wars, and knowing what I know of the series, some plot elements feel a lot more planned than what Gearge Lucas has served us over the years."
15,16,1,"If I were, say, eleven years old, I might think this book was worth three stars. You already know why I'm reading it as an adult, despite its obvious appeal to youthful readers: it has had enormous cross-over appeal, so that not only children and teenagers are picking it up, but also supposedly ""mature"" readers.

I have nothing against popular fiction, or young adult fiction. When my youngest brother started reading fantasy fiction while I was embarking on a PhD in literature, I happily bought him a pile of fantasy fiction. When people are young, encouraging the reading habit is the best thing you can do. It starts a healthy habit. I began with Stephen King, myself, and that was preceded by my own fantasy phase.

What puts me off the Harry Potter books is how they have become acceptable reading for adults. I have had graduate students who want to write their MA dissertation about Harry Potter. I get it: there is some interesting stuff being done in genre fiction that deserves some academic attention, but believe me, this is not it. This stuff is for immature minds. It's not even good or innovative fantasy. Harry Potter is a Mary Sue, and the world that Rowling has created is one bland cliche after another.

So, if you are seventeen years or younger, go ahead, read all the Harry Potter. In fact, read whatever you like, omniverously, because at this stage in life, it is good for your brain. But if you are an adult, these books should be way beneath your maturity level. If they are not, then don't talk to me until you have decided to grow up."
16,17,1,"Fuck Jk Rowling.

I understand childhood nostalgia causing people to still have some attachment to these books, but supporting this series monetarily in any way is absolutely inexcusable. With all that Jk Rowling is doing (and the problematic shit she put in these books) I'm rating the series 1 star.

Also Jk Rowling could've been so much more imaginative with the wizarding world, but instead she created a magical version of capitalism. I expect fantasy to be innovative, not repeat the same patterns of thinking that our society conditions us to accept."
17,18,1,"After month and months of hype, I sat down and read this book. I went into it with some hesitation ( mostly because I was tired of seeing fruitcakes in costumes ), but figured it was bound to be a good read.. EVERYONE I talked to said so.

All I kept thinking throughout the whole thing was ""Dear lord, this harlot has ripped off 'Books of Magic'! Right down the effing owl!""

I finished the book pissed off and permanently biased.

How anyone can say that this woman has any talent ( I'd say besides plagiarism but Neil permitted her to use his idea way back when )is beyond me.. she hasn't got an original idea floating around in her head."
18,19,1,it used to be a five star but then rowling wanted to be a transphobe so 😐
19,20,1,Overrated!
20,21,1,"Didn't like the first one at all. Found it utter garbage. People told me I should read the last one, that it was better written, more mature etc. tried it, and nope. Still garbage. Shame.

To sum it up: story was pretty much stolen together from different sources, characters are cardboard cut-outs, uninspiring and unlikeable with a few exceptions. (Snape has some dept.) The main character is a whiny kid, the bad guy is laughable.

The language Rowling uses is poor at best, full of repeated lines, clichés etc. The dialogues are unrealistic and annoyingly stupid at times. The story itself is full of plotholes and characters make moves that make no sense even in the senseless universe these books conjur up.

Just bad literature basically. I can't imagine why this is so popular. But then again, so are Twilight and 50 Shades... (Which are far worse even)"
21,22,1,"These novels have amazing worldbuilding but are not very well written.
The villain is one dimensional, the storyline is overly simplistic, the adults are criminally negligent and the author became the villain in real life.

The treatment of Goblins is antisemetic and the House Elve backstory is unbelievably racist, a magical race that WANTS to serve, lol, sounds like a commercial for the Confederate States of America.
It's just not that good.
I read every book and watched every movie.
Rowling is also horribly, violently transphobic.
Her work can't be removed from her bigotry.
The major irony is Rowling is now friends with the same folks who banned her books 20 yrs ago.
She's an ass clown."
22,23,1,"I have read this book twice before and hated it both times. So, what do I do? I give it a few years (and a few hundred other childrens/YA novels), then read it a third time to see if my opinion has changed.

Nope, still hate it.

I was practically raised on SF and Fantasy, be it for children, young adults, or adults. With that much exposure to the genre, I think that this book is a really poor offering. It pulls from so many other sources that the only thing even vaguely original about it is all the ""magic"" names she came up with for different things...and even that concept is as old as time.

I admire that she was able to become so popular (even as I cringe to think that is popular ""literature""), but at the same time, I think this book should only be a springboard into bigger and better things...like Eddings. Or Modesitt (as formulaic as his Recluse becomes). Or Clive Barker. God, or even L'Engle, and I can hardly stand reading her books, they put me to sleep. At least they contain . And .

So...I'll probably force myself through the second book, since I actually haven't ever read that one. My students love them, and I need to know them in case they ask...but man, talk about pulling teeth. It's almost as bad as Gossip Girl.

1/5 on here, 2/10 for myself."
23,24,1,"EDIT: lowered to 1 star. I hate JKR
Decided to bring the score down to 3 for my re-read.
Harry Potter represents a weird set of fiction for me. I really do like it and the magic system/world it created. The movies are silly and fun to watch, and the first time I tried reading the books I thought they were just as wondrous and joyful. However, I have to be completely honest and say that it is by no means the greatest book ever written.
I think one of the biggest factors in why people think so highly of these books is because they grew up with them or because they're very familiar with the story and it holds a special place in their hearts. Well, I didn't grow up with Harry Potter and it didn't much affect me at all as a kid. And really reading it now that I can comprehend what's happening (That's another thing, I feel like when people read books when they're young they don't notice it's not that great because small children don't really process stuff like that) makes me notice that it's just not the phenomenon it's hyped up to be.
Harry Potter is
I can appreciate it for impacting the fantasy genre the way it did, but I just can't lie and say that it's amazing.

Not everything has to be a literary masterpiece. Some stories can just be funny or entertaining. But that doesn't mean that they deserve any less criticism. For such a beloved childhood series, it has a serious lack of representation (Cho Chang doesn't count. That's the most racist caricature name I've ever heard of. And she's hardly a main character) and not to mention the fact that the author is completely insane on twitter and will ramble on about things
Anyway, I don't hate Harry Potter. I really like the story. I like the movies and the magic and whatnot. But the book was clearly not written for me, and that's fine."
24,25,1,"Hoy he decidido cambiar la puntuación en redes sociales de todos los libros de la que no debe ser nombrada. En twitter tiene siempre unas salidas de tono impresionantes y lo de este fin de semana ha sido intolerable.
No voy a separar la obra de la autora ni voy a fingir que la historia la escribió otra persona. La escribió quien la escribió, y quien la escribió es una tránsfoba que va de feminista y de defender los derechos de las mujeres. Una intolerante, una homófoba y una persona a la que no deberíamos querer en nuestras vidas.
Y me encanta el merchandising de la saga (que ya no tanto la saga, llevo años convencida de que si la volviese a leer me parecería bastante mediocre), pero esta señora no va a seguir llevándose mi dinero."
25,26,1,"My mother had originally given this book when I was about 12 years old, so probably in 1999/2000. At the time I had already had other classic children's literature under my belt, such as The Chronicles of Narnia, and I had also *just* finished reading The Hobbit. So when I was given this, it looked a little silly but I decided to give it a go. I think I managed to get as far as Harry actually getting to Hogwarts before I pitched it. At the time Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was enough below my reading level that I just couldn't get into it.

As I got a little older and the films started to roll out, I realized something: I loved the *story* of Harry Potter, but I really cannot handle J.K. Rowling's writing. So I continued to watch the films and love them, even going so far as to have ""coffee dates"" with my best friend where we would sit and chat and she'd tell me about details in the books that I wouldn't know otherwise.

However, after YEARS and YEARS of dealing with ""You haven't read the books?!"" and ""You really need to read the books!!!"" and similar sentiments, I got fed up. Fine, I'll read the bloody books. So I just finished Philosopher's Stone and I have the same opinion of it now that I did when I was 12. The writing is pretty horrible, but it has lovely characters and an amazing story to tell.

I'm currently reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and it isn't really any different. Friends tell me though that it gets significantly better with the third book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. They say it's because this is when Harry Potter essentially stops being a children's book (which I have nothing against as I love children's lit, IF it is well written) and that Rowling's writing improves steadily as she writes more books. Also Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the first of the Harry Potter films that I really loved (first one I actually purchased) and remains to-date my favourite film in the franchise."
26,27,1,"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books have achieved unparalleled popularity. At over 450 million books sold, this is far-and-away the bestselling book series in the history of the planet. There’s a solid reason for that, which I’ll discuss later. But …

I read the first in the series, and it turned out to be one of very few books that I disliked enough to give it away after buying a brand new copy and then reading it. I won’t read any more of them.

So what’s wrong with me? Surely the problem is mine. I liked the movie well enough and saw it before reading the book. Was that the problem? I think not. I think it’s my age and life experience.

The childhood English-author classic that I was raised loving was Winnie-the-Pooh (‘only’ 70 million sold). Compare A.A. Milne’s writing style with J.K. Rowling’s and you may begin to understand my problem. What I disliked most about Rowling’s offering was the bland, uninspired and uninspiring style. For her, and for the young people who swoon over her books, it’s the imagination, the imagery that matters more. Why? This I cannot answer. But I have a guess. Have we become aesthetically numbed by television? There was no TV in my house until I was six years old, in 1954. By then I had practically memorized most of the Pooh stories.

Pooh and Piglet and Eeyore have delightfully distinctive characters (Christopher Robin not so much). On the other hand I found Rowling’s characterization surprisingly 'cardboard'—completely devoid of inner voice and emotional depth. As prose, this book is a failure. As a light story-telling experience, it is well done. However, again, given my lifetime of experience prior to the publication of this book, I found that most of Rowling's imagery was borrowed from off-the-shelf templates that have been rattling around in our cultural psyche for many generations. The originality lies only in the minutiae.

The book (and the series) appeals to its fresh, squeaky-faced young target audience because it introduces this cultural heritage to them; and thus will forever 'own' it. And I suppose that's the true 'magic'. Not every author is able to so comprehensively tap in to and bring to life the touchstones of her culture—to voice a narrative that is already familiar but not fully actualized in so many of our minds. All future generations will view this magic-fantasy sub-genre through Rowling's eyes, and that's not a bad thing. She has vividly enriched it and gathered many myths into one 'compendium'. Think of how the anonymous 1823 poem ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"" has defined Santa Claus and much of the surrounding myth and tradition of secular Christmas celebration. I think that’s an apt parallel."
27,28,1,"This book gets a resounding 1. Because 0 is not a viable rating apparently.
Having been a big reader and a huge fan of Fantasy during my youth and even now, in the later stages of my youth, I have always looked forward to a big series of novels knowing full well that they would be filled with Glorious events that will no doubt tie-in later on in the series.

Well, I was wrong when it came to Harry Potter. The Protagonist is the typical 'I'm a poor little orphan destined for great things, I've never set a foot wrong in my life and I am the very obvious hero of this story' fucker that we encounter too often in this day and age.

But, it's not so much the story that bothers me (though it is predictable and repetitive, It's J.K.Rowling's writing style.

'Specs McGee stepped on the grey step, the step was really grey like something that is grey.' Is not a valid description for a completely invalid object.

I don't even know where this review is going so I will stop. But seriously, Harry Potter And The Completely Fallible Storyline Of Repetition And Bad Description is the worst Book and series I have ever encountered. Worse even than Twilight."
28,29,1,JK Rowling is a transphobe and her books are garbage.
29,30,1,"This is my third favorite book in the series, I really liked, It makes me remember my childhood, The book is by far better than the movie obviously, And I'm gonna re-read it soon!."
30,31,1,"We need to stop acting as if Rowling had invented the concept of magic. My first encounter with magic schools was not with this book, and people who claim that theirs was with this book probably don't critically read much. Has anyone who loves this book ever heard of Wizard of Earthsea (1968) or The Worst Witch series (1974)? Once you realize Harry Potter series is to writing as McDonald's is to food, it all makes sense. Children and a certain kind of adult love it. Everyone else...not so much. Maybe she writes fantasy for people who don't read fantasy.

Also, if the fact that Rowling, who make professors here basically useless, implies that 'muggles' are simply inferior didn't bother you then, it should now because, in my opinion, the gift of magical ability here is so random and somehow makes you better than those who don't have it, and that's just so wrong."
31,32,1,I've DNF'D this for the final time.
32,33,1,"First of all, I'd like to make this clear, this is my opinion so please don't hate me for this review, because a word of caution, this is as truthful as I can be. { Warning :: Please don't read this if you believe J.K. Rowling is an amazing author & that Harry Potter was one of the best books ever written ~ This review is not complimentary, it is honest. }

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was the most uninteresting, down-right crappy book I have ever read (& my mother agrees too, since I read it for the both of us). With plenty of unrelated & uninteresting events, chapters that go on without really being at all related to the story, clues that don't make sense, far too pathetic & unrealistic characters, far too dim a story for any imagination to work at all, clues that point to the wrong person being the bad guy & unexpected turnouts that seemed too ridiculous to be real . . . I have no idea how J.K. Rowling managed to become a worldwide best selling author or how Harry Potter ever become a best seller anywhere.
{Unless she made a deal with the Devil?}
I'll be honest, I watched the movie first, I've watched it since I was a kid & now I've grown & decided to read the book, I realize that the scriptwriter of the movie was some kind of imaginative genius to have turned this horribly crappy book into a movie that is spectacular. From what I know, books are supposed to be more insightful & knowledgeable than the movies or series they're turned into but for Harry Potter, I think, it's reverse. There were more than several hollow points & mistakes in the book that the movie had the fillings of. The characters were by far awful, ridiculous, & did not at all match with their personalities~~for example, a person has to have some level of intelligence in order to play chess or in this case, wizard's chess but Ron who lacks in the brains department was basically the best chess player in Hogwarts for years? Did not make any sense! Hermione is supposed to be cool & collected, using cool logic but what about the important scene with the Devil's Snare where Ron & Harry were being killed & she couldn't find a simply answer about how to beat the plants & panicked about not having any wood to light a fire? Bursting into tears? Easily leaving Ron behind to continue on with Harry? & Harry Potter! Is he supposed to be the protagonist or the poor knock-off creation of a character that doesn't evolve, doesn't grow, is automatically appointed the leader of their little threesome of a group without even holding enough intelligence, smarts or powers to be the leader? Bullshit.

I know, it sounds like I'm just mindlessly bashing out on a book that I hated but I'm just being honest. There was absolutely nothing likable about this book, Dumbledore was the most stupid character I have ever read, he's supposed to be a genius not a mental loony posing as the greatest wizard ever lived! I am at a loss as to how Harry Potter ever became a best seller. The creatures had no originality, they were all either taken from the ideas of Greek mythological creatures or legends or from countless other books, all I want to say is, those poor authors that J.K. Rowling stole ideas from were probably much better writers & authors than she ever will be.


P.S. This does not mean I won't continue the series to know what other mind-numbing things J.K. Rowling as written.

Oh, I loved the movie directed by Chris Columbus. It was extraordinary compared to this horrid book."
33,34,1,"I don't understand what the big fuss is over this book. I thought the characters were whiny and self-absorbed, the writing mundane and not catchy, and the story not very original, with the beginning echoing A Wizard of Earthsea, which did it better in every way, shape, and form. I personally wouldn't ever recommend this book to anyone, I thought it was shallow, uninspired, and felt like a waste of my time to read.

It was actually part of a required list of books for a sci-fi/fantasy class I took in college, and was the only title from the entire semester that I didn't love."

35,36,1,"This is a hard review to write. I read this book with my wife and daughter and even advocated for the author's work a few times. Sadly my appreciation for this entire series has been spoiled by recent outbursts that the author has chosen to make. It can be devastating when someone you respect as a mother and an author chooses to use her platform to devalue your own existence.

Despite what has been said in media my guess is that Harry Potter will continue to be deemed a 'classic' for the near future. However I can no longer endorse this or any of this authors other stories. What people say and do matters and no matter how good a person's work is their ideals reflect upon the characters and worlds that they create. Disenfranchising an entire population of people cannot be ignored, nor can it be forgotten. I hope one day J.K. Rowlings can see the damage she has done and the hurt she has spread and perhaps learn to respect all people in the many wonderful verities that we come in. Should that day come, and I pray that it does, I will reconsider my boycott of this series and the author who brought this magical world to life."
36,37,1,"I dislike Harry Potter. Not going to lie.
Now, I'm a tumblr-person. They say that Harry Potter is the gateway fandom, et cetera, ho ho aren't we witty?

I'm not going to go into full detail because I'm lazy and have homework to do, but these are just dull. Dull, dull, dull.

The writing style is atrocious, to me.
x said, y said, z said. With the occasional 'mumbled' or 'shouted' or 'gasped'.
And there's enough adverbs to shame a bad roleplayer.
God almighty.

It's apparently undecided how many publishers rejected the first novel, but the general consensus is that it's somewhere between 9 and 12.

Don't you think there's a for that?

Not to mention all of the spell names are stolen directly from Latin, exempli gratia-
Accio: ""I summon.""
Confringo: ""I break into pieces, I ruin.""
Crucio: ""I torture.""
Imperio: ""I command.
Levicorpus: ""I lift.""

37,38,1,"I didn't get to write a review for this incredible book right when I finished it so I'm writing one now.

First of all, it was NOT how I expected it to be like. For some reason I always thought that the writing would be hard to get into just like any other classic novel, they have a great meaning but for people who don't speak english as their mother language it tends to be pretty tough. So the writing was wonderful I thoroughly enjoyed it, it was quick and easy. I would have finished this book in one sitting if I wasn't so busy that month.

The characters! Boy oh boy, some seemed a little different than how the movies portrayed them to be. Mostly Hermione, she was the one that stuck out to me the most. Before I got into this book I tried my best not to make comparisons with the movie (which was quite easy since it's been a while). Therefore, at first, Hermione seemed like that annoying student that keeps correcting people and (probably) silently judging them. Which is exactly how people describe me! So that was just perfect. But anyway in the movie she sounds a lot more kind to the others than the book. I don't know It's probably just me. Let me know if you thought that too.

Their world is so thought out it's mesmerizing, whenever a place is described it's simple but complete and not wordy to get the reader bored easily. It's just the right amount of details that give you a good picture of what it looks like, but also keeps your imagination running.

I truly loved this book and can't wait to read the rest of the series. And I totally regret not buying the full box set when I had the opportunity."
38,39,1,"So I debated counting this at all.

I read this with low expectations and without the mindset that I will completely hate it. My only rule was that I couldn't DNF.

This was the most BORING thing I ever read. I wish I skimmed read this. The writing style just wasn't for me and I HATED the pacing so much. It felt like this book was going to last FOREVER.

The inherent fat phobia throughout this was beyond frustrating. Even if J.K. Rowling wasn't a transphobic piece of trash the fat phobia alone would be enough for me to hate her till the day I die.

I cannot see why this book is so loved people are willing to ignore the creator's problematic views to keep reading I DO NOT see it.

Of course I know a part of this is because I am outside of the age group meant for this Story and I know nostalgia can be powerful so I do see why it's so loved and I can see how if I was younger I might have loved it. I am just frustrated with this book as a whole.

As I would have never read this on my own I told myself to list things I did like about this because I do feel guilty trashing the world's most favorite book series.

-Some of the names for things were funny to read.
-I do like Hagrid he has always been the exception for me.
-The dessert talk in here makes my mouth water ngl
-I dunno I like trains?

45,46,1,"You know, I read this back when I was in my early teens or so and unlike other things I didnt like from my past I wasnt going to write a retroactive review because I didnt want the flack from half the world's population. But considering that this book and the series it spawned has become the go-to cultural reference point for every single boring and entitled centrist/neoliberal/liberal tool in the world I think its about time I rectify that point.

I would have given it 2 stars in my youth, for its offensive twee and serial adverb abuse being only the tip of the problems I found with it and struggled to even get through, but I could, at least, see the appeal to others and why it caught on.

But now that it has inspired an entire 'movement' in my generation for constant substance-free analogies to literally everything no matter how unrelated I feel it deserves a 1 just for its negative cultural and intellectual effect on the Anglophone world alone. No wit, no things that actually fit, to say nothing of the fact that perhaps these nerds will understand contemporary political events better with some...I dont know...actual historical and philosophical points of comparisons rather than living in childrens literature for their understanding of everything? Rather than endless pop culture barrages of 'everyone I like is Bartledore (these people often also like the West Wing, because of course) and everyone I dont like is Voldemort.' This self-righteous and manichean world view, which once came from monotheistic religion, now comes from childrens books...and due to the unfortunate puritan background of our societies, such views are always seductive to the basics.

I mean, Jesus, I thought Sonic had the worst fan base, but at least they are liked locked in an attic somewhere and away from typical political discussion. No one thinks Sonic is Obama and Sally is Clinton fighting Paul Ryan's robot armies or whatever. Harry Potter though is the Bible, Qu'ran, and Dianetics of Basic Ass Libs. Ironically, it seems to be making them far more reactionary as a result too. It's the Blairite New Labour/Clinton Democrat version of the goddamn Left Behind series.

And if you dont believe me about any of this just go on facebook and check out left wing sites that parody liberals like 'Cursed Liberal Images.'

Those of us who preferred Redwall and His Dark Materials were far better served in childhood. Also, definitely grew up to be smarter on average."

I am one of the only people who doesn't like Harry Potter.



Now before you all get the pitchforks and torches to hunt me down so you can torture me I need you all to hear me out. I am not disliking this series on purpose or saying that they are bad, because that is not the case at all. I am not repelled by it.

When I was younger everyone around me always telling me how much they loved the Harry Potter books and the movies. Curious as I was I did watch a few of the movies and back then it already did very little to me and I never finished watching them. I just didn't understand why I wasn't liking something that everyone else was obsessing over? It could be because at a child I was already a diehard Lord of the Rings fan that I couldn't bring myself to care about anything else and resented the idea of these 'wizards'

So I thought, perhaps it's a good idea to give the books a try. I was twelve when I first read this book and really did try to like it. The writing style in this book put me off, I couldn't connect with any of the characters that I all found immensely plain and dull, and I didn't like the world building. I just wanted to throw the book in a corner and burn it and I still want to do that today. You should all try and give me some credit for trying to read this book . I just hate it when I cannot connect with anything in a book, but I did give it my best.

Now that I'm older I'm thankful I'm not a fan of this franchise since it's problematic. Also J.K. Rowling is an awful woman who doesn't deserve all the respect and admiration that she's receiving right now, because she's not at all nice to her fans.



So you can all get your torches and pitchforks because I don't care about this franchise at all. I just wanted to write my problematic relationship with it down so that I would perhaps understand it better, but I don't. It's just not my cup of tea and I don't mind at all. It's like I said I can understand why you're all fuzzing about this because you grew up with these movies and books and I didn't. I had Tolkien's work that I absolutely adored and even today nothing compares to that."
47,48,1,I dont get it. I really dont. I wanted to like this book. But nah I'm good
48,49,1,"This series will always be my biggest ""what if?"" What if I read it earlier? Would I have enjoyed it then? Probably. But reading it now...I was thoroughly bored. And disinterested. The writing style was too simple for my tastes. It wasn't the simple that I got used to, and eventually started to like. No. I was always aware of it, and I never could get into the story. I know that its a children's book, and of course the prose wouldn't be too complex. Again, if I read this earlier, I probably would have enjoyed it.

And the characters. Don't hate me but...Harry Potter is the biggest Gary Stu there ever was, and I just couldn't like him. I couldn't like or care for any of the characters, no matter how hard I tried. I guess this series is just not for me. Its one of my biggest childhood regrets, not starting this series earlier.

54,55,1,"I read this one when I was under ten, and from the very little I can remember, it was a page-turner. I quickly moved onto book 2 and finished that as well. But as I'm older, I thought I'd give it another shot to impress me. I've watched the movies and the early ones in the series were fine, if a bit boring. What did I think of book 1 in the Harry Potter series as an adult reader? It was flat, the attempts at dry humour were lifeless, and if I were to use describe B1, I'd liken it to eating a plain digestive biscuit. People have likened Rowling's work to being a derivative Enid Blytonesque school story with elements of Lewis Carroll, Cinderella, Wizard of Oz, Narnia etc. but I'm confused how these books became popular in the first place among adults and teenager readers. I've read the above works and let's be clear, they may have been influential in fantasy genre, but I didn't think they were good books. I'm not going to be offended with Rowling's work just because I think she borrows from these authors/works. I believe that each generation of authors can get ideas from preceding authors before them without their work being marked as a lesser, inferior, dumbed down substitute of past works. Who cares? I'm not going to use that argument where people say ""as long as it gets kids to read"" because Rowling's B1 is, let's be honest, an awful example of an engaging children's book. Despite what the HP fandom says about it and it being a cultural phenomenon, the first book of the series isn't a classic. It'll probably be forgotten about in about fifty years.

Brief summary: Harry Potter is a eleven year old boy raised by his unpleasantly nasty, Dahlian relatives The Dursleys. Their supposed to represent typical narrow-minded little Englanders. Harry spends the first ten years of his life suffering at their hands. That is, until he gets a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, run by the enigmatic and wise headmaster Albus Dumbledore. So follow Harry discovering that he is a special boy because he managed to survive against the evilest wizard of all time: Voldemort. Navigating school work and friendships, Harry, Ron and Hermione must solve the puzzle of the sorcerer's/philosopher's stone or else they risk allowing Voldemort back into the wizarding world.

Despite this being a shortish novel, I struggled with it. Mainly because nothing much was happening in the narrative. Some of the characters were cartoonish caricatures without much depth to them. It felt like I was reading about Harry meeting a selection of freaks over the course of the book, who just entered and exited. For example, The Dursleys were the typical pantomime villains, causing Harry misery, but other than that, we don't know much about them because of Rowling's decision to tell the story in third person limited through Harry's eyes, which is understandable since Harry is the main character, but it doesn't make for a good reading experience, having such exaggerated characters. I'm guessing that she tried to make them sound whimsical, but this being a muggle-world (i.e. normal, human world), it would have been more effective in the muggle characters didn't behave in such an odd way to provide a better contrast when Harry entered the magical world. As it stands, Uncle Vernon went to desperate measures to stop Harry from getting the Hogwarts letters by taking all his family to the middle of nowhere. This is a children's book, yes, but it doesn't mean the author has to make the human so unrealistic. In addition, isn't it strange that Harry was forced to live in a cupboard for ten years - that's tantamount to child abuse. I don't know where Rowling got that idea from... how many cupboards are spacious enough to hold a bed? Strange.

Harry doesn't really change throughout the story, so he's a rather dull character. Having said that, I did think the most interesting bits were when Rowling focussed in on his family history like when he saw all his family in The Mirror of Erised (reversed it spells 'desire'). Ron and Hermione, Harry's friends, seemed ok compared to Harry since they actually had hobbies and interests i.e. Ron's a good chess player and Hermione is a brainiac. I felt these characters grew over the story more in comparison to Harry who seemed to have things handed to him on a plate, by virtue of his family name. Malfoy was also another character who interested me despite being a spoilt little rich boy. Not exactly the most pleasant character, but you understand his jealousy of Potter.

I had issues with the reveal with Professor Quirrell being Voldemort's accomplice. I saw the clues embedded in the narrative, but his character was hardly in the story. Rowling didn't even give him much of a role, and his only distinguishing traits were his turban and stutter. The character development in this book is bad if the main villain in the story isn't even talked about, except in a passing sentence, perhaps a handful of times.

Rowling's writing was bland. There was no spark, fun, or liveliness to the story. It was neither detailed enough to keep my attention and encourage me ask questions about characters or plotlines, nor did it provoke an emotional response. Dumbledore has a few good lines in is dialogue, but other than that, B1 was very juvenile and strangely... charmless. Shallow and detached. Almost like I was reading about roughly-drawn characters in a 1940s boarding school environment, rather than reading an actual fantasy. For a fantasy, it was almost mundane. But maybe that's what makes HP appealing to some readers, because it doesn't stray too far from the norm, and that's comforting.

B1 ended to easily and pat for me, but I suppose Rowling couldn't show the gory bits. Wrong target audience. Judging it from an adult perspective, I suppose it would be a good entry-level fantasy story since it's not complex, but I'd hardly call it an awe-inspiring, and dare I say it, magical story, which stands the test of time."
55,56,1,I ABSOLUTELY HATED this book. Not my cup of tea. Sooooooo overrated. I was FORCED to read this book and the LAST thing I would EVER do is read the second book. Would have done negative 5 star rating. Unfortunately this was not possible.

59,60,1,"Somehow, I didn't get around to reading Harry Potter until now (2011), perhaps because it's billed as a children's book. I'm a fan of the fantasy genre, and I enjoy the Potter movies well enough, so I'll enjoy the Harry Potter books, right? Eh.

The book's label as children's fare is accurate, and alas, my childhood was long ago. I can picture myself delighted by the experience of reading the story out loud to a child, sharing the wonder of books with a young mind. For that purpose, I'll shout the praises of Harry Potter from the roof tops.

For myself, though, I was bored, which surprised me. The story is actually very imaginative, but the language is simplistic, and thus the medium engenders a sense of tedium. I didn't enjoy it and only finished it because I felt as if I'm to like it.

Perhaps I'm unfair. Shouldn't a children's book be judged a children's book? Usually, yes, but Harry Potter is a global, cultural phenomenon that enourages people of all ages to participate. And so I ask not whether children will like the book but whether I, as an adult reading for myself, enjoy it.

For children: 5 stars
For adults reading to children: 4 stars
For adults on their own: 1 star"

72,73,1,"I’m someone who strongly believe that children have a brain and that the explanation for a cheesy and dumb plot twist or plot in general is “But it’s for children” is just a lame excuse for a writer to be lazy as well as underlining the fact that our society doesn’t seem to consider the base and future of humanity as being able to think and improve while at the same time complaining that kids are dumb, that teenagers are dumb and then that most adults are dumb while they’ve been fed stupidities their entire life and somehow this is normal.

Now that I made my opinion about this book pretty clear, let’s jump into the details for the actual review. Harry Potter and the philosopher/sorcerer/it even has another name in my native language that has nothing to do with the original title/ Stone is a book that fascinated me in term of quality per like ratio. So in order to make it not too obvious that it’s a rip-off of the The Worst Witch, JK Rowling decided to go full Tolkien (for the series in general) with a complete Gary-Stue character for this first book but somehow she kept the famous: “I don’t go looking for trouble, trouble usually find me” way of portraying Harry in general while you look at The Worst Witch you can find: “She was one of those people who always seem to be in trouble. She didn’t exactly mean to break rules and annoy the teachers, but things just seemed to happen whenever she was around” except that Harry doesn’t have to deal with any weakness and things happen to him when the plot needs to and not as a character’s trait, yes Harry goes looking for trouble every single time but the books just tell us that no but keep showing us that yes and in the end he’s praised like a hero while a Deus Ex Machina saved his ass.

Starting with the beginning of the story we are following a usual uncle Vernon’s day, one chapter entirely for him and later he will only reduce as a fat and angry man with purple face and sausage fingers so we can laugh at him. So I’m asking you this question: what is the point of spending an entire chapter with him? Then we have the cliché of the orphan who is mistreated by his relatives but no worries he’s in fact famous, rich, got the only wand left with a phoenix feather in it, talented at Quidditch and of course Gandalf’s favourite. Fame, glory and convenient things threw in our hand is everyone’s wet dream in our current society; I guess this could explain why people like this series. ‘Yeah but Harry doesn’t like beeeeiiing famoooous he haaate this!’ the fan would say and I would reply ‘Then why isn’t he more vocal about this? Why doesn’t he try to restore the truth when Gandalf told him that it was his mother’s love that killed the bad Voldy and not Harry’s superpower?’ and the fan would screech in parseltongue while calling me a muggle but I wouldn’t care because this word is as silly as the final resolution of this book.

Now there is a moment when the author tells us that Harry never had any friend because fat Dudley bullied him and everyone else but here is a thing: in order to spend all those years not being able to make any friend you really need to have some bad social skills even when there are bullies around. Not to mention that at Hogwarts you have Malfoy and his gang who literally has a father with a lot of power in the wizard society but there Harry is fully capable of making friends and had no trouble to interact with people around him and to deal with Malfoy. We are also going to forget any potential damage that long term abuse can have on a child and for those in the back of the classroom that are going to tell me that not all children develop mental disorder when they faced abuses I’m going to tell you that it’s a lie. If you know someone who has been abuse and look like the most normal person ever then this person just hid it or you never paid any close attention. Alright look. I’m not asking for 300 pages of psychological development but I’m tired to see Cinderella’s remake over and over without anything original added to it.

I’m not going to complain about how every teacher is as much a caricature as possible with all the clichés that comes with it. But I’m going to complain about how bland Harry is as a main character and before anyone jump from their sit I know the argument of “But authors make main characters bland and generic so it’s easier for the readers to relate to them” then good for you if you consider yourself bland and generic because myself I don’t and if I want to put myself into a character I just go play an RPG or any other video game where I can actually control the character. Not to mention the lack of excitement that Harry shows when he’s put in the magical world like hello? You have superpower for god’s sake! Be a bit more enthusiastic than that!

I think I’m going to jump straight at the end while summarizing the whole thing: So we have the mighty Dumbledore who thought that hiding a dangerous object in a school full of children was the best idea every while at the same time hiring the very man who is after this object and who is also the bad Voldy *clap clap*. So we have a bunch of eleven years old kids who can barely make object fly with their wand have decided that they alone were going to stop some evil wizard fully equip with deadly spells. Not only they got everything wrong but we keep telling us that Hermione is supposed to be smart but waiting for Dumbledore to come back is not a smart idea apparently. Then we have the cliché let’s make a few task before you get to the stone, all of this while trying to tell us that it’s the brilliant teachers who set the tasks and that three eleven years old and even more clever than the actual teachers making them even more brilliant so what the hell are they doing in a school if they are so great in the first place? All of this sugar coated with sacrifice and power of friendship that make absolutely no sense here to end on the power of love that is the cheesiest Deus Ex Machina.

This is where this book really considers that children are stupid. Even more in the end when Dumbledore told Harry that Voldy couldn’t get the stone anyway because he wanted to have it so what was the point of doing all of this in the first place??? To summarize the ending Voldy would have never been able to get the stone so what Harry did was useless he could have perfectly hug Quirrell in a hallway and bye bye bad guy but then you have Dumbledore who’s like one million point for Gryffindor because some kids broke the rules when they didn’t even need to in the first place."
73,74,1,"I remember reading this series when I was about 9-10 years old. I remember adoring it. I remember reading it under the covers and crying when the last book was over. I remember being 12 and realising it really wasn't that good.

Okay, don't get me wrong, but I love the world of it. I love the characters (to an extent) and I love the plot. But the thing is, as you get older, you start to realise there are so many plotholes.

You realise that some characters deserve far better than how they were characterized in the books, as well as the cultures and nationalities they embody. (Cho Chang is meant to be Chinese, yet both her names are Korean last names. Seriously, this is racist.) And I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that these books should lose their relevance as god-class fiction as well, because so many people (including me) have been offended by this book.

The world building is gorgeous, but everything else just isn't going to work.
Honestly, I've read better. If you want to get into Harry Potter, I suggest reading fanfiction rather than this."
74,75,1,"Not enough espionage, and lack of heat. Harry is about as complex and inresting as a loaf of bread. I am in awe that it reached such status. Maybe I should liken it to football, intertains the masses, whilst lacking any need for thought or question. A shallow look at life at hogwarts from the point of view of an orphhaned boy who lived in cupboard. Best left to fans of other preteen reads like roald dahl, which shares a simillar premise of the mistreated child rising from bad circumstances but does so in a far more entertaining way.
Hogwarts its self steals the show. As the series progresses it becomes darker and more complex which I'm assuming is why they are rated higher."

How to rate a book (and the rest of the series) that, honestly, has meant the world to me for almost two decades?

Harry Potter:

I thought I would give Harry Potter the benefit of the doubt, and perhaps in the most perfect setting given the coincidence of having six-year-old step-son and the nightly pre-sleepy time story duty fell to me. What do you want to read? Harry Potter. Fair enough.

First chapter or so, it's quite a cool setting. The split cosmos idea: two universes, the ""modern,"" ""mundane"" universe of the non-magical 'Muggles'. Plus the secret entrance into the magical universe, with all the magical stuff and and evil warlocks and and a big school for wizard children who learn to cast spells (but never learn how to act.)

So far, so clichéd. Further into the book, I was still doing my best to do the voices for my stepson, because I try to make that kind of nice fatherly effort.

But that didn't last very long. Within ten minutes I was bored with the predictability of the anodyne conversation, and so as I read out loud to the lad, I began to play with the voices of the characters. Over time, too slowly for him to notice, I gradually changed the voices I was using for the dick-head characters into extreme San Francisco scene gays.

I had hoped Harry Potter would be new and updated and imaginative and push the genre forward. But it was tired, recycled and excruciatingly conservative. A private boarding school - in the 2000s. And Rowling is on the dole>? Write what you know, I always thought.

But in Rowling, pretty much every fantasy cliche was deployed, in an almost paint-by-numbers fashion. Basilisks. Check. Dragons. Posh stage school gits. Predictable storylines so guessable than we find it impossible to feel suspense.

But why am I so hostile, when it's only a fairy story? I like tribute, homage, satire, and even sometimes I like pastiche. But Harry Potter wasn't a tribute to the classic fantasy fiction European kids grew up with over the decades and centuries. The tired fantasy tropes and capers owed more to recycled Hollywood cliché than classic fantasy.

I must declare a conflict: I collect folklore, so I don't see an excuse for bad fairy stories. I am a spoiled witness. In the 1960s I became addicted to a series of anthologies by the great folklorist Ruth Manning Sanders. Ms. Saunders anthologised folk stories from all around the world, including Eastern European myths, African tribal folklore, Native American stories, and tribal stories from across the Indian subcontinent. The result was a huge let of anthologies of childrens' tales from across culture and time, passed down by long since extinct groups with cultural practices whose strangeness we find alien and startling.

Ruth Saunders would compile each anthology in beautiful subject-themed, illustrated story books, crammed with timeless oral mythologies of ancient fairy stories from the ancient history of pre-Iron age Europe, or the countless lives of the medieval cunning folk and wise women in Essex, and the Free Spirit outlaws of the dense European forests of the pre-modern period.

Go to the source, and not to the copyists..."
89,90,1,"If I remember correctly, in the Latin translation of Winnie the Pooh, the translator made a distinction between the word “follis” (an inflated ball) and “pila” (a solid ball, sphere). That’s the kind of shit I like to see, and that’s exactly the kind of shit I got to see when reading the Latin translation of the first Harry Potter book.

Peter Needham translated the first two Harry Potter books into Latin: and . The second book is noticeably better in terms of translation than the first, which is unsurprising; translating into a dead language is incredibly difficult, so of course there would be a learning curve. Notably, the translations are not in Classical Latin (i.e., the Latin spoken during the Roman era) but rather what’s commonly known as New Latin, hence words like (“train”), which certainly did not exist in ancient Roman times. There are some interesting details: “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named” is usually referred to as “Quidam” (, “unspecified someone”), although occasionally “Ille Qui Non Nominandus Est” (“that who not named is”). Names are mostly Latinised, i.e., “Harrius” for Harry; “Oliver Silvius” (, wood; forest) for Oliver Wood; “Laniger” (, wool + , bearing) for Fluffy; etc. Words like “Muggle” were Latinised, not translated, hence instances of “Mugglibus” and whatnot. House names were partially Latinised and partially translated. Strangely, the name “Hagrid” was put in the second declension for some reason; “Hermione,” the third, despite the fact that, in Classical Latin, the name “Hermione”—usually referring to the daughter of Helen and Menelaus—was in the first declension.

On its own merit the translation would warrant five stars for sheer hard work and creativity; however, I can’t in good conscience do so. These books were very important to me when I was a kid, because they helped me to learn English, but I’d be lying if I said my knowledge of the author’s current political views didn’t ruin the experience."
90,91,1,"listen to trans people.

as a nonbinary lesbian, i'd like to tell you about my feelings as a trans person who grew up with hp

i dont think u people realise how much it hurts trans people for whom hp was a big part of their life. the fact that something id loved with my whole heart, something that was my escape and safe space was written by a horrible human who hates my guts.

i don't care if ""harry potter was your childhood"", so fucking what. it was my childhood too. but trans lives are more important than your nostalgia. TRANS PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERYDAY. you can't separate art from the artist, not in this case. jkr is a powerful wealthy woman and her terf rhetoric actively HARMS trans people. if you support her then you turn your back on trans people, it's that simple

don't buy her books. if you want to read hp, pirate it, borrow it from a library, buy it secondhand but DON'T SUPPORT THIS WOMAN ANY FURTHER

besides, harry potter on its own is racist as hell.

i dont think i said everything i wanted w this + im bad at wording but if u support her and actively engage with the fandom DESPITE knowing about her being transphobic, get away from me thanks!

We all know this series so I won't be writing anything too much and it wasn't exactly my first time lol.
I just want to say a few things. I listen this time to the US audiobook this time around which I did NOT like the narrator for (Jim Dale), he made all the ladies sound like they were whining all the time and it just isn't as golden as Stephen Fry (Fry gets a chef's kiss from me).

When I was a kid, I used to look up to JK Rowling so much. She was my hero and I thought she was the coolest person in the world. It makes me so sad knowing how wrong I was then.

I don't tolerate transphobia or homophobia. It is discriminatory, hurtful and should not be supported.

117,118,1,"Why should you read this book? My answer…don’t. This book follows the life of a young boy named Harry Potter as he discovers who he is and what not. BORING. His life started with a tragedy. This book follows the same story line as The Odyssey (like most books). There is a hero who experiences a downfall. He has a journey to try and find himself whatever but his character flaw(s) cause some problems along the way. Eventually he realizes everything will be okay and the story ends with everyone generally happy. Why read a book that is like many many others just with different characters and a different setting. Also why read a fantasy book? Yeah there’s magic in this book. Smh at this one. Riding on broomsticks? Yes it’s all here. But you guessed it…Harry Potter is not a witch. Weird screaming ghosts in the bathroom? This book has it all! But still no signs of witches. This book seems like a halloween tale to me. Hmm, what’s that? Oh yes they do have a giant feast at some point in the book. But sadly this book doesn’t take place during thanksgiving. This book makes no sense. I almost forgot the houses. Each student is assigned a different house to live in based upon where a hat says they should be. Yep you heard right A HAT. A hat putting people on houses based upon if they are smart, mean, kind, or whatever ravenclaw is for. If that’s not stupid idk what is. If you haven’t developed a strong hatred for this book by now just go read it. You will eventually hate it as much as I do. Don’t watch the movie it’s just as bad too. Don’t listen to what anyone else says. Harry Potter is a witch and fantasy books like this aren’t worth my time."
118,119,1,"Overrated, author is a bigot."
119,120,1,"#8 Best Sellers of all time, estimated 107 million copies sold (Source: Wikipedia.org)

I read this about a decade ago. The level of affection for Harry Potter, the number of books sold, the awards given, the movies made and JK Rowling’s fortune have only grow in the intervening time. Friends who adore Harry convinced me to read it again. Unfortunately, I found it unchanged.

I loathe this pedantic and tedius story. From the Muggle popscicle stick theater characters’ cruel hatred to the normalization of wizardry, to the alchemy, I simply don’t understand what all the fuss is about. I can see that Rowling occassionally creates an interesting scene: Hogwarts castle or Diagon’s Alley, and the highlight of the book was Harry’s overwhelming mail which occurs disappointingly early for a highlight.

Harry and the other characters of the book are simply not developed. What are his likes/ dislikes? He is simply shaped by circumstances, circumstances that seem rather pandering (The people closest to you don’t see it, but you’re special! You are surprisingly rich! You have extraordinary abilities! You need a #2 wingman/ sidekick (Ron)! Capable girls will notice you (Hermoine)! The rules don’t apply to you! You have an exciting future ahead of you! etc), but Rowling doesn’t develop Harry’s CHARACTER.

Other characters appear and disappear according to a simplistic linear narrative, leaving no sense that these characters EXIST apart from their presence when facing Harry in the storyline. Clearly, Harry and his friends were in an elite category, to whom the standard warnings and boundaries of Hogwarts’ students didn’t apply – and Harry the most elite of all. Clearly, they were exceptional and have incredible abilities beyond their age, experience or education – and Harry the most exceptional of all. Clearly, the adults were rather worthless in dealing with the oh-so-scary-impending-threat – and Harry the most vulnerable of all (due to their neglegence). Clearly, they were going to come out unscathed (Excuse me, I yawned.)

Additionally, “this has never happened before!” and “don’t do that or else you’ll be expelled,” and “his impeding death seemed certain” rang false, I didn’t believe it and I never felt a sense of peril relating to either Harry, his friends, or their adventures. This is heightened by the mental suspension necessary to believe the children are both unaware that they are simultaneously incredibly brilliant and astoundingly dim as they fail to pursue lines of action that would provide clarity to their drawn out adventure.

I guess the bottom line is that while the popularity is impressive, the writing just isn’t that good. Yet this is the first book/ series for many of the young generation, who read it as children and view Harry as a friend from their youth – a breath of nostalgic security. I’m happy they found that in a book. It’s an attachment I can empathize with as I have many lifelong friends myself from books I read as a child. But, I wish we could get children attached to excellent literature.

120,121,1,"This review is for books 1 to 4 since I haven't yet finished books 5 to 7.

If I could somehow give these books zero stars, I would. I'm still in the process of re-reading them and I'm doing chapter-per-chapter deconstructions on my blog, in which I go into more length about all the problems I have with these books. I like to call it a service to the world.



As a fair warning, these deconstructions aren't for ardent Harry Potter fans. I started them well enough but as I process through the books, my patience with them is wearing thinner and thinner until I just don't care.

If I had to summarise my utter contempt for these books succinctly, though, it's that they're schizophrenically hypocritical. And when I say schizophrenic, I mean the colloquial understanding of the word.

Here're just a few examples of what I mean:

ROWLING, about Harry: Bullying is bad, m'kay?
ALSO ROWLING, about Draco, Percy, Severus and Dudley: Bullying is totally funny and cool LOL

ROWLING, about the Malfoys: Nepotism is bad, m'kay?
ALSO ROWLING, about the Weasleys: Nepotism is totally fine and dandy~

ROWLING, about Dudley: Ha ha, look at the fat kid waddle LOL
ALSO ROWLING, about Harry: They saved my life, those cakes~

ROWLING, about Lucius: Using kids to achieve your goals is totally bad, m'kay?
ALSO ROWLING, about Dumbledore: Grooming kids for their entire life to die like sacrificial pigs makes you the greatest wizard of modern times~

ROWLING, about Hermione: People can be a bit stupid abou' their pets~
ALSO ROWLING, about Ron: I thought you two'd value yer friend more'n than rats~

ROWLING: Vernon judges others by their cars
ALSO ROWLING: gives Harry the Bestest Broom of the Current Year™ not once but twice

ROWLING, about Muggleborns: Draco is a hateful racist because he called a girl who dissed him first a mudblood~

ALSO ROWLING, about Muggles:

MINERVA: Even Muggles aren't completely stupid~
HAGRID: attacks a terrified eleven-year-old Muggle boy for something his dad said
MOLLY: Packed with Muggles, of course
ARTHUR: treats them like exotic zoo animals
BOOK TWO: Squibs are wizards
HARRY: blows up Vernon's Muggle sister with no consequences
OTHER WIZARDS: erase her memories which is the magical version of gaslighting and also it actually gives the victims dementia
WEASLEY TWINS: almost suffocate Dudley to death on his own tongue

ROWLING: warns her readers about people like Draco
ALSO ROWLING: does not warn her readers about people like Dumbles, Hagrid, Sirius, Lupin, Weasley Twins, Dobby, or every single wizard in general

And on it goes.

Don't waste your time with these books. They'll just give you an apoplexy.

Here's a long(er) review for Book One:"
121,122,1,"Since HP has practically become a modern YA classic, I finally decided to read the first book to get a taste of the series. These are my thoughts, take 'em or leave 'em. :)

Rowling is an OK writer in the technical sense. She doesn't spend much time on world-crafting or eloquent descriptions, but focuses instead on a plot-driven narrative. There is little downtime in the events of the story, so the quick pace easily engages the reader. The story is written clearly and efficiently, and I appreciate some of the truly clever things such as the hidden train platform. However, the plot was the same old fantasy boilerplate--a kid with no connections realizes he's destined to save some fantasy world and become the hero. It seemed like the only purpose of the book was to set up for the rest of the series. Rowling throws in a few elements of suspense and mystery, but that's pretty much all that drives the book.

I was disappointed that Rowling portrays Harry as a hero when he does absolutely nothing to merit it. She sets up Harry as a poor, abused boy, and the reader sympathizes with him. However, when Harry's circumstances improve, it's not through his own effort; everything is simply handed to him--his money, school situation, and fame all come through the effort of other people. Harry repeatedly makes poor choices but doesn't have to suffer the consequences. When he breaks clearly-defined school rules, he is made an exception instead of getting punished, and sometimes he is even rewarded.

Authority figures are stereotyped; they are abusive, incompetent, or foolish. Even Dumbledore, possibly the only positively-portrayed authority figure, is described as eccentric.

Rowling doesn't bother to define good or evil; Evil wizards, including the villain, Voldemort, just ""went bad."" There is no appeal to Harry's sense of ethics; when Harry is bullied, he is vindictive.

In conclusion, while this book could be an engaging, easy read with sympathetic characters, it's no more than standard, poor-quality fantasy fare intended to indulge younger-readers' power fantasies."

124,125,1,"I have to admit that I don’t understand what all the hype is about – especially among adults. It’s been a while since I was a pre-teen (about 15 years), so I can’t accurately reflect upon how I’d feel about this book if I were still that age. As an adult-in-training, however, I didn't find it entertaining at all.
The moral lessons are so painfully obvious that they’ve practically got gigantic flashing arrows next to them saying things like, “Always do your homework, kids – even if you’re busy conceiving a plot to rescue the fate of humanity from Evil.” Perhaps these themes weren’t so obvious to the young readers out there. Maybe they even something. However, my moral compass is already well aligned, thank you."
125,126,1,"I missed out on the Harry Potter hullabaloo the first time 'round. I was 18 when the first book was released, and though I borrowed it off my little brother and tried to read it, it was very clear the target audience was much younger than I was, and the patronising tone of the book made me give up only a couple of chapters in. A few years down the line, with kids of my own, I tried reading it to them, but again failed to get very far. A few years after that I decided to just skip the first book, and go straight to number 2. It worked. While still a little on the patronising side, the second installment was bearable, and I proceeded to read the rest of the series, watch the movies and generally become familiar with the Potter universe.

But still, that sense of incompleteness bugged me. I'm the kind of person that likes to read an entire series, in order, and I knew that one day I'd have to grit my teeth and get it over with.

So today I did.

It's still patronising. Not surprising, as it's still a kids' book. The audience does age with the books somewhat, but this first one is very much a pre-teen book. When I was a pre-teen, I was reading Stephen King. This probably hampered my ability to enjoy books aimed at that age group, but you know what? I can live with that.

So while I love the idea of this book, absolutely the Weasley twins, and I enjoy the universe that has sprung up around it all, this particular book is just not to my taste.

And yet, the world still turns. ;)"
126,127,1,"Oh, how dare I say my opinion on the world most ""flawless"" book. After having this book shove in my face for years by people from teachers to strangers telling me to read Harry Potter.

I not going to say this book is boring. The word is too shallow and an excuse to not give a reason why you don't like something.

I do acknowledge that harry potter got kids to read. As for everyone seeing Harry Potter as the perfect book in the world and if anyone express their opinion why they don't like Harry Potter they are beating down and harass. I have seemed other people being treated like that why too much.


Harry himself is such a dull character. The way Harry is treated by the Dursleys, the reader is supposed to synthetize. Harry could show personality by being clever or let it affect his self-esteem.
Harry doesn't think for himself; everything is handed to him. Ones Harry gets the Hogwarts he already famous and is put in the best house. He disobeys and disrespect adults and gets rewarded for it.

The end is not realistic or teaches anything. The Slytherin House wins fairly all the points, until Dumbledore gives gratuitous points to Harry, Hermione, and Ron for bravery and other nonsense Making their house “win"".

If you want your kid to read something intelligent, give them The Neverending story. If you want them to read something that teaches friendship, bravery, selflessness, have them read the Warrior Cat series or teaches taking responsibility for your own ACTIONS, READ Earthsea!"
127,128,1,"There are so many reasons why Harry Potter is one of the worst books / series, such as the fact that he is such a Mary Sue, I cannot express this enough, he has also done NOTHING I mean literally nothing to deserve what he has. Harry Potter got his fame from his parents, his wealth from his parents, his popularity from his parents, I mean he has done nothing to deserve what he has, and yet people think this is “ok”, that people would be considered better because of what their family has done, not what they have done. That is simply going back to the medieval ages, learn from your mistakes people. Also Harry Potter is SUCH a Mary Sue, I mean when he was a baby he beat the strongest magician of all time, and if you think this is not enough, he became the best broomstick rider without legitimately any practice, he just got on the broom, and was better than the best. Harry Potter also has his ”zapper skin” where he literally touches anyone / anything and he defeats them. Harry is also so weak, he literally can’t open his mail, I mean seriously. He allows people to bully him, and he gets pity for it, he is literally too weak to stand up for himself, and yet thinks he is better than others, for doing what? Being born to his parents. And the plot, I mean seriously could this book be any more predictable and obvious."

Harry Potter defined my childhood and, quite frankly, my entire life in a way that no other work of fiction ever has or probably will. I can’t ignore that, and there’s never not going to be a part of my heart that doesn’t love it deeply, that won’t call Hogwarts “home”. However, as much as I love this series for their sentimental value, and for the meaning I took from it when I was younger, I can no longer stand by anything JK Rowling does or says. I love this book, I cannot stand its author.

It’s deeply troubling for me to see something so fulcral in my becoming the person that I am today be ruined by the person who created it. I’m aware that awarding this book 1 star won’t do anything to help trans people, and it won’t matter at all to JK Rowling herself, but it’s a way for me to get my thoughts out.

I’ve come to terms with the fact that I can now come back to this book and exist somewhere inbetween the adult I am, who hates what Rowling stands for, and the child I used to be. What a huge shame."
129,130,1,"Amo esse livro. Geralmente tenho uma quedinha pelos primeiros livros de séries e com Harry Potter não é diferente. Amo esse universo, a construção dele e dos personagens. Acho incrível a forma como tudo foi escrito.

Infelizmente, é improvável que algum ganhe 5 estrelas de mim porque é difícil eu conseguir separar a minha atual opinião sobre as casas dos livros em si. A forma como Lufa-Lufa e Corvinal são sempre menosprezadas, Sonserina colocada como apenas casa dos vilões e malvados e Grifinória dona da razão e das boas coisas, SEMPRE vai me deixar com os dois pés atrás e com discursos muito bem formados. Nunca vou superar a cena do Dumbledore humilhando a Sonserina na cerimônia das taças, mas entendo que faça parte da história e construção de situações e personagens.

Pelo menos temos como motivo pra ser feliz o fato de que J.K. escreveu estes livros antes de sua era apoiadora de Johnny Depp e falsa militante a favor de representatividade, apesar desse segundo ponto incomodar muito, principalmente hoje em dia.

edição 02/10/2023:
só deus sabe quando eu fiz a review de cima, mas to refazendo agora porque estou organizando minhas estantes aqui e em outros apps de leitura e me deparei com essa babozeira.

nota 0"
130,131,1,"Not sure what this behavior is called but people will overrate things in their early stages of discovery, such as a genre, medium, or art. And, that is exactly the reason why I chose to reread Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone about a year after I first read it; To test this behavior. The new medium for me was books and turns out I was quite right about overrating things early on.

Having barely read books before, I remember quite liking the first book of the series. On the reread, however, I do not think I would read any of the sequels if I were to judge it based on just this one. While I know the story is good, thanks to the movies and the earlier read, the way it is written is quite bad. The world-building is okay at best, foreshadowing is next to nothing, barely any characters are established, and ""Oh, how convenient"" felt jarringly strong this time around. It reads no better than fanfiction. And, I do not think the target audience is an excuse enough for how it is written

Not sure if I'll continue to experiment as I feel like it'll only ruin this series for me."
131,132,1,"I would rate it four, but it reminded me how my cousin Jake came to me with a wand and harassed the shit out of me. He claimed he could do magic with his wand. The one he would do the most is the voodoo doll trick. He would get my teddy bear, stab it with a knife, then had his best friend impale me in the spine with a spoon. Every time he would do it, a part of my body would be paralyzed. My parents would sit there, clapping for Jake. I would try to call the police, but my parents would beat me saying, ""You can't call the police on your family!"" One day though, my mom and dad weren't home, and he did the trick, so I called the cops. When they arrived, Jake's girlfriend was there, so he accused me of raping her, and everyone there supported my story, even though some of they all had just witnessed him stabbing me. I went to prison for 5 years, then Jake's girlfriend turned him in. Oh yeah, by the way, Jake was 8 when he would do this trick to me. It fucking sucked, like this book does."
132,133,1,"I'm leaving a review for the Harry Potter series as a whole, and while I can't deny part of the reason I feel as negatively about these books as I do is because J.K Rowling is a horrible human TERF who doesn't support basic human rights, I can honestly say I never liked the series, even though I grew up with them essentially following my upbringing. I was in the exact demographic to read these books and age up with the characters, and yet they always sat wrong with me. To me, they always felt like an overly hyped mess. I hate when everyone jumps on the bandwagon for no reason other than to be like, ""Oh, me too! Me too!"" I gave each and every one of these books a go. I really did. I tried. But they never lived up to the hype, and now that their author has come out as a hate-filled narcissist, I hope they disappear into the annals of history as a blip on the radar. We need some positive author rep out there, putting out stories far better than this that catch that hype train."
133,134,1,"This book series was my childhood, but rereading it now, Harry is just bland and unrealistic. Yes yes, this is a fantasy book, but his character just doesn't make sense. He doesn't seem to have any sort of trauma from living in an abusive household, he is accepted into the quidditch team and gets a free broom because coughfavoritismcough, and he is hated by every ""bad"" guy and liked by every ""good"" one. Also, Dumbledore definitely knew that Harry was living in an unsafe environment, why would he let Harry go back? Wasn't he supposed to be a kind and wise teacher? There are just so many things wrong with Harry Potter, and Harry takes up a lot of them. I would normally give a book like this three stars, purely because I like the ideas presented in this book, but JKR is a TERF and I'd sooner never touch a book again than give a transphobe's book more than one star."
134,135,1,"JK Rowling has just about as much bigotry as the sorting hat. This series is cruel. A fetishization of the British Boarding school system. A housing system which segregates one based on who they are. The hero is a rich privileged jock. The privileged ethnostate-esque isolationism of the wizarding community. And yet the text never engages with this from an analytical lens. JK Rowling has *always* been a bigot. It's in the text, and always has been.

‘But what does a Ministry of Magic do?’
‘Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.’
‘Why?’
'Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone' - Hagrid. A giant bigot."
135,136,1,"HARRY POTTER IS JUST OH MY GOD SO UGHHHHHHHH. I HATE IT SO MUCH AND THERE IS NO WORDS THAT CAN EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I HATE IT. mcp93NH0WlQWedA2dhuScDcHJ6DB6fXpVrPs04v8A8mf6a3/9tU62OGQfxk/rCvVnayedIA0Grmc62XurqOhp41k2wdtBbJ8Bk7U6CzzFxrhE9rJy7iF4nxkBsHUOmVZSQ2+2xNWSx9l/FJYxIIVQEZCySBXI8O6M6fk2DWp+0W0SS/4PqAP+0yH/AMVR8fei/dU/2gv5I7vh8asQks0yyD9ILbysoP8A3AH6UBZ5u/ezee8iz93YXJyRGWRcgKWyHLaCMK24ONsdal/9V3F/+TP9Nb/+2r97cOIyWlxYXUBCTKLhQxUNsRGMEHrs7ffV44JxeWThUdy7AytamUtgAa+WWzp6dfCgRgkfs54oXaMWhLoFLDnQbB9WnfmYOdLfdS3+q/i//Jn+mt//AG097 EXCUSE ME. I AM TRYING TO PUT IMAGES.

HARRY POTTER: ""OOOOH IM TEH BEST. *COUGHS VERY DRAMATICLY* ITS OK. GO ON WITHOUT ME. *DRAMATICLY PRETENDS TO FAINT*""

YEAH OKAY. HOPE YOU GET IT."
136,137,1,"Okay, I know this is a really popular series and that J.K. Rowling is now something like that richest woman in the UK, but THIS BOOK SUCKS. It's poorly written, and reminded me a lot of the R.L. Stine Goosebumps series of books that we read as children. Also popular, but terrible books.

The only redeeming quality of this book is the interesting world of magic that she has woven into what appears to be present-day England. It is a good story, I think. I do enjoy the movies, and maybe I should've given the rest of the books a chance, but I simply can't appreciate this book."
137,138,1,"I just don't get it.
The start takes so damn long like just GET TO THE SCHOOL ALREADY. I'm an impatient person I'll admit that but damn son that start was just dragging. And I was enjoying at first.
I will actually keep going on with this series as this is the only Hp book I've read... Twice now (mind you the first time I DNFd it so doesn't really count). Maybe the series will catch me in the next book 🤷‍♂️ all I know is I want to read prisoner of azkaban so I'll stick this out haha"
138,139,1,"Of course I enjoyed this as a kid, but that doesn't mean it holds up to the test of time. Between the anti-Semitism in the goblins, the TERF-y rendition that is Rita Skeeter, the apparent allegory of lycanthropy to HIV wherein one of the forefront werewolves wants to infect the non-infected, and ALL of the stuff that Rowling has done to tarnish her own name, this isn't a book that one can just return to."
139,140,1,"Boring, expected development and outcome. I read this book expecting something like the Lord of the Rings, but found a boring experience. Maybe for little kids should be fun, maybe the other books are better, but this made enough Potter for me."
140,141,1,"i learned that it was stupid and it shows you nothing. I think that if anyone liked this book they are blind idiots. it is so bad i wish i could sue jk rowling. this disgusting disgrace of bookkind does not belong on this universe. i cursed the day it was published. it does not deserve to be capelized.


-soph"
141,142,1,"Am I the only person in the world who thinks this is one of the all-time most boring books ever written? Maybe it's because the descriptions of magical apparatuses and broomstick sports are so labor intensive in terms of slogging through details. I totally lost interest about fifty pages in, but tried to slog through more in the hope that things would improve. Not. I gave up at page 190."
142,143,1,"I read this book out of curiosty. It's so popular, and everyone I talk to says they like it. The first book, I suppose, was okay, at the most. I am also against the encouraging of witchcraft and sorcery. By the fourth book, I couldn't stand reading about teenagers in school, because basicly, that's all it is. In my opinion, it really isn't that great, so don't believe everything you hear."
143,144,1,"It's nice that children enjoy it, but I chose not to finish the first Harry Potter tome. Admittedly, this is my adult reaction to the book. On this site, I've given five stars to the books in the Oz series and the Tarzan series, which I read when I was eight and nine years old. If I were eight or nine again, I might give a different rating to Harry Potter, but alas, I can't turn back the clock."
144,145,1,"I still love this novel but the author is a colossal piece of garbage, I cannot in good faith keep my original rating on this novel.

--ORIGINAL REVIEW--

Harry Potter's debut novel was an excellent introduction to the magical world of Hogwarts. Oddly enough, this is the only book in the series I've read more than once. But that is for good reason, as this is one of Rowling's best works"
145,146,1,"Snape was not sus and Neville is me for real

Edit: I decided to read the book critically. Neville is still me for real (I have severe CPTSD). But um… yeah this ain’t it bro"
146,147,1,"What can I say? J.K Rowling is a writing goddess

I'll be honest here and say that I've watched the movie first before reading the books. But I'll say this: Book is always better. Even in this one. They did a fantastic adaptation but nothing beats the book!"
147,148,1,"hey i only cried once

i took my sweet time and just soaked up this world i love so much. it’s been a hot second since i’ve reread these and i can’t wait to reread the rest of these with some of my favorite people. also people who rate this below 5 stars... i just wanna talk"
148,149,1,"Maybe it's because I'm not a teenager, but I thought this book read like something written BY a ten year old instead of about one. I know the series is wildly popular so I'll probably read at least one more, but seriously unimpressed."
149,150,1,"Aunque sigo creyendo que este libro es de cuatro estrellas, no puedo separar al artista del arte.
No me parece justo darle una plataforma a una persona que invalida las vivencias de un grupo entero de personas."
150,151,1,"Actual rating is 2.75/5

Geez, the writing is so straightforward and if it wasn't for the adventure that I know awaits from this point on, I would've closed the book immediately when it first released."
151,152,1,I didn't even finish the book. It just wasn't my type. I couldn't get into it...maybe I'll try watching the movie instead...
152,153,1,Its not the genre that I like and its a book for children which is quite obvious from the way its written. I won't be trying to read it for a third time.
153,154,1,"3 stars --> 1 star
Because I can't like anything that supports a TERF agenda."
154,155,1,Changing my review because I found out the author is transphobic
155,156,1,"edited my star rating due to the author beinog a terf. also the books definetly dont deserve the rating they have, come one popele they're not that great"
156,157,1,"Unpopular opinion ):

I'm hoping the series picks up in action."

171,172,1,
172,173,1,"Av flere grunner endrer jeg min tidligere vurdering av denne boken. Det hjelper selvsagt ikke at forfatteren er transfobisk, men nå som nostalgiens briller har falt av så kan jeg ærlig innrømme at denne boken ikke er bra skrevet. Den var en del av barndommen min og jeg har derfor ikke dømt den like strengt som andre bøker, men etter å ha gått tilbake og prøvd å lese den på nytt så vet jeg med meg selv at det finnes bedre bøker som jeg mye heller vil lese."
173,174,1,"Sooooo, here’s the deal.

I know I promised glowing raves, but since Rowling blew her chances with those anti-trans tweets, I have no choice but to go back on my word. You’re probably wondering why I changed my ratings from five stars to one. There you go.

FYI, Rowling, you’re not the only one who can write your way out of poverty and drastically go from rags to riches by making something out of nothing.

With that out of the way, here’s how this is going to go down: Instead of singing the praises, I’m going to point out the less-than-perfect things…um, infractions, I guess you could say. I’m going to pull some of them from my bitch-review of THE MAZE RUNNER, because let’s face it, it’s not fair for Rowling to get off scot-free while Dashner gets chewed out. And other infractions will come up as I see fit.

So. The less-than-perfect things about Sorcerer’s Stone. Here we go.

Firstly: Improper use of commas. Not only did Hermione speak with comma splices when she’s supposed to be SMART, but also there were comma splices in the narration as well. Here are some examples:

[image error]

I suppose I can excuse characters speaking with comma splices if the narration is grammatically correct 24/7, but since that wasn’t the case here, I don’t know what to tell you.

The next thing is about the system of houses. No, I did not capitalize that (which I’ll come back to in a little bit). In the grand scheme of things, the houses are basically labeling people and shoving them in boxes based on their most prominent personality trait. Gryffindors are brave, Ravenclaws are smart, and according to Rowling, you can’t be both smart and brave at the same time—it’s one or the other. In addition, Slytherins are stereotyped as juvenile delinquents, and Hufflepuffs are stereotyped as tagalongs. I’m sure you’re all familiar with “cliques” in high school that consisted of cheerleaders, drama geeks, jocks, nerds, and so on. Well, this system of houses is in essence the same thing. Make what you will of that, audience.

Now back to capitalization. I guess I should be thankful that it wasn’t a case of Door and Pole and Map and Council and Banish and Ending and Hole and Dear God I Could Go On Forever, but and didn’t sit right with me. Also Switching Spells had the same effect. For some reason, Rowling loves to capitalize names of spells and charms, and I get that—at least to an extent. (Key words: .) But starting in Goblet of Fire, she starts to abuse that, and I’ll point it out accordingly when we get there.

I have one more infraction to point out, again a repeat from THE MAZE RUNNER, and that’s an overdose of dashes. I think Rowling considered a page wasted unless it had at least one dash, thus multiple dashes on one page. Here are some examples:





Please tell me that I’m not the only one who was rubbed the wrong way. I could go on forever, but I don’t want to bore you. Plus I’ll run out of room if I put every single dash here.

I’m finished with that segment of this review. I have one last thing to preach about before I call it a day. And that, my friends, is Thus far, the public has done a lousy job. According to a magazine article that I read last weekend, the fandom is still quote-unquote “healthy” or something along those lines. We need to change that. How, you ask? Well, the other day I ran across a blog post from The Gayly Prophet that detailed a list of ideas on how to shut down the fandom, and the ones that stood out to me were as follows:



I know what you’re thinking: “But she’s gonna go from riches back to rags.” And I’m aware of that. But think about this: Right now, this very minute, she’s using the dough that she makes from licensed merch to subsidize programs that are going to exterminate, so to speak, the trans population as if they’re termites. And if you don’t want that, don’t give her your money! Simple as that. If sending her back to poverty is the only way to get through to her, so be it.
Side note: It astonishes me, and not in a good way, that said licensed merch is still being made. Have the makers of plush toys, manufacturers of figurines, and authors of cookbooks and craft books learned ?
One more way that I contribute to the “cause” is to people mispronounce her name by saying “rowl” instead of “roll,” as opposed to correcting them. I used to correct people who butchered her name, but now I don’t bother. It's the least I can do.

And that concludes this portion of Rotten Tomatoes (but for books)."
174,175,1,"I loved what the book was going to be about!! I loved Harry's personality! I loved his backstory! I loved Ron and Hermione. So why didn't I like the book at all?
I couldn't finish this book. It's a shame, because I got the full series, and I literally can't finish it. It disappointed me."
175,176,1,soooo bad and cringe i felt like a 5 year old when i read it. What was ma girl thinking. Not a good start of your career sis. Maybe I am not quirky enough for this but nuhhh I liked the movie more (obviously).
176,177,1,"This book series was my childhood and the fandom is mostly wonderful, and honestly the book would normally be around 3 stars however due to the author being transph0bic, and most likely problematic/harmful to other minority groups, I won't rate it higher mostly as I don't support her actions.
The book itself is mostly great for nostalgic purposes, the world of Harry Potter is near to a lot of people's hearts and I grew up reading a lot of magical books like this series.
I just want to say if you like this book series I've nothing against it or you as this is a massive fandom and the series both in film and book has brought a lot of joy to many people. Just please try not to support authors that are discriminating against people, like Rowling has, pls and thanks :)"
177,178,1,"So there's like a boy wizard or something. Doesn't have enough guns, and is so boring. The guy with the demon I'm his back head is so weird and why does he think that's a good cosmetic choice. Also there's like a giant but he's not even that tall."

200,201,1,"There are plenty of fantasy authors who claim to be doing something different with the genre. Ironically, they often write the most predictable books of all, as evidenced by Goodkind and Paolini. Though I'm not sure why they protest so much--predictability is hardly a death sentence in genre fantasy.

The archetypal story of a hero, a villain, a profound love, and a world to be saved never seems to get old--it's a great story when it's told well. At the best, it's exciting, exotic, and builds to a fulfilling climax. At the worst, it's just a bloodless rehash. Unfortunately, the worst are more common by far.

Perhaps it was this abundance of cliche romances that drove Martin to aim for something different. Unfortunately, you can't just choose to be different, any more than you can choose to be creative. Sure, Moorcock's original concept for Elric was to be the anti-Conan, but at some point, he had to push his limits and move beyond difference for difference's sake--and he did.

In similar gesture, Martin rejects the allegorical romance of epic fantasy, which basically means tearing out the guts of the genre: the wonder, the ideals, the heroism, and with them, the moral purpose. Fine, so he took out the rollicking fun and the social message--what did he replace them with?

Like the post-Moore comics of the nineties, fantasy has already borne witness to a backlash against the upright, moral hero--and then a backlash against the grim antihero who succeeded him. Hell, if all Martin wanted was grim and gritty antiheroes in an amoral world, he didn't have to reject the staples of fantasy, he could have gone to its roots: Howard, Leiber, and Anderson.

Like many authors aiming for realism, he forgets 'truth is stranger than fiction'. The real world is full of unbelievable events, coincidences, and odd characters. When authors remove these elements in an attempt to make their world seem real, they make their fiction duller than reality; after all, unexpected details are the heart of verisimilitude. When Chekhov and Peake eschewed the easy thrill of romance, they replaced it with the odd and absurd--moments strange enough to feel true. In comparison, Martin's world is dull and gray. Instead of innovating new, radical elements, he merely removes familiar staples--and any style defined by lack is going to end up feeling thin.

Yet, despite trying inject the book with history and realism, he does not reject the melodramatic characterization of his fantasy forefathers, as evidenced by his brooding bastard antihero protagonist (with pet albino wolf). Apparently to him, 'grim realism' is 'Draco in Leather Pants'. This produces a conflicted tone: a soap opera cast lost in an existentialist film.

There's also lots of sex and misogyny, and 'wall-to-wall rape'--not that books should shy away from sex, or from any uncomfortable, unpleasant reality of life. The problem is when people who are not comfortable with their own sexuality start writing about it, which seems to plague every mainstream fantasy author. Their pen gets away from them, their own hangups start leaking into the scene, until it's not even about the characters anymore, it's just the author cybering about his favorite fetish--and if I cyber with a fat, bearded stranger, I expect to be paid for it.

I know a lot of fans probably get into it more than I do (like night elf hunters humping away in WOW), but reading Goodkind, Jordan, and Martin--it's like seeing a Playboy at your uncle's where all the pages are wrinkled. That's not to say there isn't serviceable pop fantasy sex out there--it's just written by women.

Though I didn't save any choice examples, I did come across this quote from a later book:
""... she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals. Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest . . .""

Imagine the process: Martin sits, hands hovering over the keys, trying to get inside his character's head:

""Okay, I'm a woman. How do I see and feel the world differently? My cultural role is defined by childbirth. I can be bought and sold in marriage by my own--Oh, hey! I've got tits! Man, look at those things go. *whooshing mammary sound effects* Okay, time to write.""

Where are the descriptions of variously-sized dongs swinging within the confines of absurdly-detailed clothing? There are a set of manboobs (which perhaps Martin has some personal experience with) but not until book five. Even then, it's not the dude being hyperaware of his own--they're just there to gross out a dwarf. Not really a balanced depiction.

If you're familiar with the show (and its parodies on South Park and SNL) this lack of dongs may surprise you. But as Martin himself explained, when asked why there's no gay sex in his books, despite having gay characters, 'they’re not the viewpoint characters'--as if somehow, the viewpoints he chooses to depict are beyond his control. Apparently, he plots as well as your average NaNoWriMo author: sorry none of my characters chose to be gay, nothing I can do about it.

And balance really is the problem here--if you only depict the dark, gritty stuff that you're into, that's not realism, it's just a fetish. If you depict the grimness of war by having every female character threatened with rape, but the same thing never happens to a male character, despite the fact that more men get raped in the military than women, then your 'gritty realism card' definitely gets revoked.

The books are notorious for the sudden, pointless deaths, which some suggest is another sign of realism--but, of course, nothing is pointless in fiction, because everything that shows up on the page is only there because the author put it there. Sure, in real life, people suddenly die before finishing their life's work (fantasy authors do it all the time), but there's a reason we don't tend to tell stories of people who die unexpectedly in the middle of things: they are boring and pointless. They build up for a while then eventually, lead nowhere.

Novelists often write in isolation, so it's easy to forget the rule to which playwrights adhere: your story is always a fiction. Any time you treat it as if it were real, you are working against yourself. The writing that feels the most natural is never effortless, it is carefully and painstakingly constructed to seem that way.

A staple of Creative Writing 101 is to 'listen to how people really talk', which is terrible advice. A transcript of any conversation will be so full of repetition, half-thoughts, and non-specific words ('stuff', 'thing') as to be incomprehensible--especially without the cues of tone and body language. Written communication has its own rules, so making dialogue feel like speech is a trick writers play. It's the same with sudden character deaths: treat them like a history, and your plot will become choppy and hard to follow.

Not that the deaths are truly unpredictable. Like in an action film, they are a plot convenience: kill off a villain, and you don't have to wrap up his arc. You don't have to defeat him psychologically--the finality of his death is the great equalizer. You skip the hard work of demonstrating that the hero was morally right, because he's the only option left.

Likewise, in Martin's book, death ties up loose threads--namely, plot threads. Often, this is the only ending we get to his plot arcs, which makes them rather predictable: any time a character is about to build up enough influence to make things better, or more stable, he will die. Any character who poses a threat to the continuing chaos which drives the action will first be built up, and then killed off.

I found this interview to be a particularly telling example of how Martin thinks of character deaths:
""I killed Ned because everybody thinks he’s the hero ... sure, he’s going to get into trouble, but then he’ll somehow get out of it. The next predictable thing [someone] is going to rise up and avenge his [death] ... So immediately [killing Robb] became the next thing I had to do.

He's not talking about the characters' motivations, or the ideas they represent, or their role in the story--he isn't laying out a well-structured plot, he's just killing them off for pure shock value.

Yet the only reason we think these characters are important in the first place is because Martin treats them as central heroes, spending time and energy building them. Then it all ends up being a red herring, a cheap twist, the equivalent of a horror movie jump scare. It's like mystery novels in the 70's, after all the good plots had been done, so authors added ghosts or secret twins in the last chapter--it's only surprising because the author has obliterated the story structure.

All plots are made up of arcs that grow and change, building tension and purpose. Normally, when an arc ends, the author must use all his skill to deal with themes and answer questions, providing a satisfying conclusion to a promising idea that his readers watched grow. Or just kill off a character central to the conflict and bury the plot arc with him. Then you don't have to worry about closure, you can just hook your readers by focusing on the mess caused by the previous arc falling apart. Make the reader believe that things might get better, get them to believe in a character, then wave your arms in distraction, point and yell 'look at that terrible thing, over there!', and hope they become so caught up in worrying about the new problem that they forget the old one was never resolved.

Chaining false endings together creates perpetual tension that never requires solution--like in most soap operas--plus, the author never has to do the hard work of finishing what they started. If an author is lucky, they die before reaching the Final Conclusion the readership is clamoring for, and never have to meet the collective expectation which long years of deferral have built up. It's easy to idolize Kurt Cobain, because you never had to see him bald and old and crazy like David Lee Roth.

Unlucky authors live to write the Final Book, breaking the spell of unending tension that kept their readers enthralled. Since the plot isn't resolving into a tight, intertwined conclusion (in fact, it's probably spiraling out of control, with ever more characters and scenes), the author must wrap things up conveniently and suddenly, leaving fans confused and upset. Having thrown out the grand romance of fantasy, Martin cannot even end on the dazzling trick of the vaguely-spiritual transgressive Death Event on which the great majority of fantasy books rely for a handy tacked-on climax (actually, he'll probably do it anyways, with dragons--the longer the series goes on, the more it starts to resemble the cliche monomyth that Martin was praised for eschewing in the first place).

The drawback is that even if a conclusion gets stuck on at the end, the story fundamentally leads nowhere--it winds back and forth without resolving psychological or tonal arcs. But then, doesn't that sound more like real life? Martin tore out the moralistic heart and magic of fantasy, and in doing so, rejected the notion of grandly realized conclusions. Perhaps we shouldn't compare him to works of romance, but to histories.

He asks us to believe in his intrigue, his grimness, and his amoral world of war, power, and death--not the false Europe of Arthur, Robin Hood, and Orlando, but the real Europe of plagues, political struggles, religious wars, witch hunts, and roving companies of soldiery forever ravaging the countryside. Unfortunately, he doesn't compare very well to them, either. His intrigue is not as interesting as Cicero's, Machiavelli's, Enguerrand de Coucy's--or even Sallust's, who was practically writing fiction, anyways. Some might suggest it unfair to compare a piece of fiction to a true history, but these are the same histories that lent Howard, Leiber, and Moorcock their touches of verisimilitude. Martin might have taken a lesson from them and drawn inspiration from further afield: even Tolkien had his Eddas. Despite being fictionalized and dramatized, Martin's take on The War of the Roses is far duller than the original.

More than anything, this book felt like a serial melodrama: the hardships of an ensemble cast who we are meant to watch over and sympathize with, being drawn in by emotional appeals (the hope that things will 'get better' in this dark place, 'tragic' deaths), even if these appeals conflict with the supposed realism, and in the end, there is no grander story to unify the whole. This 'grittiness' is just Martin replacing the standard fantasy theme of 'glory' with one of 'hardship', and despite flipping this switch, it's still just an emotional appeal. 'Heroes always win' is just as blandly predictable as 'heroes always lose'.

It's been suggested that I didn't read enough of Martin to judge him, but if the first four hundred pages aren't good, I don't expect the next thousand will be different. If you combine the three Del Rey collections of Conan The Barbarian stories, you get 1,263 pages (including introductions, end notes, and variant scripts). If you take Martin's first two books in this series, you get 1,504 pages. Already, less than a third of the way into the series, he's written more than Howard's entire Conan output, and all I can do is ask myself: why does he need that extra length?

A few authors use it to their advantage, but for most, it's just sprawling, undifferentiated bloat. Melodrama can be a great way to mint money, as evidenced by the endless 'variations on a theme' of soap operas, pro wrestling, and superhero comics. People get into it, but it's neither revolutionary nor realistic. You also hear the same things from the fans: that it's all carefully planned, all interconnected, all going somewhere. Apparently they didn't learn their lesson from the anticlimactic fizzling out of Twin Peaks, X-Files, Lost, and Battlestar. Then again, you wouldn't keep watching if you didn't think it was going somewhere.

Some say 'at least he isn't as bad as all the drivel that gets published in genre fantasy', but saying he's better than dreck is really not very high praise. Others have intimated that I must not like fantasy at all, pointing to my low-star reviews of Martin, Wolfe, Jordan, and Goodkind, but it is precisely because I am passionate about fantasy that I fall heavily on these authors.

A lover of fine wines winces the more at a corked bottle of vinegar, a ballet enthusiast's love of dance would not leave him breathless at a high school competition--and likewise, having learned to appreciate epics, histories, knightly ballads, fairy tales, and their modern offspring in fantasy, I find Martin woefully lacking. There's plenty of grim fantasy and intrigue out there, from its roots to the dozens of fantasy authors, both old and modern, whom I list in the link at the end of this review

There seems to be a sense that Martin's work is somehow revolutionary, that it represents a 'new direction' for fantasy, but all I see is a reversion. Sure, he's different than Jordan, Goodkind, and their ilk, who simply took the pseudo-medieval high-magic world from Tolkien and the blood-and-guts heroism from Howard. Martin, on the other hand, has more closely followed Tolkien's lead than any other modern high fantasy author--and I don't just mean in terms of racism.

Tolkien wanted to make his story real--not 'realistic', using the dramatic techniques of literature--but actually real, by trying to create all the detail of a pretend world behind the story. Over the span of the first twenty years, he released The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and other works, while in the twenty years after that, he became so obsessed with worldbuilding for its own sake that instead of writing stories, he filled his shed with a bunch of notes (which his son has been trying to make a complete book from ever since).

It's the same thing Martin's trying to do: cover a bland story with a litany of details that don't contribute meaningfully to his characters, plot, or tone. So, if Martin is good because he is different, then it stands to reason that he's not very good, because he's not that different. He may seem different if all someone has read is Tolkien and the authors who ape his style, but that's just one small corner of a very expansive genre. Anyone who thinks Tolkien is the 'father of fantasy' doesn't know enough about the genre to judge what 'originality' means.

So, if Martin neither an homage nor an original, I'm not sure what's left. In his attempt to set himself apart, he tore out the joyful heart of fantasy, but failed replace it with anything. There is no revolutionary voice here, and there is nothing in Martin's book that has not been done better by other authors.

However, there is one thing Martin has done that no other author has been able to do: kill the longrunning High Fantasy series. According to some friends of mine in publishing (and some on-the-nose remarks by Caleb Carr in an NPR interview on his own foray into fantasy), Martin's inability to deliver a book on time, combined with his strained relationship with his publisher means that literary agents are no longer accepting manuscripts for high fantasy series--even from recognized authors. Apparently, Martin is so bad at plot structure that he actually pre-emptively ruined books by other authors. Perhaps it is true what they say about silver linings . . .

Though I declined to finish this book, I'll leave you with a caution compiled from various respectable friends of mine who did continue on:

""If you need some kind of closure, avoid this series. No arcs will ever be completed, nothing will ever really change. The tagline is 'Winter is Coming'--it's not. As the series goes on, there will be more and more characters and diverging plotlines to keep track of, many of them apparently completely unrelated to each other, even as it increasingly becomes just another cliche, fascist 'chosen one' monomyth, like every other fantasy series out there. If you enjoy a grim, excessively long soap opera with lots of deaths and constant unresolved tension, pick up the series--otherwise, maybe check out the show."""

2008: i wanted to see what all the fuss was about so flicked through at least one of the books, watched a few movies, and then eventual decided I’d better read at least one book so my dislike of Rowlings style of writing wizard books would be founded on, ‘Yes, i have read the book.’
I’m in the minority: not.a.fan!
The writing style and storyline reminded me of a (poorly crafted) version of Enid Blyton meets Roald Dahl."

Not to mention the consistency of the white washing throughout all of the books, I'm still a fan of the universe though and hp will always be apart of my identity."
214,215,1,"to start this unnecessarily verbose rant review - Joane Rowling is an active radically transphobic ""feminist"" whose political beliefs have been recognizable in several of her books, essays, commentaries for reproducing stereotypes as racist/discriminatory, fatphobic, sexist, homophobic bigotry. there are some fans with the widespread opinion to simply separate the art from the artist or as long as you don't support the author financially, you don't have to care about her as a person - but these concepts only work if said author has long since died or the art is not influenced by the issues mentioned.
her “activism” sponsors far-right british hate organizations, therefore: support trans activism, there are better fantasy stories without alt right authors.

I've wondered for quite some time now what exactly has triggered the massive appeal to “Harry Potter”, because the first two books are definitely filled with lousy writing , neither rich in fantastic language, nor creativity, nor outstanding world building.
my personal hypothesis is, “Harry Potter” is particularly popular with white middle-class Brits, was also written from the point of view of one and thereby appealed to quite a lot of children/young adolescent, as it massively incorporated their society & landscape into its worldbuilding.
the magic system/worldbuilding, is dull, superficial and therefore easy conceivable, appealing to a young readership to get caught up in this world and create a large fanon, if only because of the many unanswered questions, the undeveloped characters and the lack of diversity.

Rowling was also lucky with her release date, coming out at a time when predominantly millennials were hungry for more escapism, and merch waiting to be sold exponentially. It features the cliche fairytale plotline, rather popular in the UK, with a child accidentally thrown into a magical world, growing in to the heroic path as told in countless stories before.
Furthermore, voices have often been raised, Rowling could have plagiarized other stories. ""Tom Brown's School Days"" e.g., in which, Tom Brown reads like a template for Harry's character, the private school experiences and the connections to the school principal as well, also N.K. Stoufler's ""The Legend of Rah and the Muggles"", Adrian Jacobs, inspirations from the Charlie Bone series etc.

it seems almost laughable in retrospect what level of glorification Rowling received, the many interviews and articles that portrayed her as a depressed woman who saved herself from poverty and welfare aid and made herself a self-made millionaire. fun fact: Rowling wrote most of the first book at Nicholson's Cafe, a cafe where she could sit and write mostly for free because it belonged to her brother in law.

the writing style is mainly aimed at 5-7 year olds, no complex language structure, very paratactic sentences and the motifs clash with the writing style because both are so paradoxically opposed. the motives too complex, the writing style too simple.

quite the first thing we're told is that the Dursleys are mean, conservative people who despise everything strange and will treat them accordingly. Hogwarts Professor McGonagall is assigned to spy on these non-magical relatives to see if Harry will be safe there. Not only, she then warns Dumbledore not to leave Harry there (a little baby laying on the doorstep for hours on a loud, cold October/November night), but through the tales of Harry's childhood the abuse is repeatedly shown eventually both parents encouraging their child to abuse him as well.
this leaves two options, either Dumbledore is secretly a really bad person, ignoring child abuse with phrases like ""it's his family"" and the protection spell securing the home, which certainly wasn't just invented by Rowling as an excuse to perpetuate Harry's tragic background, or Rowling made zero effort to think about Dumbledore's character. For he is presented to us as an incredibly intelligent, sensitive and complex human being while constantly ignoring the best interests of children, gradually increasing book by book.
another thing that struck me in this scene, Sirius Black gets introduced for lending Hagrid his beloved bike, which should already be a hint to those around him that he puts Harry's safety before anything, and yet everyone believes he is guilty & insane later on?

Now there are bound to be some who will claim that due to Harry's identity and determination as ""the chosen one"" he was given this background to remain down to earth as a character, to show that bad things had been done to him and yet he was not like Voldemort. As if the trauma of losing your parents shouldnt already provide enough down-to-earthness and empathy.While we're at it, empathy doesn't have to be learned through terrible experiences, it's a basic human concept that everyone should possess.

Harry, a young boy who has known Hagrid for a few moments, follows the sinister man who just demoted another child with magic which he is not allowed to use, into a magical world he has never encountered. Hagrid, denied so much knowledge, that he cannot offer any advice, and only about halfway explain the story of his parents' murder to him is his “safe person” now.
Even when arriving Hogwarts, the touted ""safest and best"" place in the world/wizard world, we experience nothing but perpetual danger and ridiculous classes.
Hogwarts would be the worst place for children, and even with the obvious issues (accessible dark magic, lack of control over faculties, the forbidden forest / lake inhabited by murderous creatures, the complete isolation). These children don't learn anything remotely important about surviving in the magical world, the most unnecessary topics will be explained in length tho.
you want to tell me that there is only one sport for which they sit on a crumbling broom for a single year and then never again because flying is actually the worst means of transport, they don't learn a single language although there are countless in the magical world. There are creatures they interact with (well, mostly other creatures are in a slave position or ""employees"" and are treated as lesser creatures, so again that's self-explanatory), the only two subjects that would be important to survival would be above all potions (which is taught by a biased incel who favors/humiliates students to the point of being their greatest fear), or either charms or transfigurations, depending on your perspective. The kids are seriously learning how to turn animals into needles rather than anything important, even in history class, which should be important for anyone who wants/needs to work in e.g. the ministry afterwards, is apparently an incredibly boring subject thought by a ghost that definitely isn't going approach to issues progressive, which could be part of the reason no one in the world cares, why wizards are the most conceited and racist beings, and oppress every other life form. But well, that is sufficiently discussed in the third, fourth, fifth and seventh book and nobody seems to be interested in it until today.

Another question that came to my mind as I read this was whether these children, especially those from wizarding families, had ever seen some form of primary school or kindergarten before? Are elves just their nannies too, does everyone get home schooled? How on earth do wizarding kids get along in the world afterwards when they obviously lack basic brain-developing structures in early childhood?
Also strange within the magic system is that kids are obviously capable of doing magic without spoken spells like when Harry grows his hair, they can use magic as kids, but as they get older it's considered very complicated, very difficult to learn and rare possibility to cast magic?

another example for poor writing is Ron's introspection, in which he often perceives himself as some kind of failure lacking success, only owing hand me downs. however, he does not outgrow the chess scene in the next six books and is often described as merely a ""dumb appendage"".

Something that bothered me whilst reading about Filch, regarding Hogwarts in relation to magic genetics as well as class society. It should not be forgotten that these issues can also affect children, as we see rather often with the Weasleys.
It is explained to us early on that the ""pureblood"" families have resorted to incest to keep the magical bloodline ""pure/magical"" and therefore consider themselves superior to non-magical people (we're briefly disregarding how underdeveloped the wizarding world is and that mage arrogance has probably caused their superiority to be largely a myth of their world, since humans have had to evolve for years to survive, and the wizarding world have used far too few possibilities, also die genetics explained by Rowling being a mess).
Why can't Squibs attend Hogwarts? The whole magical world is pure discrimination, it's so sad. Squibs are still capable of a lot of magical things, their magical powers for casting spells just aren't usually as strong. However, they often still live in magical villages or, like Filch, have jobs in the magical world. Basically they are the magical world's metaphor for physical/mental handicapped people. But there are still a lot of things that Squibs should probably learn, a good example being a history class or an animal class. Imagine you are part of the world, you live in the world, but literally anything can kill you, you are constantly in need of someone to somehow show/teach/do it for you just because you were never allowed , the only school that teaches you survival to attend.
also why even categorize children into main character, smart, dumb and evil? like you really thought hating on children for seven years and characterizing them as evil wouldn't turn out bad?

also: why would magicians choose capitalism? if i can already create most of it myself if I “transform” it, why should you spend money? and why is one forced to pursue a job if there is no real economy? the only job perspective there is, is the ministry, shop owner or the hospital, rare magicians like Newt Scamander travel around as zoologist, but apparently there doesn't seem to be a college, no really diverse labor market, and the money relations are totally nonsensical anyway (e.g. the candy trolley, the Nimbus,...), the ministry workers earn below the minimum wage…but I keep wondering why mage society is organized like this in the first place. In fact everyone except Squibs gets the same schooling, potentially has the same magical abilities, it's not like the Blacks or Malfoys should be powerful because of their magic or money, but they are in canon.

Money is gold in this world, controlled by a group, the goblins. I'll get to the anti-semitism later, but the fact that the phrase alone doesn't evoke at least a little wonder in readers makes me more concerned for humanity than I ever wanted to be.
But their whole system is run by wizard cops and yes that sounds similar to our world, but it makes very little sense why a magical much smaller world should work like that. For reference, Hogwarts has about 40 students per year, so you could add up Hogwarts magicians to about 300 people, let's say everyone has a large family, but not everyone has a magical one and certainly people without children, then we come to about 1000-1500 people within the UK wizarding community, their capitalist system would result in a huge underclass and high ministry figures/rich pureblood families & a few goblins holding all power. But then again, I have to ask myself, why the hell hasn't this been criticized before? Of course, this can now be explained with Rowling's lack of class consciousness and neoliberal attitude, but purely story-wise it makes little sense, for example for the Weasleys to simply accept that their very small world as unfair and classistic.
And for someone like Harry, who grew up with nothing and got rich suddenly, who's been labeled as altruistic, it's rather illogical that he never once takes any action. And from the entire book series plus, sadly canon, also Cursed Child, we know that despite his adolescence, Harry simply becomes a politicalist/auror and doesn't make a difference in the world but maintains the status quo.
Probably one of the few good things about this book was Harry's interactions with Neville and Luna, partly because they portray his character quite well, being sensitive and altruistic even as a boy, judgment-free and actually standing up for friends. On the other hand, it then makes even less sense to me how disinterested Harry is in part in this world and its system. Rowling has created the most apolitical character of a magical world ever, he has ""bloodtraitor"" friends and relatives, rebels against fascist structures, against a blood surpremacist, has all these great character traits, but at the end of the day it's the same boy who complains about Hermione's activism, the same boy who fails at his discrimination against Kreacher, the same boy who starts working at the ministry and adopts the ethics of every neoliberal as if he forgot the last twenty years of his life.

Now coming to my favorite potholes, and I don't have the energy to explain them all just because millennial potterheads can't read another book:
Quirrel touches Harry's hand in the pub early in the book and nothing happens, but by this point Voldemort is already part of Quirrel, and Harry has carried his mother's love with him since her death. Why?

Why is Dumbledore leaving school at all, he could have sent an owl? Why is he flying, he could have apparated, floo powder, used a patronus? Why doesn't the apparently smartest man in this book series think?

the stone was safe without Harry, Quirrel could have waited in front of the mirror for eternity, nobody evil would have gotten it, and why go through all this trouble in the first place?

How did Charlie's friends get to Hogwarts in the first place? No seriously, almost every book tells us how impossible it is to just walk in at Hogwarts and these young people just visit the astronomy tower?

Why doesn't Hagrid hand it over to Charlie's friends himself?and his sentimental attitude is no excuse, how irresponsible is it to leave 10-11 year olds with a dragon and random grown ups at night?

Why did Hermione even claim she went after the troll, instead of just lying about going to the bathroom?

Who came up with the Quidditch system and why didn't anyone think about the points for the snitch? cause the point system makes no sense.

Why is love established as a powerful magical trait that Harry can obviously channel, but it's never mentioned again? Never used again? Never part of the magic system again?

On the one hand there are the goblins, with their long fingers, pointed crooked noses, who hoard the money, have goatees, are greedy and are always plotting conspiracies. Ah right, where was the last time I heard that? Was it Fox News or the history class that Rowling obviously didn't take?
There are more references throughout the course of the book series that the goblins can be traced back to anti-semitic stereotypes via various artifacts or behaviors, and as referenced above, that's especially great when none of the magical children are ever educated about oppression. The kids are even made aware of the goblin riots, werewolf “etiquette”, etc. in history class, but I doubt Rowling has ever heard of institutional racism and accordingly I highly doubt any criticism is taught.

the fatphobia in this book was disturbing, it's not just one silly comment, it's several pages long when it comes to the Dursleys, detailing “how ugly and terribly fat” they're. take this as a reminder of respect and that when writing ""evil"" characters, they are usually characterized by evil actions, evil motives, not by : ""a missing neck"", ""forbidden dick"" (Hagrid), ""sports hater"", ""four times as wide"", the entire description of dudley's face, ""a pudding of a son"", dudley literally getting hexed to have a pigs tail, and the list goes further.

Quirrel's smelling turban under which evil hides
(no words left)

The whole house elf thing, ""but they like it,"" so it's normal to keep them as slaves. We get numerous sections detailing how much decorations, food, cleaning elves have to do, and no one, not a single kid is saying thanks? or maybe criticizing the slave situation?

The naming of the characters who are either not white or at least supposed to be “non-British” like Cho Chang, Seamus Finnigan, Anthony Goldstein, Kingsely Shacklebolt, Padma Patil,...
I think there are already a lot of articles online on why this is almost cartoonishly ridiculous underlying racism, but it's not just the naming, it's their behaviors/characteristics that fall so much into the typical categories.
It's lazy, bad writing, not to educate yourself or bother.
and I cannot be bothered to write about this atrocious book series any longer even tho I didn't mention so much more."

The films have become part of our culture. Throughout my whole life I was made to sit through them all time after time after time, and they were so BORING. I couldn't understand the appeal around them. It was always being shoved in my face, merch everywhere, the films always on, the one book everyone compared all other books to, the essential books, the books you had to read, the books that got everyone into reading... and I didn't understand it.
I felt like the only person in the world who felt like this.
When I told other people I didn't like Harry Potter they'd look at me like I'd just confessed to murder. You just weren't allowed to dislike Harey Potter. I was genuinely bullied for my dislike of it.

In 2016, I decided to give the book a chance. I'd read many incredible books with awful adaptations, maybe I'd like the book better.

I DNF'd it. I couldn't stand it, it was uninteresting, boring, unappealing. It gave me a headache, trying to push through this god awful book was excruciating.

I had learned my lesson at this point and hardly ever told anyone that I didn't like these films nor the first book, and didn't plan to read the rest. I was genuinely scared of people's reactions.

I googled it to see if there was something wrong with me. Lo and behold, THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO FELT THE SAME WAY AS ME!!!!
I was ecstatic. I wasn't alone. While I could only find one or two YouTube videos on people explaining why they didn't like Harry Potter for many of the same reasons as me, and not a single Goodreads review - I was happy. I was part of a very very small minority, but I was happy.

Nowadays we are quite a bit less stupid and accept that people have likes and dislikes different to us and that's fine (a lot of HP fans are still quite defensive though), and I just decided to go about my life liking other books and not caring what other people thought about me disliking this franchise.

Then, J.K. Rowling turned out to be a piece of shit. I didn't like her work, but I could at least respect her as a person... that was until she turned out to be a sick, disgusting, TERF.

I watched this destroy HP for so many people. And I felt bad, I knew what it was like to love something so deeply and I wouldn't want it ripped away from me like this.

Some people have chosen to separate the artist from the art - still enjoy the books, but not support J.K. herself - not promote or encourage the reading of her books or buying of her merch in any way, buying the books second hand, just making it clear that while the content is enjoyable for them and ultimately important in our culture, the creator is a horrible person who deserves no support. And this is completely fine, I've had to do this before with books and TV shows and music where I love it, it's become a part of me, or it's so important... but someone involved in it is disgusting, and I have to support their work and not them. This is okay. You are not supporting transphobia if you like Harry Potter. You are supporting transphobia if you like J.K. Rowling.

The thing that upsets me is people who used to love Harry Potter quickly doing a 180 and saying ""well I never even liked it anyway"", while their walls are still plastered in posters and their signed DVD is on a gold podium. I got bullied by people like you for saying what you just said and now you're going to pretend you're the same as me? That upsets me.

Anyway. I digress. I've never liked this franchise. I never will. You're welcome to like it. Rowling is a cunt. Support your local trans folks. Stay hydrated."

4 ⭐️

Weirdly enough, despite being a potterhead, this was only the third time I was reading Philosopher's Stone. I first read it 17 years ago, after my cousin recommended it to the whole family and we took turns reading the books. If you know me, you know that - like many young people when this book came out - I was 11 when I read it. Which gave another dimension to the whole getting-a-Hogwarts-letter thing. Then, after having seen all the movies multiple times, I read it again in 2016 when Bloomsbury released the new editions in time for Cursed Child. So this is the third time, and yet I managed to be surprised all over again.

For starters, I didn't remember just how much this book was written for children. It's funny, because JK Rowling took in account the fact that her readers would grow up reading her books. There's a huge difference in the writing between the first and the fifth book. So reading the first book again felt a bit childish, but in a good way, because it represents Harry's youth.

But reading a childhood favourite doesn't mean I went over every plot hole blindly. And there are quite a few. Such as the Brazilian snake which was bred in captivity in the UK, yet has a Portuguese accent. Or Harry's bedroom (Dudley's second bedroom) suddenly not being his anymore. Or the keys being on the girls toilets' lock on Halloween (1. why is there a lock? 2. why are the keys there?)...

I also noted for the first time that there seem to be some fat-shaming going on. The way Rowling describes the Dursleys compared to how she describes Molly Weasley si drastically different. She spends a lot more time describing Dudley's fatness while she skims over Molly's weight. In a way, Dudley and Vernon being fat (along with Dudley's friends) becomes a synonym of them being mean to Harry.

Funnily enough, some of the plot holes and problems where resolved in the movie. It might not have been the best (it's in my own bottom three) but it did have some things going for it.

I didn't love it as much as had as a child, but then again it has never been my favourite book in the series (I much prefer Prisoner of Azkaban)."

233,234,1,"harry potter was BORING, it was stupid and british and ugly, and the author looks like carl azuz but Carl azuz is graat. now. the author is a little bitch lokking like a shit stain on my floor"
234,235,1,"This is a tricky book to review, because it's so much more than just a book at this point. It's an entry point into a much larger literary world, and as such it has become a cultural and generational touchstone. That's unfair on a couple levels I think; it's unfair to the book because it becomes subject to heightened scrutiny that no author's first novel really deserves, and it's unfair to the reader because in order to verse yourself in the shared vocabulary of the series' huge, devoted readership you are expected to start by slogging through this volume or else not bother.

To be blunt, this isn't a very good book. That doesn't mean it's as bad as Harold Bloom (for some reason, the featured review on this page) thinks, and it doesn't mean it doesn't have any value; I'm just suggesting that this is an admirable but flawed first attempt at a novel. While later Harry Potter offerings at least attempt to grapple with complex issues that any teenager will face and resolutions that come packed with hard truths, this one is all puff and wish fulfillment. The writing is immature and bottoms out near the end when the author can't find a better segue than a paragraph that simply says ""And speaking of Snape...""

Basically, this is a bad Harry Potter book to start the series on. Have you ever tried to get someone hooked on a show you love, but you don't show them the pilot because you have a great episode in mind and you think it's more important to get them hooked on what makes the show great rather than forcing them to experience sequentially? That's where I'm going with this. If you're looking to get into this series, or trying to get a reluctant friend into the series, try Book 3 or 4 first, after the series has and come back to this one when you want to fill in the gaps. The later books are just going to repeat all the important stuff anyway."
235,236,1,"I am infamous amongst my friends and relatives for my dislike of Harry Potter and it has not won me any friends, let me tell you. I'm going to bet this review isn't exactly going to endear me to you, but I feel like my point needs to be heard. Don't we all, in the end?
I don't, when all is said and done, hate this book, nor any of the others in the series. They're okay books. I wouldn't say they were amazing, or that they changed my life or anything like that, but I enjoyed them well enough when I was younger.
What annoys me, what drives me round the bend and makes me want to tear my hair out is the adoration with which people treat Harry Potter today. What annoys me is grown adults talking about how great these books are and how much they love the characters. Maybe I just don't understand it, but I feel like better characters, better plots and a more interesting narrative can be found elsewhere. It's not as if they're even the best books in their field. Or at least that's my opinion.
If Harry Potter's still your favourite book after so long you need to read some better books. Each book you read should be your favourite until you move on to the next, each a unique experience which endeavours to outshines all its fellows in the sky. At the end of the day, you shouldn't be able to distinguish the stars from the heavens' blinding radiance.
There, I said it. Grumpy cynic that I am. If you love these books please ignore me. If they're not your favourites but you still like them feel free to laugh at my presumption. But please if you ever think of what books to give your children think on this. There are better books out there. There are books of magic and fantasy that are better written and much less predictable. I say from personal experience that a childhood that hasn't had Terry Pratchett in it by thirteen is a wasted one. Maybe that's just me though."
236,237,1,"When harry was a baby voldemort killed his parents but didn't kill harry. He lived with his aunt and uncle. They treated him very poorly. For 11 years he put up with the abuse of his aunt and uncle.Until he got a letter from hogwarts where he learned he was a wizard.He ends up in the house gryffindor. He found flying a special talent of his.he Played quidditch a sport at hogwarts. The philosopher's stone that grants people immortality. Harry suspects that snape is trying to get that stone to return voldemort back to his form. When harry gets a hold of the stone voldemort tries to trick him into giving him the stone by saying he will bring back his parents.quirrel tries to attack harry for the stone but when harry touches him he turns to dust.
A lot of people really enjoyed this book. They do say that it’s not the best one out of the series. They say it is slow at first when harry is at his uncles and it doesn’t really get interesting to read till the end. I would agree with them. On some things. Me personally I didn’t enjoy the book. They said that the characters and story was interesting. But i’m not super into these kinds of books. I do agree that the book starts out slow and it was really hard to get into at first.
I didn’t like this book for many reasons one being it was extremely slow and hard to get into and two I got so confused with the names of the people and actually the writing because they were names i've never heard before so it was hard to keep up with when they said a name. And I couldn’t really understand the story line. It’s not the type of book I would typically read but it was ok i guess."
237,238,1,"I'm into the fantasy genre, and as a kid I loved British fantasy series for children -- such as the Prydain Chronicles, the Chronicles of Narnia, The Hobbit, and even stuff like the 70s BBC television show The Phoenix and the Carpet. I thought for sure that I would enjoy Harry Potter as well...

But alas, no. It just didn't capture my imagination at all, and frankly, I don't really understand the hype and craze. I found this book to be dull -- in fact, I had to force myself to finish it, to give it a ""fair chance."" I was not inspired enough to read any more of the series.

I'm almost embarrassed to admit it, because I know absolutely everyone loves this series -- but I'm sorry, I just have to be honest. I'm not just being a contrarian ""hater,"" really! I am glad, though, that it has enjoyed popularity and brought fantasy novels back into the spotlight; because I am sure it has spurred sales of many books I like. (And if not for Harry Potter, would we have such great Narnia films in production right now? Probably not.)

This was definitely one of those extremely rare times that I enjoyed the film more than the book! I've continued to enjoy all of the Harry Potter movies, but even so, none have excited me enough to make me feel a desire to go back and read the rest of this series; I'm content to enjoy the films and leave it at that."
238,239,1,"The first book in the series is good enough but HP and the Stone sets an ugly precedent for the rest of the series. Perhaps there's only one or three incredibly convenient coincidences in the first book but by the end of the series everything that happens is through a stroke of fortune. Harry is always in the right place at the right time to overhear an important conversation.

There's too much magic which has no explicit rules. It's like a poker game which allows ""round the corner straight"" and a bunch of additional weirdness. J.K. Rowling makes the rules of magic and they always favor Harry. Worse yet, J.K. Rowling is still explaining how the Elder Wand changes allegiance. It sounds like if Harry had clobbered Malfoy on the head with a frying pan, that would have been enough.

And this book starts with the lame cliche of leaving a baby on the doorstep. I suppose the note they left starts ""Dear Petunia, your sister is dead."" Am I the only person in the world who notices these things? Why doesn't Dumbledore magically make the Dursleys believe this is Dudley's brother? Hermione was able to manipulate her parent's memories after all. But that would get in the way of the ""poor, wretched, abused Harry"" storyline. Why doesn't Hermione magically modify Harry's memories so he believes his parents have moved to Australia?"
239,240,1,"I liked it at the beginning, but then I found it quite boring, whatever, it's just a child book.

I really don't care what's going to happen in the next books and it would be for the best if Harry dies, yes, he's got a bad childhood and no upbringing because he was an orphan, but in the end he turns out to be a genius at this game called Quidditch and a brave mage, everything goes well for him. Eleven years of continuous suffering with his muggle relatives and then on his eleventh birthday a giant pays him a visit to tell him a beautiful truth: you're a wizard, Harry and you're famous in the magic world, and even rich thanks to your inheritance.
Life solved, not even you-know-who seems like a menace when you're a rich genius famous mage talented great athlete boy. I wanted him to suffer more, what is this crap? Fuck him, he’s even got friends from the beginning of his journey. This book is boring because you know that nothing bad would happen to him, the other characters are pretty simple, basically, Harry and his friends are the muggles of the magic world, because they’re the same pathetic pieces of shit that you find in the real world, with no personality at all, simple minded humans, like everyone in this fuckin book, a caricature of friendship and hardship, that’s Harry Potter and the philosophers stone: characters with fakes personalities."
240,241,1,"Warning: swearing to follow!

I avoided these books like the fucking PLAGUE when I was younger, tho I was in the target demographic when they first came out. Just to be contrary, I think. 🤪

So I’ve only just finally read this for the first time at 32.

They bugged me!

The fat shaming was AWFUL. Yes yes whatshisface was an entitled spoiled asshole and his parents were abusive jerks. So why FAT SHAME? Why not just fucking shame them for the traits that are actually awful?! Fuck. Insert many eye rolls.

Also casual ableism GALORE.

Also. The turban. Racist much?

And I gotta say I found Harry and Ron to be annoying. I found the way they treated Hermione especially grating. That was friendship?! They were constantly making fun of her?! Ugh!

And am I the only one who found Harry’s change in demeanour from “home” to school to be very sudden? I mean, he was essentially abused for 10ish years?! And once he learns he’s infamous and adored by a bunch of strangers it’s all okay and he can just flick the well- adjusted switch? Im unconvinced.

Buried under all those frustrations- the plot and the world were interesting. I’ll probably read the next one, just too see. Before I read this one, I had been considering reading them with my kids eventually, but I’m not sure about that anymore. It would require a lot of side discussions about the problems in it, that’s for sure."
241,242,1,"I had heard all the hype, and my daughter's best friend was so into this book. I had to see what all the fuss was about, so while the class I was subbing was at PE, I picked up the copy that was on the regular teacher's desk and began to read. After about 50 pages, I put it down and started doing all kinds of mental exercises to clear my head of the rubbish before the kids came back.

I had never in my life read more depressing, dark, disgusting drivel. For the life of me, I have no idea what all the fuss is about or why JK Rowling is given such undeserved praise. There are so many good stories out there like the Narnia series, Lord of the Rings, and the writings of Alexandre Dumas if you like adventure. For more kid-friendly vocabulary, read Coraline, Ella Enchanted, anything by Beverly Cleary, the Alex Rider series, but fortheluvvaMike, let this garbage die a slow ignominious death. Harry's 15 minutes of fame are SO over!

I refuse to stock any Harry Potter books in my classroom, and will never recommend reading this trash, although I do not keep students from bringing in their own. Just don't try to interest me in it. Been there, done that, want my brain cells back."
242,243,1,"The start of a cult. We now have a theme park built in worship to Hogwarts. Millions of children lied about their eye sight to wear glasses like Rowling's perfect better-than-Christ Harry. Scientology lead the way and Potter will follow. Burn this occult brain washing text should your child believe brooms are involved in sports. With subtle nods pointing to owl gods lording over even the special ones. Racism against the common man, disgustingly referred to as Muggles, creates a one room utopia in the childlike mind of the reader. A study conducted at the towering height of Potter fever concluded loner students researched and created potion concoctions to defend themselves from bullying enemies. These magic spells unearthed themselves as acid attacks. Subsequent subjects spread the gospel according to Dumbledore to disgruntled youth who practiced the violent terror depicted in this book (I couldn't stomach reading anymore sequels) across the country. The fall of civilization can be traced directly to these volatile thinly disguised manifestos of a mad devil worshiper. Hogwarts is sure to join the nontaxable giants in the coming years. It's too late to stop this juggernaut of jaundice despair."
243,244,1,"No this did not make it to the list because it overshadowed the much better warrior cats series that was coming out around the same time, and because I desperately wished my childhood was one filled with furries vying for political supremacy and control over natural resources, instead of snot-nosed-brats running around with broom sticks waving a wooden phallus at me screaming incantations and expecting me to drop dead. This series made it onto the list because I was so excited to read a flippin 7 book epic on a ceramicist who struggles with body image. Maybe I allow too many of my interests to be influenced by “Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo,” but hey, I do, and I’m tired of pretending to be ashamed about it. For real though, wouldn’t you have rather read a story of a hairy beast learning to love themselves and realize the very thing that alienated them from society, gave them the ability to throw the most beautiful pieces of pottery anyone had ever seen? And then society has to take a good hard look at their own reflection and re-envision what they thought of as ugly as beautiful, and beautiful as ugly? If not, then you can wingaridum-leave-me-the-fuck-alone.

244,245,1,i really do love harry potter and i think that the book was good but we don’t support transphobic and problematic authors in this household 😌💅 but it’s ok cuz it was daniel radcliffe who wrote the books 🤠
245,246,1,"I recently re-read this with a client, despite saying I wouldn't return to this series again. The client's joy and nostalgia felt worth it. As we listened to the audiobook together, I could still see what draws people to this book series. There are problematic elements in this first book--fatphobia, stereotypes. But to be honest even knowing now what I do about the author, those elements didn't feel like they detracted too much from the core story and characters.

If this is a comfort read for you, I understand. If this world means a lot to you, I get it.

Here are ways to consume a problematic book series without giving money to its author:
1) Borrow the books from someone.
2) Get the downloads of a book from a friend (see #2).
3) Buy from local used book stores.
If these don't work, these options are better than nothing:
4) Borrow from libraries.
5) Buy used books online--and use smaller retailers first.

While in general I discourage advertising for a series that's problematic, if you still want merchandise with HP stuff on it, buy fanart from Etsy and online. Get knock-offs. Create your own."
246,247,1,"I revived a copy of this book on my fourth birthday and had it read aloud to me by my mother. My four year old self was enchanted. For the next several years of my life, Harry Potter was an obsession of mine. These books were what really got me interested in reading. I recently re-read the series and suffice to say, it did not live up to my expectations. After a while, you felt as if a ten year old could write it better and Harry was 10x more annoying than I remembered him. I am also just fed-up with all the hype over it even fourteen years after its publication. I mean, people, get a life and stop obsessing over this stupid as all get out book. But still, part of me still wants to be a four year old kid, utterly enchanted by this world, waiting with bated breath for the night to come again so my mom could read aloud to me again. But, I can't reverse time, and I can't make myself like this book anymore. To put things quite simply, this book sucks ass. Do not, under any curcumstances read this crappy book."
247,248,1,"The Harry Potter books hold a near and dear place in my heart. I grew up with these books. I was a prolific poster on Mugglenet Interactive, where I made lifelong friends to this day, and I went to the midnight book releases. As a closeted queer kid, I found so much comfort in the the story of the kid living in the closet under the stairs who went on a magical adventure with chosen family.

As long as JK Rowling continues her hateful transphobic activism, I cannot and will not support her projects. My love of these books has been forever tarnished seeing the vitriol she holds for trans people. Numerous trans folks found similar comfort in these books as I did, and it is in solidarity with them that I am rating these books 1/5 stars. I refuse to give any more money to JKR’s licenses. I cannot look at these books anymore without feeling sick to my stomach over the surge in violence towards the trans community.

Servent-House-Pixie Dobby ... I cannot help sighing.). I like the book 3, so I'll keep it up. now I'm trying the book 2 before.

WORMING FOR JAPANESE LEARNERS: (all my opinion but many readers think like I do. look the Amazon.jp review if you read Japanese, please.) THE TRANSLATION INTO JAPANESE IS RABBISH! This translation is not translated well. I don't agree with many points of this series' translation. Especially, with Japanese grammer and usages of words. You may learn woring Japanese or be disapointed with this translaton. Japanese is not a populer language so there's not so many translations into English from Japanese novels. You can chose a book there's no translation or which is translated into English . Translaters' works can't be perfect, but good jobs can be present. Mrs. Matsuoka's works are not including of these jobs unfortunately."

I'm rounding my review from 4.5 to 5. Definitely going to check the next out of the library! I loved the characters, especially how Harry wasn't bland or a jerk, and even enjoyed the Dursleys, his cliché ""foster"" family who want nothing to do with magic or anything far from the ordinary. I also happened to like the cover art of my edition, so that's a bonus.

EDIT (3rd time reading through it):
JK Rowling really killed it with the foreshadowing in this series, and I loved all the words she used to describe the characters, from warmhearted Hagrid to poor Neville. I got into it a lot later than all of my friends, but I'm still glad I jumped onto the Hogwarts Express when I still had time to binge all these books (then again, time probably won't stop me now either)..."

Either way, I was right in the target demographic for them (teenage boy into fantasy/sci-fi/genre fiction - what prior to the current mindless pop culture trend would have been called derogatorily a nerd). Very early on I was having to force myself to read mere paragraphs. Certainly if everyone else likes this, the problem must be with me? This was an early indication that everyone else has bad taste, they like things that suck. I got to the hat sorting scene and the dialogue was so atrocious I set the book down and called it quits. Since then, I've continued to DNF things I hate (books, shows, movies, games); there's so much good stuff I want to experience I'm not wasting time on crap. Whenever I told people I hated it, they always assumed it was some religious objection about witchcraft; no, the book just sucked, I would tell them. JK Rowling is a hack."

Only seen the movies as a kid. I am 28 starting on the Harry Potter book series for the first time. Stephen Fry audio narration is an amazing way to get into it. J.K.

I’m a Percy Jackson fan, so I’ve always been bitter towards the Harry Potter fandom, but I set my feelings aside and wanted to try it out, see if it was actually good. I mean, you can’t live in the 21st century and not at least read one Harry Potter book, right?

Wrong.

This book was fine and all, but it doesn’t live up to its hype, not one bit. It’s a pretty simple plot, with uninteresting characters, but the writing style seems enough to keep my going. Then, a little while later, I’m reading Chamber of Secrets and I give up on Chapter 8. It’s just not good enough. If it takes three books for a series to start getting good, it’s not worth reading."

Harry Potter is just so bad. I think Western society is capable of mass delusions and to be fair Eastern societies probably are, too. But witness Trump. Witness Qanon. Witness Brexit. Witness BoJo as British PM. Witness widespread 80's belief in satanic cults. Witness alien abduction ""accounts."" Pathetic and irrational, all of the above.

Other than that the book(s) goes on in the same pedestrian vein of ""Hermione scowled"" (I swear this is the only word Rowling is able to use for physiognomic expression).

Beautiful and magical. Jim Kay is just so talented!"
258,259,1,"Couldn't finish. I read around a hundred pages and hated every minute of it. After watching the movies, the story lost its novelty. Add to that the fact that the book is written for small children (I'm 16), I couldn't get through it. I know that the books mature as the series goes on, but I just don't have the patience to get through the first few when I've already seen the movies. It sucks knowing that I would have liked the series if I'd just read it as a kid. I know I would have loved the humor, but now that I'm older it's just annoying. Oh well. The millennials can keep their favorite series."
259,260,1,"Did people really fall so in love with yet another version of the sad kid finds out he is special and has adventures story??? Wizard isn't even a new twist.

Everyone knows Lev Grossman wrote a better version anyway. Not to mention it wasn't so verbose it sounded as if a child on coffee for the first time wrote it. His was WAY better and was actually WELL written!!! But he got a TV show and I got a castle and endless movies and servants (don't worry, they don't want a sock).

Ooh, maybe I should claim that Hermione was really a TERF! And that she wrote spells to undo TRA spells! Or I could just do my usual and say that some character we never saw was really from Nigeria."

(See Diane Duane's Young Wizards series as an example of a fantasy series about teens that I really, really like.) At least in the beginning, the books seemed pretty formulaic and predictable. I hear that they get darker and more intense as the series goes on, but my interest was lost by book number three."

I’ve finally decided this book will no longer be finished - and it’s being put to rest after ten years.

I found the beginning of this book too slow-paced, and it was very hard for me to stay interested or invested in the book because of it.

I think if I were to reread this book after a few years I might find myself liking it. My teacher forced us to watch 3 of the movies in class, and they weren't that bad."
265,266,1,"The last few chapters were actually quite entertaining and I almost wanted to raise my rating to 3, but then Dumbledore had to ruin it. The competition was closed, you can't just make up shit to give them extra points. That was so rude.

EDIT: knocking the rating down to 1-1.5ish, simply because I feel bad giving other books two stars now, knowing that this is so much worse in comparison"
266,267,1,"this book is so shit i can’t even explain it like bruh- no one cares about harry’s stupid little life where he goes to boarding school, that happens to everyone and don’t even get me started on the ginger freaks and why do the books have to be so long- also i’m pretty sure the author of the book is homophobic. i know harry potter is a trend at private schools right now but be real they r just rich and posh kids who want to be ✨dIfFereNt✨ but i mean draco’s hands are kinda hot but still i want to wipe my grandmas ass with this book 🥰🥰"
267,268,1,"The theme of the book would be “what you do when you have privilege, honor, and power”.
I personally did not like the book. The movie was more entertaining. The book was slow of pace, and kind of boring. Nothing more i can say really :/
Likes:
-clever characters
-smart use of words for making spell names
-the universe was very well planned and thought out
Dislikes
-was not entertaining
-i felt like i had to force myself through the book
-the author has a history of being homophobic and transphobic (that does not have to do with the rating of the book)"
268,269,1,"Rowling is a horrible human, it turns out but I already own the book and thought my son would like it. He's non-verbal. I read one chapter and asked him if he liked it. He typed, ""no."" I was surprised as Rowling's awfulness is not evident in a single single chapter. I asked him why.
""Transphobe,"" he typed.
Never underestimate the intelligence of a person society labels ""low-functioning"" because they don't fit in normative boxes.
He's both correct and an infinitely better human than her."
269,270,1,"You're a wizard, Harry.

By the time I got around to finally reading this book, all the movies had been produced except for Deathly Hallows. I didn't want to read this book, and I still don't. It's been overrated and I just didn't like it. I knew the concept of the book well enough to know that everything is predictable and the series will never leave a serious impact on me.

I made it through book 1 and 2 and I cannot make myself read the rest.

I'm sorry Potter lovers, I cannot do it."
270,271,1,Stars I didnt like this book. It was so boring! Ugh! Everything was boring and dragged out. Harry Potter is the most boring character of all time. I don't know how this book was over 300 pages! It was 300 pages of nothing. Maybe if I had read this when I was a kid I would have liked it. But I'm not a kid. I swear every person my age love these books. If this is a good book they need to read something else.
271,272,1,"I loved reading this as a child and it was an influential series on my life, but I can not recommend anyone to read these books, or ANY from JK Rowling and her various aliases. She is blatantly transphobic and refuses to acknowledge how bigoted, incorrect, and harmful her comments are regarding trans women and the LGBTQ+ community in general. So disappointing.

If trans rights are important to you, don’t read or recommend."
272,273,1,"i feel like everyone’s lying about liking harry potter😳
it was just soooooo boring and i wanted to dnf it for so long but still pushed myself through because everyone’s said it’s so great
i think it’s just people getting nostalgia from happy times because without it the book is trash
the magical world portrayed in the movies was fantastic but the book was just not it. it had too many unnecessary details and the “interesting” ending/fighting scene was just skipped! like the hell?"
273,274,1,"Dearthly unimaginative wallow through frayed kids fantasy themes. Rowling's at her best when blatantly plagiarizing - at least those bits are engaging. I'm appalled at this series' continued popularity, and I with weak noncommittal disinterest hope for some truth in friends' claims to the improvement of the books in later volumes."
274,275,1,"After rereading the Lord of the Rings Trilogy in preparation for the movies, I thought I'd give this book a go to see what the fuss was about.

No fuss. Couldn't read past page 3 because it SUCKS!"
275,276,1,I have read the first three Harry Potter books and seen the first two movies. I dislike them because Harry does the same things as the villians and gets away with it. I don't think that's a very good role model for children. Plus the line of good and evil is very thin. I love fantasy but I don't like witch craft. Seen too many things.
276,277,1,"When I saw one of my brighter high school students reading this, I asked if I could borrow it, and read it overnight. I quickly set aside my curmudgeonly response to Rowling's reworking of old fairy tale material, and allowed myself to be carried along by her innovations on it, like the train for Hogwarts being in a kind of other dimension (or whatever)."
277,278,1,"I put it in the Canon simply because everyone says you have to read the Harry Potter books-even adults. I am not a huge fiction reader (OK that's obvious from my book list). I have to say I just don't get it, what is all the buzz about HP? It's juvenile, but unlike Coupland's ""microserfs"", it is supposed to be so I won't put it on the TURD HEAP. But frankly not far away."
278,279,1,"What complete and utter trash. Why this made a decent movie is only a testament to film makers. From a complete breakdown in the ability to write and spell the english language propperly, to weak plot, and an overextended use of deus ex machina. I this this book should be counted as an infectious disease. It causes idiocy in most smart people who have read it."
279,280,1,"i was planning on rereading these now as an adult but, to be completely honest, i just don't feel like it lmao there's enough evidence out there to show that there's not enough death to the author in the world to erase all of the transmisogyny, racism and antisemitism written in these books like... wake up jkr's tweets did not come from nowhere she was hiding her opinions in plain sight"
280,281,1,"SO GODDAMN OVERRATED! If I wanted to read about magic and epic fights, I would just read Fairy Tail. I read part of this book and it was pretty stupid and horrible how Harry's foster parents treated him. I don't see any of the hype about this series and award J.K. Rowling no pints and may God have mercy on her soul for writing this rubbish."
281,282,1,"I read this to my partner, hence it taking us seven months to finish as he’s not much of a reader. It was the first reread for us and we both read it the first time in our teens. I honestly forgot how hilarious Peeves was a s reading him aloud as a character was the best fun! Can’t believe it took me more than half my life to reread this amazing book."
282,283,1,"I honestly don't get why anyone likes this book or the series in general. It's got nothing going for it and no good points. I enjoyed twilight more than this.

If I could give negative stars I would. Easily on the top of my ""most hated books"" list and easily one of the worst books I've had the misfortune of reading. If you want to read a good book, avoid this entire series like it's the plague."
283,284,1,"I want to give these books a break because they are written for children, but honestly that is an insult to children. The plot is extremely simple and predictable, the characters are so one-dimensional it is comical, and there seems to be absolutely nothing beneath the shallow surface of the plot. No thought, no commentary, no point."
284,285,1,
285,286,1,A lot of people love Harry Potter but I didn't like it. I found that it didn't have enough going on to keep you occupied. I thought the idea was good I just didn't think it exicuted. It felt like the book went on and on. It did get better at the end but not good enough for me to want to readthe other books.
286,287,1,I have wacthed the movies quite a few times and really like them. So I had high expectations going in. However this was just a really dull book and really didn't get me engaged in it. I gotta say I didn't enjoy it at all I even stopped reading the book because it just wasn't good. A very overrated book.
287,288,1,"an unpopular opinion but i found the book quite boring 😅 well partially it is my fault because i am not into sorcerers and wands, the other reason i hated the book is because of the characters they annoyed me the only two i loved was Dumbledore and Hagrid. Oh and i hate the 'true one' concept or the hero that gonna save all 😑"
288,289,1,"Not worth reading fell asleep after first chapter and the movies to Harry potter absolutely terrible wasted money buying the movies returned them to hmv for refund also asked Amazon for refund of the full cost off all jk Rowling books a terrible author who obviously doesn't have a clue what on earth she talking about.

Definitely wouldn't refer it to my faeces let alone another human being"
289,290,1,"This really isn’t a book everyone should read once, so I have no clue who put it on such a list. Rowling’s bigotry makes itself clear in everything she writes. Even if you hate trans people, her racism, antisemitism, fondness of body shaming and hatred of anyone who does not look like her is abundantly present."
290,291,1,"I got this as a gift and although I like children's stories and fantasy stories, Harry Potter isn't my case. It has been heavily promoted and also through the film, but I found the book very boring and ""artificial"", neither for kids nor adults. Maybe it's just me, I know some (adults) that are absolutely crazy about it."
291,292,1,
292,293,1,"I used to love this series. Always brought a warm fuzzy feeling to me like a security blanket… the author’s anti-trans statements though have soured a once great work. She’s been so outspoken that it really does make it hard to enjoy it anymore… hopefully one day maybe, but for now it just makes me sad knowing how much she wouldn’t like me."
293,294,1,Reread for the magic! Even though the author has become a bit of a horror. *I was going to reread the entire series (I’m not sure I ever made it past book three before). I feel pretty guilty now for JK is super transphobic…I am going to focus on not reading books by authors who are shit people (in my opinion and if I can help it). I definitely could’ve helped it. Now let’s do better!*
294,295,1,"I started reading this in ninth grade and never made it past chapter two. It's written for children, so the writing wasn't compelling enough for me. I almost picked up a harry potter this year, but I was just curious as to what happens next in the movies. tough cookies, ladies and gentlemen."
295,296,1,"This was to long!but i finished reading it.
I didn't really understand what it's mainly about.
magic i guess?.i wouldn't really read it again
because it took me like a hole month or two to finsh it."
296,297,1,"Boring, obvious, borderline painful literature. The only bright side is that this book is the only one suitable for children in the whole series. I'll have to pass on scaring the crap out of children. k thanks."
297,298,1,"I really dislike this book. Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone was just one acceptance to the ""book is always better than the movie"" saying. The movie was better than the book. I just didn't like this book...Maybe that's why I am not a Harry Potter Fan and I'm a Twilight fan :)"
298,299,1,Everyone loves the harry potter series. I do not see why. The books where slow and dragged on. The whole world of magic was intriguing but the only reason I could even finish the book was I was bet to read the whole series. It felt unnecessarily long and incredibly boring.
299,300,1,I don't understand why everyone loves this series...it sucks. Not gonna lie. This is my very unpopular opinion however. If you like books that seem to drone on and on and go absolutely nowhere go for it.
300,301,1,"I liked this series starting at book 3, but I found the first one to just be too kiddish for me, and uninteresting, luckily it was very short and everyone told me they get better so I continued with the next one which was a bit better."
301,302,1,"Intensely overrated book. The writing is mediocre at best, the character's names are embarrassing. The concept had potential but the book was just awful. Comparing it to the Chronicles of Narnia and other classics is a disgrace to great literature."
302,303,1,"The book is fine overall but is fatphobic, misogynistic, etc. it has a lot of the author's problematic views written into it. Also, Joanne Kathleen Rowling is Transphobic and transphobes don't get stars."
303,304,1,I don't understand how the planet has gone head over heels with these books. I have been warned that the first is the worst. I will plow through to the second but I do confess that the first was a trying experience to read. Really trying. Very dull. Very dull. Exrtremely dull. Did I say dull?
304,305,1,"I get why this might be fun if you're a child and like escapism, but as an adult this is just too childish. I'm not even going to address the many plot holes, the poor world-design and the fact that magic does not seem to work at all."
305,306,1,It's fine for what it is: a generic children's fantasy story that follows formulas to the letter. There is nothing outstanding or remarkable about the book other than its popularity. There are better books that challenge the reader and engage the mind.
306,307,1,"In my opinion i will never read the rest of the books, or see the movies. to me it is stupid and a waste of time, i mean really nerds with wands? this was dumb. was is everyone so obsessed with it????"
307,308,1,"It's pointless to criticize HP in this day and age. I'm only going to say that I don't think it's bad, it's just that I didn't like it, and I don't think I would've liked it as a kid as many people always use as excuse.

Still, people can't say I didn't gave it a chance"
308,309,1,"on its own its shit but methods of rationality used this as a foundation for an actual story of quality, so i suppose this one has some merit hidden somewhere deep within the too-many pages and over-descriptive words"
309,310,1,"to anyone reading this..............I dont like Harry Potter. Something about wizards and magic bores me. I don't know why, but I just don't like it. I tried reading it and got through half, and then just said, why am i reading this. Sorry if this offended someone, but this is just my opinion."
310,311,1,"Where to start.... Dont! These books are terrible, I understand that they have a huge following but that’s probably down to the media pushing them like they the next bible (im not religious) but people please do not read these to your children"
311,312,1,"I tried to read this book and I quickly found out that it was not for me. I just can not stop thinking about the things I know about J.K. Rowling. If you like the book, good for you, but I personally can not stand it."
312,313,1,"2017 review:
This book has way too many plot holes and I just did not enjoy reading. I only read the first book, and I just didn't like it. Sorry fans of Harry Potter but I'm entitled to my opinion.

edit (2021): rereading this review makes me die of laughter"
313,314,1,"This was read to me when I was in the third grade and I hated it. I don't understand the hype. There's nothing magical about it, even though the book is literally about magic. I don't have much of an imagination though, so maybe this book is for those who do."
314,315,1,"I wasn't completely under the spell of any of the books from the series. The book didn't grab me personally. I know most people love the series, but I couldn't read one page without going over it the second time."
315,316,1,I just in generally don’t like Harry potters books cause I think they are really boring a super long and I feel like they just don’t get anywhere they stay on the same topic but that’s just in my opinion thank you
316,317,1,JK rowling is outdated racist homophobic transphobic trash. There are so many amazing YA books out now-a-days. Lets yeet this trash out of the public hemisphere. JK Rowling doesn't deserve half the recognition and fame she gets.
317,318,1,"Don't hate me! I'm going to vent a little so....

Anyways I HATED this book. I thought that this book would be as good as people said it was, but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooo! I found it too dumb to move on and I hated it! The characters were stupid to me! I mean, I had my hopes UP!!!!"
318,319,1,"I’ve been reading this for like 3 years at this point and I can’t get through it. It’s boring and really not that great. So this ins finally the dnf.

And let’s be honest JKR is a huge TERF, so f*ck her"
319,320,1,"This was one of the most formative books of my childhood. However, the author is a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and is not worth supporting. If you're looking for kid-friendly fantasy, try the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan."
320,321,1,Maybe this rating is unfair. I did not finish the book. The first 100 pages was enough of a slog I opted not to make it through the rest. It needs a better hook to pull readers in (though I get I'm also in the minority for this opinion given its track record). There are better books out there.
321,322,1,"After she-who-shall-not-be-named came out as a TERF, I gave up even trying to pretend I understood these books. Not for me.

I'm not even sure why I'm reviewing this, considering everyone already knows what it is and they've made their own decision."
322,323,1,don't get me started
323,324,1,Updated rating in 2020: JK Rowling is a bigot.
324,325,1,I'm lying. I've never read it and I never will. And it's all because I'm a stubborn asshole.
325,326,1,Boring and convinced me not to read any more books in the franchise.
326,327,1,tape dee..
327,328,1,For some reason I am just not a fan of Harry Potter. I guess I am an oddball
328,329,1,read it with my mommy and didn't like it
329,330,1,i don't know who wants to read these books
330,331,1,Sorry I do not see the magic. It seems like a children's fantasy book. Not for me.
331,332,1,"I'd really like this book if I were 10. That's obnoxious, sorry."
332,333,1,"not my cup of tea. then again, i don't like shit in my tea."
333,334,1,It's too bad that J.K. Rowling is a TERFy asshole. I'll never willingly give her a penny again.
334,335,1,I had to read this for my Childrens' lit class and I didn't like it. :( I am not a goblin type of fan I guess.
335,336,1,i hate harry potter its so bloody boring!!!!
336,337,1,-puts two thumbs down- (this book kinda sucks) I AM BORED HA HA HA
337,338,1,"Overrated, badly written with a poor plot. Interesting enough for young children, but there are plenty of better written and more interesting books for anyone over 12."
338,339,1,"BAD BOOK!!!
I DON""T LIKE IT AT ALL!!!!
BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
339,340,1,predictable plot. boring. novels like these are a dime a dozen when you're a kid. This one was just well marketed and synergized. fuck harry potter.
340,341,1,I hate Harry Potter crap.
341,342,1,Not the original title: the original UK title is 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'. Why did the title even have to be dumbed down?
342,343,1,I hate the harry potter series they are so boring and weird
343,344,1,I didnt like how unreal it was and how boring it was. The only thing that kept me reading was doing an english accient in my head.
344,345,1,"maybe it is just me, but i found this book very boring...

i gave up after page 150.
sorry J.K. Rowling fans."
345,346,1,So formulaic. Am I the only one in the universe not turned on by Harry Potter? Yeah. Oh well.
346,347,1,good reads sucks it doesnt let you do one fourt of a star
347,348,1,Not a big fan of fantasy to begin with. Got to chapter 3 and fell asleep because it was really boring!
348,349,1,i think harry poter is veeerrry boring srry
349,350,1,"This book was boring to me I'm not sure why, but I couldn't read it! I did finish it, but It's boring"
350,351,1,htis is one of the most boringiast books ever i would not read it its just comp;etley borin
351,352,1,barely better then twilight
352,353,1,"Very boring, I had trouble getting through it. I kept waiting for something to happen, very formulaic and predictable. This is a great book for people who do not read much."
353,354,1,the begining was boring but after that it became interesting.
354,355,1,"Shallow, clichéd and boring. A very low-rent mash-up of Enid Blyton's 'Naughtiest Schoolgirl' and 'Oliver Twist', but without the heart."
355,356,1,I read the first chapter. This shit is AWFUL.
356,357,1,For some reason i could not get into this book. One hundred pages in and I was like this book sucks. I'm not going to bad mouth it but I just don't like it
357,358,1,"I tried VERY hard to like this book and just couldn't. The audiobook put me to sleep. And the movie dragged on and on. Add ""Dislikes Harry Potter"" to my growing list of why I'm a freak!"
358,359,1,داستان بچگی هامان! همان موقع که می خواندم جذبش شده بودم بد جور! از خوابم می زدم که این کتاب را بخوانم! اما خب، بعد که تمام شد دیگر نمی خواستم ریختش را ببینم! :|
359,360,1,I don't support white trash anymore.
360,361,1,"Tried to buy this for my Kindle, but couldn't get through all the pain in the ass process that the site redirects you to."
361,362,1,She’s transphobic. The books are ok themselves but Percy Jackson is better.
362,363,1,JKR is a bigot and it shows in the text.
363,364,1,"This was, in my opinion, a very dull and predictable book, it get's much hype that it does not live up to."
364,365,1,J.K. Rowling is a TERF and these books are super fatphobic.
365,366,1,A classic in my opinion. Always a joy to read.
366,367,1,I liked it when I read it but I'm giving it one star 'cause I do not intend to support a transphobic person at all :)
367,368,1,"on this account we do not stan jk rowling

also 11 year old me was right when i said this was dull

1st read : 3 stars"
368,369,1,It's has alot of antisemitic rhetoric in it. Made me really uncomfortable
369,370,1,Book was good until you realize how many problematic ideas the series and the author have. This is tough as I grew up with the book but I am just not going to support her or her work anymore.
370,371,1,It was a boring book and I didn't understand the plot line its so overrated
371,372,1,Changing my review in light of all the information I've been made aware of about the author. We don't support transphobia.
372,373,1,"Non ho idea del perché ma a 12 anni,quando mi piacevano i libri della Troisi,lessi il primo Harry Potter e mi fece schifo.Misteri dell'infanzia..."
373,374,1,Sagði ekki einhver að þessar bækur væru ruslfæði bókmennta?
374,375,1,el mejor libro del mundo
375,376,1,Bland dull and a total bore-fest.
376,377,1,0 stars Harry Potter the WORST series I have ever read
377,378,1,Utter trash
378,379,1,This is my first time reading the illustrated edition and the illustrations are so perfect! I can’t wait to have illustrated editions of the full series!
379,380,1,4 to 1 star because this author is transphobic and harmful to marginalized communities.
380,381,1,"Never did much like books about children. Even when I was a kid, I wanted to know what to aspire to, not what stupid kids were doing."
381,382,1,I found Harry Potter to be very boring. Not many people agree but I don't really care.
382,383,1,beurk
383,384,1,"Honestly, I think this book is very boring. It is not the worst book but definitely not good."
384,385,1,In this house we don’t support TERFS. Also as adult reflecting on the HP series it is not good.
385,386,1,Not a fan of fantasy
386,387,1,trash
387,388,1,Enjoyed for the nostalgia but I don't give terfs good star ratings
388,389,1,Garbage.
389,390,1,I honestly (Not to be mean) hated Harry Potter so much it was the slowest book I have ever read! I avoid reading it at all costs! I mean why do people even like Harry Potter?!?!?!?!?! >:(!!!!!!!
390,391,1,this was ass you guys [ review soon ]
391,392,1,"I read this book in 3rd grade, and I hated it. I wasn't interested in all. I think this book is overrated because it wasn't very interesting and I wish I knew more about the characters."
392,393,1,"It was predictable. Harry don’t go there, Harry goes there. That was how it was through the hole book. The book got sooo much praise but it was truly terrible. Do not recommend this book AT ALL!"
393,394,1,"I have to say that this book is overhyped and kind of trash, let's be honest. I could barely begin the book, and reading it was tedious. 1/5 Stars - Not worth your time and attention."
394,395,1,I rate this book one star because of you know Jonny Orlando he is my brother
395,396,1,Dumb magic
396,397,1,"ya...just wasn't good.not my cup of tea, SISTER"
397,398,1,DODO
398,399,1,Meh...
399,400,1,I can't read any book help
400,401,1,"The magic these books held for me as a child is gone. If only JKR had been an ally, then maybe we could have learned from the problematic parts of this series.
I'm done making excuses."
401,402,1,This book sucks I hate Harry Potter and and this book just sucks
402,403,1,"This book fast, I demand pages, pictures are orange, Me like annoying orange ""hey apple""
me no understand why its called the soccer stone. My BIG problem is this book fake no fake in my hood"
403,404,1,I'll be going to my grave assuming that it was the movies that did the heavy lifting.
404,405,1,
405,406,1,This book isnt realistic btw he has an uncle called sirius who dies. voldemort is inside of him and proffesor quirell has voldemort on the back of his head.
406,407,1,J.K. Rowling sucks.
407,408,1,Please for the love of god just read “The Name of the Wind” or “A Wizard of Earthsea” instead and stop supporting this violent transphobe and her lame ass stories.
408,409,1,Read it in 9th/10th standard (2003) - felt it was dumb then and it is dumber now.
409,410,1,high school
410,411,1,JK Rowling is a trans-exclusive radical feminist and extremely transphobic. I'm done supporting any material by an author who consistently feels the need to invalidate my existence.
411,412,1,I THINK THE MIND OF A CHILD IN HARRY POTTERS BOOKS WAS OVER DRIVE IT WAS WORST THEN MAKING A SCHOOL ASSIGMENT.
412,413,1,JK Rowling is a terf and this entire series is colonial copaganda.
413,414,1,i love trans women so much❤️
414,415,1,terf writer
415,416,1,Author is a shithead
416,417,1,I just could not get into it at all. So a DNF for me.

473,474,1,"All of the hullaballoo about the magic of Harry Potter is just that. There's nothing about it that makes me uncomfortable. The wizards and witches aren't drawing power from the devil to power their magic. They are born with the ability to do magic. Simple as that. They go to Hogwarts to learn how to do it better, like having a natural talent with the piano and taking lessons to use that and improve. And there is a part of magic that is dark magic that the good characters are not supposed to do, and they only keep stuff about it at Hogwarts so they can know how to defend against it. The spells that are supposedly ""real spells used by real witches"" are just Latin or Greek words, sometimes altered a bit or paired to sound better. The only actual ""spell"" is Avada Kedavra, which is the original form of, you guessed it, abracadabra. Apparently the original purpose was to cure illness and J.K. Rowling twisted the meaning a little to suit her book purposes. It might be lazy writing, but it's certainly not actual witchcraft. If the magic was the sole mark against the book, I would have no qualms handing this book to a small child.
The magic, unfortunately, has nothing to do with why I didn’t like it.
The first chapter is completely pointless. It doesn't need to be there. All the information in it is shared again later in the book. It doesn't even really have the main character in it. It serves no point and could have been cut completely. The way Dumbledore handled the whole thing with Harry's custody was completely horrible. If he was just going to leave Harry to be raised by Muggles anyway, why did he send Hagrid to get Harry before the officials could arrive at the scene only to dump Harry on the Dursley's doorstep and go away? If Dumbledore was going to knock on the door and explain to the Dursleys everything that happened, maybe consider actually telling them about the death of their family in person, delivering Harry like that might have made sense. But no, he just wrote a letter and left a baby on a literal, expecting everything to be all right. If he had just left Harry to the Muggle foster care system, Harry might have ended up with relatives or a foster family that actually wanted him. At the very least, the Dursleys would have had to choose to take Harry in, which might have made them a little less resentful towards him.
Once we finally get to truly meet the main character, we are clobbered over the head with how abused Harry is and how we need to feel sorry for him. Well, I don't. No, the Dursleys aren't all that nice to Harry, but they aren't really that abusive, either. So he sleeps in a closet. Big deal. He's fed and clothed, and the worst abuse he gets is from bullies at school, which happens to too many kids to make him an object of pity. Percy Jackson was abused much more by his stepfather than Harry ever is by his family. Compared to him, Harry's doing pretty great
   And you know what? I'm just going to say it. Harry Potter doesn't have much of a personality."
474,475,1,"Estimados, lectores. Personalmente os quiero invitar cordialmente a la ""second reseña"" Parte 2, version ""el stand de los besos 2"", o tambien conocida por el genterio como ""The kissing booth 2"", en el caso de que su persona sea internacionale como ye, sabra a que me refiero...😏.
Primeramente, a mi persona le gustaria arguyir el prefacio Parte 2 comenzando a principalmente, hablar sobre lo primero que os quiero contar, primeramente. Empecemos por lo que todos queremos escuchar. De donde rayos exceputar la guitarra de marco polo de la playa con Elle (una muchacha internacionale, por lo que veo)? Me explico, camaradas. Lo que quiero decir, es que.
Es que MVP ha materializado la guitarra a su lado, ya que el no la llevaba con sigo, y como hemos todos aprendido, la materia no se crea ni se destruye (Zeile 9ff bei ""Einstein""). Significa eso que Marco VP es un superhèroe? Significa esto que ha ganado ese tonto torneo que a propòsito es surrealista e irrealista e ano(😏)rmal e a-natural y rompe con lo terreno, lo natural y lo social. Luego de descomponer la escena del totno torneo, que debo decir me ha hecho derramar una lagrimilla... de lo tan bobo (Que mira bobo, anda palla🏉🏉🏉) que era muy surrealista, muy del genero absurdo, ya que un torneo tan grande me parece torpe, muy poco probable de que pase (Como Viplet Sorrentino desgarrò, desbaratò y arrancò las entrañas de su propia alcoba luego de haber tenido una noche intensa y humeda con Mr. Riorson), podemos expirar que se trata de una trama del genero fantastico, que limita, por cierto, con el genero de lo extraño, segun Nadarov (😛⛳).
Me atreveria a incluso concluir con mi primer argumento de este arguyen, concluyendo diciendo que el señor Marco Valentin P. , se ha sacado la misma guitarra del lugar donde el sol no da.
Segundamente, y ya no tan principalmente, ya que lo principal ha sido dicho, y si no lo ha leido le recomiendo que lo lea para entender el sentido de todo el prefacio y de la vida misma (Parte 2), me gustaria acosar el siguiente tema de mi lista de cositas que no me han agradado o parecido placenteras. *tose tose* (o *cof cof* si eres internacionale como yeah) Me parece de suma importancia fdstacar que me parece ridiculo, e inclusamente, insultante el anverso dado por la torpe protagonista principale 🤌🏿(simon). Me explico muchaches? Vale, me explicarè explicandome. Las jetas que hace la señorita Elle a lo largo del filme 🧐 son por no decir, las caras que haria bella, una muchacha que no hace falta presentar ya que todos conocemos la gran desgracia que ha sido esta fantastica pero horrible pero genial pero triste pero divertida pero tonta, pero inteligentemente, pero estupida (perdon por mi lenguaje, es que estos temas hacen me dan rabia y la cara se me pone de un color carmesi). es decir, ciertas caras me dan la piel cierta y conocida por ser de un pequeño fanfarron galliforme ceo. Ciertas caras me parecen, a mi parecer, muy poco normales, muy poco acordes a una persona normale. Aqui (Z. 788888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888 ff 1234) se ve clarinetemente, el tema de lo maravilloso (Todorov, si, no tengo ganas de hacer mas bromas, no no, eso es para jovenzuelos), donde suceso cosas extrañas, sin explicacion, a menos que Elle sea acustica, o una niña bautista. esto es clasico del genero fantastico.
Terceramente, por primera vez, explayarè primeramente mi opiniòn personal sobre la parte que màs hizo que me mojara los pantalones (upsi): Su aplicaciòn a la llamada universidad o ""College"" (Nivel de ingles ¡Aprobado!👍🏽profesora, gracias maestra Miel, me vinieron analèpsis in media res). Me explico, nuevamente, lo que mi corazon quiere deciros, es que la señora Elle, se espera que grandes unis, la acepten, como lo es la gran universidad de Harvardo, la de Berklello, y etc tce etcctectdfeerta (perdon, me ha agarrado un ataque de nervios con tan solo acordarme de dicha escena). Ella, tan ilusa, tan.... adoquina, se cree, desnudamente, que con ese eassey va a entrar a estas universidades. Parte dos mas adelan"
475,476,1,"Changing my ratings for the Harry Potter books from 5 to 1 and here's why:

Recently I've learnt about some problematic writers and then I changed my ratings for the books. I did not do these for the Harry Potter mainly because of nostalgic reasons. But let's change that.

I am heart broken becasue this series has a truly sentimental story for me, and now I feel like she who shall not be named has tainted it in a big way.

I never read the books in their heyday, and I did not watch the movies until 2016 right after reading the first book. My grandmother had read the series back in 2004, and loved it. When she passed away, her copies ended up in storage...I begged to have them as my Christmas gift for many years and was told they were deep in storage. I randomly came upon them after moving one box...Needless to say I have my grandmother's copies now. They don't all have dust jackets, and are different sizes...Which normally would drive my OCD crazy....but doesn't even come across my mind. My grandmother is the reason I read, and more importanlty the reason I accept and love all people.

I sat down to read the first book, and to be honest...since I already knew so much about the world of HP and happend to be spolied about a HUGE plot point by a well known BookTuber/Toker...I wasn't as motivated to read the series...BUT.....then I got to this part....

SLIGHTLY SPOILERY

As I am holding my grandmother's copy knowing she was probably right there reading over my shoulder...Dumbledoor began to tell Harry recoiled when Quirrell touched him...

""Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's leaves it's own mark. Not a scar, no visable sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this very reason. It was agonay to touch a person marked by something so good.""

I think I ugly cried for about an hour thinking about my grandma, how she loved people and especially me, how much trauma I have been through and that her love guides and protects me."
476,477,1,"Il fallait bien que cela arrive, oui, un intellectuel comme moi, lire Harry Potter, avec tous les préjugés que je transporte sur cette franchise depuis ma plus tendre enfance. Rien qu’à voir la gueule des fans (pas tous, certains sont très beaux) je savais que ça n’allait pas me plaire. Mais comme j’aime me faire des ennemis, surtout en soirée, j’ai voulu lire HP afin de pouvoir mettre le nez des fans dans leur caca.
J’avoue avoir été enthousiaste à la lecture du premier chapitre.
Puis vient le deuxième.
Nous comprenons alors que le livre est manichéen : soit les personnages sont du côté d’Harry, soit ils sont contre lui. Bien sûr, aucune subtilité. Prenons Dudley comme exemple. Il a trois caractéristiques : être gros (Rowling le compare à un cochon, un singe, se demande pourquoi il veut un vélo, puisqu’il est gros !), capricieux et méchant avec Harry.
J’arrête ma lecture vers la centième page. « Mais ça devient mieux à partir de là, justement » viendront me dire les fans hystériques/ attardés/ nostalgiques (barrez les mentions inutiles). Peut-être, répondrais-je, mais ai-je envie de lire un livre dont je n’ai rien à dire sur le personnage principal, charismatique comme un ongle incarné ? Parce que le personnage d’HP est fade, générique, tant que je ne saurais pas résumer son caractère.

Il reste cependant une question que je n’arrive pas à résoudre. Celle du style. Car le style de Rowling correspond trait pour trait au style des fanfictions que nous pouvons lire sur internet. Me vient donc la question de l’œuf ou la poule. Ces fanfictions sont-elles écrites ainsi car les auteurs ont lu Rowling et se sont inspiré de son style ? ou le style de Rowling correspond-il au style d’un mauvais écrivain immature, comme celui des auteurs de fanfictions ? Car c’est finalement ce qu’est Rowling, un auteur de fanfiction (fan Ursula le Guin) ayant vendu des millions de livre."
477,478,1,"Nota 1/5: Libro recomendado para niños de 6 a 10 años.

El libro está bien, si tienes 6 años, magia, hechizos, escapar de la rutina diaria para meterte en otra pero en vez de burocracia, burocracia mágica, trenes mágicos, castillos, dragones, una raza condenada a la esclavitud eterna, ya sabéis cosas de niños.

Aunque recomiende el libro para niños de 6 años, recordarle a vuestro hijo que es un libro y que está bien que le guste la historia, pero porfavor recordarle que es fantasía o dentro de unos años lo tendréis con 40 tacos, mirando pájaros por la ventana, diciendo que esa es carta para Howgarts, mientras su habitación huele a desguace y un muro de funkopops de Harry Potter se alza como guardián de la habitación.

Este libro mola, te hace ver cómo el Reino Unido es basura (la parte ""real"" la de las personas corrientes) y de cómo todo el mundo quiere huir hasta tal punto que se inventan mundos paralelos llenos de magia como es el caso de J.K ""Mujer es cuando parto normal"" Rowling, el libro sigue los cánones clásicos de fantasía de Tolkien, dragones malvados, castillos medievales, gigantes tontos apartados de la sociedad, etc...

El libro nos presenta una serie de cuatro casas:

-Griffindor: Donde van los buenos y casualmente los protagonistas, todo les sale bien a pesar de tener la cabeza de serrín.

-Slytherin: Aquí van los quieren cometer un genocidio.

-Ravenclaw: Aquí van los listos.

-Hufflepuff: Aquí van a los que les hacen bullying.

El villano de esta saga de libros es Adolf Hitler, solo que no tiene nariz y se llama Lord Voldemort, están poderoso que solo aparece en el capítulo final y hace absolutamente nada."
478,479,1,"I have no nostalgia for these books, I didn't read them as a kid. I listened to the audiobook versions as an adult, thinking that despite J.K. Rowling's politics, there must be some value to this series.. not so. Some plot beats have the potential to be interesting but are simply lacking in the imaginativity needed to pull them off. And don't even get me started on the bigotry. The goblins (self explanatory), house elves being ""willing slaves"", Rita Skeeter being portrayed as a man-ish, hairy, ugly woman who preys on children's vulnerability is such a blatant show of her transmisogyny.



Ultimately, this screenshot of a post from 4chan of all places sums up my thoughts. It's a surprisingly intelligent critique from one of the worst places on the internet.



In short, I am begging some of you people to read other books. I know many grew up with them, but you're more grown up now and it's time to acknowledge things you liked as a kid can be bad. If these books ""helped you through a tough time"", no they didn't. You helped through a tough time. You would've made it through without J.K. Rowling's dull novels."
479,480,1,"All right, let's think about this......
You send your kids out of the sphere of parental influence to a school where they are taught as important knowledge:
1. Breaking and entering (alohomora)
2. Identity theft (polyjuice)
3. How to poison people (potions)
4. How to cure people from poison (also potions)
5. How to impair people's thinking (confundus)
6. How to wipe people's memory (obliviate)
7. To prevent people from moving, but not by tying them up with ropes (stupefy and petrificus totalus)
8. How to cause explosions (confingo)
9. How to violate the privacy of someone's mind by knowing their thoughts (Legillimency)
10. How to disfigure people (engorgio and densaugeo)
And then These below are taught but as the bad ones
11. Torture (Crucio)
12. Total control (Imperius)
13. Killing (Avada Kedavra)

Okay, so I had fun reading these books and so did my niece and then she got a letter for back to school that was sent like an invitation to go to Hogwarts. She freaked out and started bawling because she didn't want to go. Smart girl.

Here's the deal, in a time where consent is paramount
In a time where we all crave peace.
Why are the most popular children's books out there based around a premise that when brought to light sounds more like a terrorist and assassin training camp than a school?
Why are those skill sets played off in a nonchalant and fun way that is so appealing?
Why is the woman who portrays these very anti-social behaviors as interesting, fun, and valuable skills one of the richest prople in the world?"
480,481,1,"I mean yeah, she's a transphobe.

But also, long before that bit of info came out, I was already unsure who I hated more - the grown up Harry Potter fans, Twilight Fans, or 50 Shades fans who wouldn't shut up about how I had to read their book(s) immediately because they were the best thing ever written and there was absolutely no way I wouldn't totally love it because I love to read and loving to read is literally all that is required to join the obsessive fan clubs.

Now to be fair, I already knew I'd hate both Twilight and 50 Shades because I just don't enjoy those books in general, and they're particularly bad examples of their type, so I just outright refused to try. I don't care if you like them, I won't pretend there's crap I read and love, but I just want to be allowed to > read things if I so choose, you know?

But Harry Potter was a different story. I enjoy children's stories, and magic, and adventure, and so this ought to have been a sure thing. Instead... I just read, and read, and read, and read, and got to the end and still had no idea why people were so obsessed with it. I even read the next couple books trying to give it even of a chance because people I truly liked and respected kept insisting I just had to give it a more time, a more pages...

But no, this is a very boring story about some very boring kids."
481,482,1,"Yeah no, this is a review about my thoughts about the series as a whole.

Jk is a massive transphobe and i dont care what you say, her bigotry leaks into her writing like a disease. Kingsley Shacklebolt? Cho Chang? are you kidding me? How explicitly racist can you be.

And for those of you at an age akin to my grandma, no. Cho Chang is not in fact an actual Chinese name, it is just a racist mockery of how the Chinese language is pronounced.

Hatefulness aside, the whole series is so so poorly written. Harry himself is the most dull, uninteresting and flat character I've ever read about and if you need an example of an actually well written one, just read Percy Jackson by Rick Roirdan for gods sake. And Jk continuously writes random events and deaths for shock value with no real reasoning behind it.

And that just showcases how she is poor as a writer.

And don't even get me started on ""Robert Galbraith"". And before all the terfs come screaming at me, have you actually read The Running Grave?? Its a disgusting and misogynistic piece of text, written by a supposed feminist!!??

Jk rowling is a joke. The harry potter series is a joke.

Terfs can go away <3"
482,483,1,"I was thinking of finally reading this series before my thirtieth birthday, but went in hesitantly. I was having a hard time removing the author from the book- then everything dropped about her new book. I went down a rabbit hole researching which parts of ableism, homophobia and racism inadvertently made its way from the author into HP and there's a lot.

Another side, is that I haven't read Percy Jackson yet either. I really like how the author has stood up to include diversity, after the years that the books were written in weren't where things are today.

So, that leaves me with reading a series with red flags going off in my head the entire time or reading a series without that. I'm choosing the latter. I've seen the HP movies, so I do know some of how neat the magic is though. I guess the main reason why I wanted to finally read the series is that so many people say that it feels like coming home. When it comes down to it, reading a book with those values as a disabled person wouldn't feel like that for me."
483,484,1,"Honestly this was just a boring and poorly done book that essentially rips off older stories and builds itself on tropes. Characters are flat, most of the plot is deus ex machina after deus ex machina, main character is about 90% of the way to being a Gary Stu. Of course it has to be the special boy who's biggest obstacle (besides the unnamed evil) is a few bullies. Also, the Dursley's are terrible people, but they weren't all that wrong in trying to point out that Hogwarts is a bad place. Harry is 11 and is put on the hunt of a unicorn killer, despite how dangerous everyone involved knows this is, and is almost killed by a professor despite the headmaster being quite aware of this possibility. Several almost deaths of the special boy pretty much solely caused by the rampant negligence and disregard of the school faculty, who are ostensibly good people. Story time 101 and I can only guess that it's popularity was due to the marketing of it to 11 year olds who could identify with Harry. One of the lamest fantasy books I've ever read."
484,485,1,"Never got the hype with Harry Potter. Now, I’ve written this kinda review before with other books, but that just shows this is just another piece of popular literature that is WAY too overhyped.

This whole series is LITTERED with racism, ableism, harmful stereotypes, anti semitism, and loads of other things that aren’t even well hidden enough for people to NOT see them.

When I was younger, I did like Harry Potter. I was a Harry Potter fan. But I GREW UP. I realized how absolutely crappy this whole series is, how ridiculous it all is.

People make jokes being like “let’s just pretend J.K Rowling didn’t write it bc she’s transphobic n all that” and yes, she is, she’s a terrible person, but also just throw Harry Potter away in general??? The whole series is terrible just like her??

The books at least are a little tolerable to read, but you just can’t get past all the bigotry written within every letter. It’s disgusting!"
485,486,1,"Transphobic, anti-Semitic piece of trash. Even if I believed that you could separate the art from the artist, which I don’t, this series is still shit. It’s not just JKR that is the problem. The goblins in this series are clearly supposed to be a representation of Jewish people, which is just blatantly anti- Semitic. And there’s also transphobia within the book, especially in the descriptions of Rita Skeeter, who is implied to be trans (descriptions of her include ‘mannish hands’ and ‘surprisingly strong grip’ and more) and is also, surprise surprise, a villain. JKR is a TERF and this series is the work of a TERF that is coloured from start to finish with her transphobic views. Please move on from this series. Trans people are worth more than your nostalgia. Go and find better magical realism that isn’t transphobic and anti-Semitic.

Sincerely,
A nonbinary person who initially loved Harry Potter but realised its problems as they grew older and was able to let go."
486,487,1,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s stone is an adaptation of the first book in the Harry Potter series written by JK Rowling. It is about an 11 year old orphan boy that discovers his parents were wizards and he is too. He then begins a new life as a student at Hogwarts and meets many new friends while also learning more about his parents.

Harry Potter was a book that I always tried to stay away from as a kid. My family and I were never really into the whole wizard thing, but I finally decided to at least read it and give it a chance. Sadly, I just did not care for it at all. It felt like it was written for younger children, which granted, it is. I still do not understand what the hype is about. It was really hard to get through and I do not think I will ever read it again or watch any of the movies.

I would recommend this to middle grade readers up to high school. Anyone above that could still read it and find enjoyment but I would not recommend it."

Obviously, I believed him and I followed him into his white van. After borrowing all the valuable objects in my house for some reason, he joined me in the van and we drove off to Hogwarts.

He locked me in the basement which he called the Chamber of Secrets and since I hadn’t read the second book yet I had to assume that was what it meant.

About one day later the exterminators came. I knew they were exterminators because they said SWAT on there jackets and that is what I use to get rid of flies.

The SWAT took me in there truck and back home saying I had some weird thing called “Stockholm Syndrome”.

Anyways, that’s when I realized. The book said Hogwarts was a boarding school! But I only went for one day!

Bill is hot, and unpopular opinion which is all this basically is, Percy deserved better. Can not stand this book dont even waste your time, it made me stop wanting to read for 5 years. Worst decision of my life was forcing myself to read this."
490,491,1,"*MI OPINIÓN ES SUBJETIVA, ENTIENDO PORQUE PARA MUCHA GENTE ESTE LIBRO SEA UN ICONO RN LA LITERATURA""

Hubo bastantes cosas que no me gustaron:
-Muchas situaciones/eventos que ocurrieron siento que pasaron solamente para darle una razón al final más que para aportar a la trama
-Muchas contracciones con los personajes o eventos
-Mucha discriminación, más que nada sobre el físico de algunos personajes(ese gordo-odio si que se puede ver). Bueno=bello/hegemónico, malo=feo . La ""excepción"" podría ser Hadrid, pero es el estereotipo del gordo que está como alivio cómico.
-Estoy segura que este libro no pasaría la prueba de Test de Bechdel (esto es solo una observación)
-No me aguanto muchos clichés, y menos que menos el del ""poder del amor"" (perdón, pero son muchos niveles de cringe para mí)"
491,492,1,"This book meant a lot to me when I was 11. I remember enjoying the writing. You don't need a review from me to form an opinion on it; it's presence in pop culture is ubiquitous. It's only here, and getting 1 star, because I'm feeding the Good Reads algorithm, and I never want to see it or it's ilk pop up in my recommended again.
Thank you to the books for what they encouraged in my child self, with their readable prose and very malleable world that shaped many of my early experiences with internet and fandom. That said, the books themselves are very mediocre and didn't much stand up to any rereading. Actual text pleasant, story flimsy and full of things that as an adult just make me tired. And the less said about their author, the better."
492,493,1,"I used to love these books. I read them in elementary school and they were my entire life for a long time. Looking back on them now, however, and there are so many flaws in everything that I used to think was spectacular world building.
There’s racism, both undercover and blatantly obvious in the characters. All of the goblins are antisemitic caricatures and stereotypes. Don’t get me started on the world building.
Just because there is a lot of world building does mean it is good world building. The currency makes no sense, some of the plot points have major holes.
So let alone the fact that JK Rowling is a transphobic piece of shit who ruined my childhood, the books were never really that good anyways."
493,494,1,"It is full of words that are scary even if they are not used in that manner. Withcraft, sorcery, potions, spells, and on and on. However, my rating is in the attitude of the characters. It seems revengeful, mean and Harry even says he hates fellow students and teachers. I think what Lewis disliked about school stories is here in full force. Sure, Harry has a couple of good friends and friendship is applauded, thus I cannot say it is all horrid. But the lack of respect for authority and constant breaking of rules without consequence coupled with spite filled ventures is too much for me. I've only read one book but simply cannot recommend."
494,495,1,My opinion is that this is a book I love to read soooo please let me read this book cause it is being sooooo stupid and it is not letting me read it but otherwise I love it sooooooo much y'all should go read it and rate it a 5 and this isn't a review and hagrid has a new pet and it breaths fire sorry if I should the book a lil but I love it and no can't make me stop loving it if u love it say but otherwise if u hate it don't talk to me cause the rest of my class loves it so if u don't will bye haters but I love this book and I will always love it soo goodbye and have a great rest of your day byeeee
495,496,1,"I absolutely loved this series and found it wonderfully entertaining. There were so many twists and turns; things I saw coming and things some threw me for a loop. While I did have my favorite books and favorite characters (and some not-so-faves) I was pretty much pleased with the entire collection.

I recently had the opportunity to visit Universal Studios in Florida. I wasn't expecting much since I don't typically watch a lot of movies. But, I must say that I was extremely impressed with the Harry Potter worlds of Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley! It is an absolute requirement to enjoy the over-the-top sweetness of a frozen Butter Beer!"
496,497,1,"I never had any desire to read these books but my son was asking to read the series so I read the first one to check it out. I found it to be a disappointing experience. The writing was clunky and juvenile, the characters not well developed, and there were unnecessarily gory moments/scenes that are inappropriate for a children’s book.

The first half read like a straight Roald Dahl rip-off, which if the book gets any credit for being well-written, must be why. Perhaps the books get better as the series goes, but it’s hard for me to understand why anyone would keep reading past the first, let alone why this is considered by so many to be a beloved children’s modern classic."
497,498,1,"I cannot sit down and finish this book. It is so bad. J.K. Rowling is a bad author and the movies are so much better than the actual book. I hate the way that she writes because there are so many words on the page with no substance at all. It seems like she is a high school student trying to meet the word count on an English assignment or that she is trying to be all deep and mysterious when she is just bad. She lacks the basic skills to be a decent writer, not a good writer, I'm talking about middle school level. I will never read another J.K. Rowling book ever again because I know I will waste away waiting all eternity to find the motivation to read even one word on the page."

499,500,1,"I read this as a child and I find the whole premise contemptible. It is a glorification of the public school system in Britain, it is not good writing, and the woman that wrote it is transphobic. I have read most of the books in this series but was forced to give up when it became so repetitive and poorly written that I could not stand to read another word- this (incidentally) was long before I was even fully aware of transphobia, because I was about 9 years of age, and so there is no bias here- of course I don’t like J.K Rowling now that her bigotry has so obviously come to light, but I have always disliked her books."
500,501,1,"TERF

501,502,1,"Ok so don’t kill me or anything guys but I had to DNF this.
As a kid growing up in a strict Christian household I was never allowed to read or watch anything pertaining to Harry Potter. I tried to read this but it just wasn’t for me. I found the reading to be very ‘babyish.’ Also, I’m understanding this was obviously meant for young readers so maybe I’m not totally fair in judging this so hard. Although, I did get at least 70% through and it still didn’t do it for me. I did however, end up watching the movie which I actually liked. The books are just obviously not going to be for me."
502,503,1,
503,504,1,"The whole series contains support for antisemitism, fatphobia, and racism.

JKR participates in White Supremacy, including her active transphobia. I stand with Trans people. I stand with Jewish people.

Any argument for “separating the art from the artist” is a blunt confession that your nostalgia overshadows marginalized people’s rights. This argument is meant for critically consuming Mia by dead artists. JKR is alive, and every penny she makes is proof of support for her and her hateful actions and words.

There are better magic/fantasy books to give your kids."
504,505,1,"لا أعلم حقيقة إن كان الخلل مني أم من التهويل الإعلامي المرافق لاسم ""هاري بوتر""، رفعت سقف توقعاتي جداً بناء على ما كنت قد سمعت عن روعة الرواية أو حتى عن روعة الفيلم بأجزائه المتعددة، توقعت كما عادتي أن أمسك الرواية وأن أتلهف لمعرفة ماذا سيحدث وكيف ستسير الأحداث تباعاً لأصل للنهاية بيوم أو على الأكثر ثلاثة، لكن الحال لم يكن هكذا هنا، منذ عدة أشهر بدأت بالرواية لكني لم أستطع حتى الوصول إلى منتصفها.
للأسف لم تعجبني أبداً لقد كانت من أسوء ما قرأت يوماً
خيبت ظنوني"
505,506,1,"very good. this is actually written based on a personal experience of mine from about 2 years ago, y'know, back in my day. But im super stoked that they turned it inot a book, i mean ngl it was kinda scary watching ron risk his life in a life sized wizards chess game... NOT ME MOT HERMIONE, YOOU. yeah. anyway. read it because i think its kind of swag and, did anyone die in this book? I mean real life event... they didnt die for nothing go read it."
506,507,1,"This book teaches kids sorcery! My child read this book front to back and is yelling Latin spells at the cat with a fork trying to “levitate” it. This book is a danger to the younger generation by teaching them witchcraft! When I tell you I had fun soaking the book in lighter fluid and lighting it up it's an enormous understatement. I decided to read the first chapter and was shocked at the levels of profanity, nudity, and cursing featured. Don't let anyone you don't want to turn into a hippie delinquent read this rubbish!"
507,508,1,Too sorry to say I had to give up on this. Fab narration fab story but just not for me. I had missed out on the phenomenon but having seen Stephen fry interviewed recently I thought now really is the time to see what it's all about. I really hoped this would be the first book of 7 I'd listen to but I just had no interest after the first 3 chapters (which were great) . I can see why it's so popular but as I said just not for me.
508,509,1,"I know I'm in the extreme minority of people who don't think this book is great but... It's really not. It's full of cliches and Deus Ex Machinas. So much filler. Really unimaginative and rambling world building. Two dimensional characters. Fat shaming, and later books in the series are just flat out racist. And at the end of the day it's just about a white guy who is the best at everything. I don't get the hype!"
509,510,1,"Poorly written. Overhyped. Mediocre at best. If you want a good wizarding school series at any age, try The Worst Witch by Jill Murphy, or Tales from Earthsea by Ursula K Le Guin. For a hilarious, exquisitely written series involving wizards and magic, read Terry Pratchett's Discworld series.

(just because it's written for children doesn't mean it needs to be poorly written. See: The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien for exemplary children's literature)"
510,511,1,"Don't read this, it sucks. A good alternative is Just Lovers (Like We Were Supposed To Be) on A03. It's basically like this but not problematic, boring and with a shit-amount of plotholes. Also if you're looking for something long to read and that's why you're even entertaining the thought of suffering through this abomonation of a book series, try out All The Young Dudes. That too is available on AO3.

anyways, stay safe out there and bye."
511,512,1,"I absolutely do not get the hype around this book nor this series.

Harry is so fcking annoying I wanted to punch him. He seems like constantly act like a dormat I wanted to shake him and yell at him to grow some balls.

And ya’ll trying to say he’s so young, I’ll remind you Percy Jackson is the same age in his first books but still had a lot more guts than this rat.

Sorry not sorry!! Because I’ve been lied too!!"
512,513,1,"I read Harry Potter as a teenager (first book when I was 11), so I feel like I grew up with the gang in a way. I never owned any memorabilia or anything, but I adored the stories and characters. A few years ago, I bought the first 3 books from a used bookstore in French because I thought it would be a good way to practice, and after starting to reread I started noticing some odd peculiarities that evaded me when I was younger, like the general stratification of creatures (most of which are very human-like), and while she does deal with that in the elf liberation, the hierarchies with goblins, centaurs, etc is never addressed. But mostly, I am enraged that a modern woman wrote a book and created a world where all of the most powerful characters are men, with the exception of Hermione, whose exceptionality is shoved down your throat, as if to be a respected woman in the wizard world, you have to be the absolute best. I mean, I suppose it’s a more accurate depiction for how society actually is, but this female writer had an opportunity to create a world that was better for women, and she blew it."
513,514,1,"I dislike fantasy as is, and so I went in knowing it wasn't going to be my favorite anyways. So many people had told me how great the book was, and so I had extremely high expectations, and I have to say I disliked it so much that I spent two whole months trying to get through this book. I personally think it is overhyped."
514,515,1,Tengo todos los libros que saco Salamandra en español. Y ahora por fin una versión digital para cuando estemos de viaje!! Yo los compre cuando estaba en la Universidad y se lo leí a mi primera hija desde q estaba en mi vientre ahora ya tiene 15 años. Mi hijo de 6 años está leyendo el primero. Me encantaría q fuese la versión ilustrada
515,516,1,"i didnt really like it tha much im so sorry

i think the plot itself is pretty decent, and the characters are nice, but i think ive left it too long to read the harry potter series and now jkr's style just feels like a very low reading level

if id tried reading it a few years ago i would have probably loved it !! but right now it's just a little too basic and repetitive for my tastes :("
516,517,1,The Harry Potter series is so mediocre. It just became popular and some people became emotionally attached to the characters. There have been allegations of JK Rowlings's anti-semitism and hatred against transgender people. How can you in good conscience support an author who espouses hate against people who just want to be their true selves?
517,518,1,"I really liked harry potter, and I think it's a 4 stars, but I don't support the author as she is a transphobe and bad person. I know this is about the book, but I don't want to give J.K rowling the satisfaction of my 4 stars, but very good. I don't like it as much as Percy Jackson, but I think if I read this first, it might've been a 4.5"
518,519,1,"i did not like this book one bit. i was bored the entire time. i watched the movie before reading this, and i’m so glad that i did or else i wouldn’t have finished the book. this book was good for when it first came out, but not in todays age. i think i’m wayyyy to grown for them. i’m not going to read the rest of the series. this was enough for me"
519,520,1,"Originally, I wasn’t into Harry Potter. But with the antisemitic and transphobic behavior of the author, it is disgusting that companies are still partnering up with her and making merch of her stuff.

520,521,1,"It baffles me that this book is rated so much higher than Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin. Harry Potter is a great series for younger kids to read, but it loses its charm the older you get. Wizard of Earthsea is a book that is much more intelligently written while still being accessible to young children. While the school of magic in Harry Potter is a fun and interesting setting, it just sucks after book 4. Wizard of Earthsea has a whole entire world that you get to explore alongside the characters. Its world building is absolutely amazing. It even has a map at the start of each book of the area the book talks about. Ursula Le Guin also is not a terrible human being like J. K. Rowling is. J. K. Rowling is a no good very bad terf who doesnt deserve anything in life. If you genuinely support her as a person, go fuck yourself. TL;DR skip this, read Wizard of Earthsea."
521,522,1,"Es beginnt wie die Geschichte von Aschenputtel. Und er ist weiterhin das großartige Kind, das alles gut macht und Glück hat. Er ist der Beste im Besenfliegen und alles ist in Ordnung.

Es ist merkwürdig, wie der Hintergrund des Romans die Institutionen des Anglo-Systems bestätigt: Geld, Erbschaft, Studiengebühren, Schweigen, um den Job nicht zu verlieren und alles andere."
522,523,1,"Not my cup of tea. Defiantly not for adults and geared towards children. Read this for my younger child of 6. Not too sure what she thought of it. Part of it kept her intrigued but various parts she would need to be older to keep her attention or liking to it.
I did not care for it much at all"
523,524,1,"My son is reading this to his five year old daughter for her bedtime story. It was fun to Facetime with my granddaughter and talk about the book, but I frankly don't see the appeal. I'm way too old for it, but would do about anything for my little granddaughter and she loved it."
524,525,1,"UGH! This book frustrates me, there was not one mention of hair nor pottery in the whole entire book, very disappointing, why call it harry and pottery, if it isn't in the book, all this dumb book is about is magic and flying brooms, wouldn't reccomend."
525,526,1,"I'm so mortified that the books were such a big part of many young adult's childhoods as they are full of slavery, racism, homophobia, and - big surprise - transphobia. Rowling doesn't deserve half of what she has, and should have awards she has removed."
526,527,1,Imagine reading this as a Jew and realizing that antisemitic stereotypes are just a central part of the book. The goblins really did not have to be hook-nosed greedy bankers and I really would like to see us not portrayed like that.
527,528,1,"Fuck JK Rowling. TERF piece of shit. Not to mention there’s many cases of racism, sexism, & homophobia in this book series that honestly makes this series even less fun to read these days.

So yeah find another book series. Can’t believe I once loved this."
528,529,1,"I read this before JK Rowling revealed herself as a transphobe, and I tried reading the series just because of all of the hype. I didn't finish the 5th book, but I got through all the books before it. The narration style just kind of had a condescending tone that I didn't like."
529,530,1,"Harry Potter is amazing, JK Rowling is… well, not evil, but not quite good. If a creator is doing harmful things, still support the work (as long as it’s not offensive), not the creator (unless they’ve had a GENUINE change of heart.

Just wanted to say this."
530,531,1,"I don't know if I'm being ""biased"" because JK is a bigot but homegirl can't really write huh.

I read this when I was kid and the movies were coming out, I loved it. Thought I would reread as an adult because I remembered very little. Turns out its meant to be read as kid (or never)."
531,532,1,"It feels so entertaining, but it's actually so boring. I think JK Rowling is a creative person but lacks genuine imagination. She has designed everything to appear magical, but there is no magical substance."
532,533,1,"Obligatory 1* review bc Joanne is a hateful shrew.

I wasn't overly impressed so I'd likely give it a 3/5. It's a fine children's book, but didn't grip me as an adult (as you might expect). This re-read made me remember listening to it on tapes as a kid which I did enjoy."
533,534,1,"I guess it's a fun story. I would say that this book is great as a pre-teen book but as an adult novel, it is totally overrated. The writing style was boring and the story is little more than fun. I get that that's what most are looking for."
534,535,1,"Read this as an 11 year old and loved it. But let’s be honest, the beginning is extraordinarily tedious, and both the author and some of the content are problematic. Won’t give my money to the belief systems that taint this magical world."
535,536,1,"Sadly not as good as everyone remembers or believes. The world building is appealing and it has snippets of exciting creatures, but these are mostly stolen from other places. Poorly written and overhyped, a waste of time when so many books do what this aims to do so much better"
536,537,1,"Did not read the book, nor am i planning to.
I just felt the need to tell everyone i will not be available on 5.3.2027 since i will be calling my ex wife to try to convince her to let ne see the kids.
Veronica if you're reading this, please let me see the kids, its been 5 years."
537,538,1,"Countless plot holes, horrible role models, and a bigoted author make this series one of the most frustrating pieces of literature I've ever attempted. I never read it when I was young because it didn't interest me, but I assume the popularity is mostly nostalgia based"
538,539,1,"Sinceramente, creo que no ha sido para nada lo que me esperaba.

Se me ha hecho muy muy pesado y largo, los capítulos son EXCESIVAMENTE extensos, pueden llegar a durar 30 páginas.

En general, la historia está bien, pero se me hizo insoportable :("
539,540,1,I'm funny - I don't like reading books that everyone reads. That said - Harry Potter was meh. Not amazing and not horrible either. I don't really understand why so many people love it. It was ok. The movie was exciting but neither was my favorite.
540,541,1,"So I tried to read this a few years back but find it childish and bland, tried again, trying to see what was the fuss about. A few chapters in, I had to DNF it. IDK if it was the writing style, the turn of events."
541,542,1,"Not my favourite. I was reading it to my daughter, who equally wasn't impressed. Although she loves the idea of wizards she couldn't follow the book and found it slow going. We got 13% through and put it down."
542,543,1,"I love the Harry Potter series, the universe JK Rowling has created with it, and I know it's said to ""seperate the art from the artist"", but especially as a trans person myself, I can't help but look at the series in a very different way that I did since I was younger"
543,544,1,"People always say this book is the greatest of all. The whole series even. In reality. The story is good but the writing is terrible.
Not to mention the writer is a transphobe.
It’s just not that good."
544,545,1,"Controversial opinion, but I don't like Harry Potter. I tried to read it as a child and didn't like it then. I recently tried to reread it as an adult and still find it unlikable. I slogged through this book with the hopes that it would get better. Let's see what book two brings. 1/5"

814,815,1,"Welcome to the bleach white world of warthogs's where wizard's re-enact world war two purity politics, but without any of those pesky non-whites or queers! Where women do the work and get a measly weasely for their troubles! Yeah I know ""there's a black girl"" but when you literally name her a color... so much nope.

Oh right, and harry's also the captain of the football team. Er Quidditch. Absolutely dreadful."
815,816,1,"Mediocre writing (generously speaking) by a horrible human being. Good for young readers to learn vocabulary, but the series contains racist ideals cover to cover. Not worth the time, movies are fine."

827,828,1,"My rating is purely my opinion, I personally am not into this series. I couldn't even get through 2 chapters when I was younger I only got through the entire book for my daughter. I'm glad my daughter loves these books and movies just not for me."
828,829,1,"Every blurb or snippet I've ever seen from this series reads like terrible Archive-of-our-Own fanfiction.
The book and series are not seminal in any way, despite how arduously the project managers have attempted to market it as a masterful work of children's fiction and a potential classic of our time."
829,830,1,"took me 8 months to finish half the book, then got bored and dropped it. FLOPPED"
830,831,1,Everyone I talk to loves this book and the series. I was unable to get hooked on it unfortunately.
831,832,1,*_* i like it
832,833,1,this book sucks booty hole.
833,834,1,"OK OK! Good book!
But well ... it does not allow other books such as Magisterium or Magnes Chase to be read by readers (even if some people think they are not as good as Harry Potter!)
So far that the book has been very good. I hope it surprises me more."
834,835,1,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 but one for the transphobe

they did my boy neville so dirty in the movies😭 he was such a good character in the book and only gave him a couple scenes in the movie smh😒 harry and ron were so protective over him tho☹️☹️ wish they added that too"

836,837,1,Stfu
837,838,1,literally so boring 💀💀. I got to page 70 and I couldn't do it any longer
838,839,1,"I remember my first (and last) reading of Harry Potter vividly.

In the 5th grade, my teacher shoved this down my throat as a book I would love. So, I picked it.
I cannot remember anything that happened. I don't think I'd remember Harry's name if it wasn't on the cover. It was slow, so slow it fascinated me! In my 11-year-old mind, I couldn't understand how a book about British witches was THIS boring. I forced myself to finish the book and decided that I would never read a Harry Potter book again. I have stayed true to that promise.

Also, the author is a transphobic little shit who's trying to see how many stereotypes she can fit into one book series. Don't read Harry Potter I promise better books exist. Also, I did not care for Draco."
839,840,1,"i didn't liked it , it wasn't that interesting."
840,841,1,"loved the book, just hate the author"
841,842,1,jkr is a terf
842,843,1,"If there's a type of person on this planet more annoying than obsessive harry potter fans, I haven't met them yet."
843,844,1,These books are badly written and some of the plots don’t make sense. I never understood the hype about Harry Potter. Also lets not support a transphobic author!
844,845,1,Just not my favorite book. Not my style...
845,846,1,"Años después sigo sin entender el éxito de un libro soporífero, cuyo protagonista resentido no duda en vengarse de los familiares con los que vivió."
846,847,1,"The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling is one of the most widely read series in the world. The first in the series of seven, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is a very different book, because it puts magic in the place of regular humans, or muggles. I think that there is a good degree of action and mystery in this book, but no romance yet. I think there will possibly be romance in the later books, but not for another one or two. The book is about Harry, a regular boy, who finds out he is a wizard and gets accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He finds out about a valuable stone that has gone missing. He tries to retrieve it, and succeeds in the end, only after a heart-stopping a detailed fight with Professor Quirrel, who Voldermort has chosen to rest his soul in.
“ ‘Ah, go boil yer heads, the both of yeh,’ said Hagrid. ‘Harry – yer a wizard.’” When Harry was told what and who he really is, he was skeptical, and didn’t believe Hagrid at first. But after thinking about it for a while, Harry joins the dots, and realized all the incidents where something strange happened without him meaning to was actually his magical powers that were not yet under his control. He is then excited, and finds out, when Hagrid takes him to Diagon Alley to buy supplies for Hogwarts, that his parents left him a great amount Galleons, wizarding money. However, his soon-to-be best friend is poor, and looks up to Harry like he is some sort of king.
“ ‘You-Know-Who killed ‘em. An’ then – an’ this is the real myst’ry of the thing – he tried to kill you, too.’” When Harry find out how his parents actually died, he is in shock. His parents did not die in a car crash like his uncle and aunt told him, they were brutally murdered by Lord Voldemort. Voldemort did not actually intend to kill his parents, he only wanted to kill Harry, because Voldemort heard the Prophecy which stated that someone that had many similarities to Harry was going to kill Voldemort. However, Harry’s mother sacrificed herself for harry thus casting some sort of ancient magical protection over him, and so he became a wizarding celebrity because he is the only one to have survived the killing curse.
Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone kicked off the epic series that is terribly hard to put down. The thing I like most about the series is that however many times you re-read the book, the same suspense, excitement and wonder always hits me. Therefore one can read it over and over again without getting bored. I feel this is a very good quality to have in a book, and also it"
847,848,1,
848,849,1,"racist, highly overrated, not even that original"
849,850,1,One star as an obligation to lower J.K. Rowling's score.
850,851,1,i hate this website it will not read anithing
851,852,1,EW. I wish I could rate it 0. I DESPISE this book and any other book in this series.Horrible.Boring.NO!
852,853,1,Cringe
853,854,1,"The only way I could give this a worse review is if I was bornagain christian and I felt that witches and wizards were the work of Satan, which is not good. This book is not the work of Satan. It is just piss poor work."
854,855,1,"let me start this off by stating I don't particularly hate anyone who's parents are dead. I do however have a deep hatred for redheads.

the entire concept of a 'chosen one' being this amazing wizard is a cliche i've seen at least a million times, mrs. jk. first of all, i think harry's caretakers were right to shove him under the stairs and treat him how they did. if i was asked to take in a whinny, sniveling brat i'd be angry too. harry potter has the consistent expression of “stupid bitch who's drowning in plot armor"".

when harry was taken away by the fat goblin looking guy, i was really hoping it'd become one of those cold cases where a child is kidnapped and never found. hagrid would be doing the world a favor. in fact, i believe hagrid would've ate harry if this was realistic. the man is so fat he most likely affects the earths tectonic plates. oh, hagrids going down the stairs? an earthquake begins in california. hagrids breathing heavily to catch his breath? a tornado forms instantly. he is the sole reason for natural disasters in this world. hagrid doesnt even need a wand, he can enter a room and it'd have the same affect as the invisibility cloak, but instead of working for him, his shadow just hides everyone else.

the worst part about this entire series is the fact a redhead, in a family full of redheads, even exists. ron is a pussy. he whines the entire time and suddenly acts like everyone else is the worst for getting mad at him. like, ron, dude, everyones mad at you bc ur awful. hes disgusting, extremely hard on the eyes and i'd even say he's repulsive."
855,856,1,"This book was a DNF for me, I got bored immediately and found it hard to read and actually enjoy myself."
856,857,1,"These are just notes for a university essay that I want to save for future use.


1. Harry is an orphaned boy living with his unloving aunt, uncle, and cousin. As the story progresses he learns that he’s a wizard and has been invited to learn at a magical school called Hogwarts. While there, strange happenings occur and Harry and his two friends, Ron and Hermione, begin to piece together a mystery the adults around them don’t want them to know. They realize that the evil Lord Voldemort (who killed Harry’s parents and tried to kill him) isn’t entirely dead and is trying to use the Philosopher’s Stone to come back to life—a stone currently being hidden in Hogwarts. Believing that none of the adults will listen to them the three try to stop Voldemort on their own.
2. The Harry Potter series is an internationally popular series written in the 1990s-early-2000s that’s still internationally known and loved.
3. Magic is steeped into J.K. Rowling’s world, allowing for much consideration of how magic is presented and much for children to play with. The story starts with Harry in a state of disempowerment where he is punished for his magical ability, he is unheard and punished for any perceived infraction. This magic allows him some empowerment, still (growing his hair back, escaping from bullies, etc). Entering the magical world (and especially Hogwarts rights like Article 16, the right to privacy, and Article 12, the right to be heard can be played with. When Harry isn’t heard by adults he must use magic to out-manoeuvre their magic. There’s a lot to Harry Potter’s magical world and its magic."
857,858,1,"Having read it for the first time in 15 years, I must say this book is just... really bad.

(1) All of the characters are one-dimensional, have sparse physical descriptions and no development throughout the story.

(2) The magic system is incoherent and not well thought out at all.

(3) The world itself is poorly built and smells of lack of imagination and originality.

(4) 3 11-year old children with zero to no practical magical experience manage to pass through traps set up by the best magicians in the world in no time. Sure.

(5) We have the ending where the bad guy needlessly explains his motivations and sheds light on questions HP has had. Again, for no good reason at all. And then his minion attacks HP... with his bare hands, instead of with his wand.

(6) There is magician's chess. Which is actually just regular chess... but with living figures or something. Again, poor imagination.

(7) HP gets on the broom for the first time and suddenly he's the best catcher in a century. And somehow his delinquent behavior is excused by MM who, in other cases, doesn't hesitate to chastise or subtract house points. Oh, and she gets him a cool new broom.

(8) Dumbledoor is the greatest magician in modern history... but failed to recognize that Voldemort was under his nose for an entire year.

(9) There's no logic to the way professors decide how to award / subtract house points. It seems like JKR decided the point dedication on the fly.

These are just some of the things that I did not like about this book. Hopefully, the next installments in the series will be as I remember them - getting progressively better."
858,859,1,"JK Rowling's other pen-name is Robert Galbraith. Who was he? Robert Galbraith Heath (May 9, 1915 �� September 21, 1999) was an American psychiatrist.[1][2] He followed the theory of biological psychiatry that organic defects were the sole source of mental illness,[3] and that consequently mental problems were treatable by physical means. He published 425 papers and three books.[4][5][6] One of his first papers is dated 1946.[7] He was profiled as a ""famous American psychiatrist"" in 1983 by Psychiatric Annals.[8]

Heath founded the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Tulane University, New Orleans, in 1949 and remained its chairman until 1980.[4][9][10] He performed many experiments there involving electrical stimulation of the brain via surgically implanted electrodes. He placed deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes into the brains of more than 54 patients.[11][12][13][14] Indeed, he has been cited as the first, or one of the first, researcher(s) to have placed electrodes deep into the brains of living human patients.[15][1] It has been suggested that this work was financed in part by the government, particularly the CIA or U.S. military.[16][17][18]

In 1972, he claimed to have converted a homosexual man to heterosexuality using DBS.[13][19] Heath also experimented with psychosurgery, the drug bulbocapnine to induce stupor, and LSD,[20][21][22] using African-American prisoners in the Louisiana State Penitentiary as experimental subjects.[23] He worked on schizophrenia patients, which he regarded as an illness with a physical basis.[24] Today Heath's work is considered highly controversial and is only rarely used as reference material.[1][25][26]"
859,860,1,"Not gonna lie, I love this book. I grew up with the series, this was the first ‘big’ book I ever read. But I can’t support J K Rowling. So if your are gonna read it PLEASE PLEASE buy/get it second hand ."
860,861,1,"I read a book called Harry Potter and the Philosopher 19s Stone. It is written by J.K. Rowling. This book is in a series of 7 books, and is the first one out of them all. The genre of the book is probably action because many big and crazy events happen in the book. I chose to read this book because my sister has read the series and wanted me to try it out too because she enjoyed it so much.

This book is about a boy named Harry Potter. His parents died from an evil wizard named Voldemort when he was a baby. He lives with his aunt and uncle, but they treat him very poorly. Voldemort 19s mission is to kill Harry Potter, and Harry gets invited to a wizard school, called Hogwarts and meets many new friends. This book has magic, evil, drama, heros and much more. You will have to read it to find out if Harry Potter defeats Voldemort. The setting is mainly at Hogwarts, Harry 19s school.

I, personally did not enjoy this book very much. The plot was boring for me, magic is just not my type of thing and it is not interesting for me. It took a long time for me to finish it, because I was not enjoying it. I am not sure if I will continue reading the series, I think I will to see if it gets better and I will try to read it faster. I think this book is for anyone who likes magic and wizardry, for any age who loves reading. I would probably give this book a 3/10, I did not enjoy so much, it was just not my type."
861,862,1,"This book was ok. It was really slow at the start, but don't be discouraged. The others get much better."
862,863,1,"Saying this would probably get me killed, but here it is. This book is terrible. Cloud your eyes as much as you want, but the fact of the matter is, this is a child's book, and should be treated as such. The plot is extremely predictable, watered down, and weak. The character's have no growth, and even at the beginning, the poor traumatized orphan boy who is exploited and the victim who we should care about and pity was too much of a cry for attention, and even with this terrible start by page twelve he's an immortal god. He peaked in growth for the whole series with one sentence, ""You're a wizard Harry."" Even this one sentence can show you the terrible dialogue. Its not even British, c'mon! If everyone was written in with cocknyed accents the dialogue, while shamefully bad, would still be better then this emotionless, empty, tiny diction. I got more out of Green Eggs and Ham. At least Dr. Seuss had a gimmick and made the whole book rhyme. All ranting aside, I ask you, nay I plead to you, if you haven't read this book, don't. Don't give in the mindless horde shoving this book down your throat, don't listen the immature mass of small brained fad followers. Your better than them just by not reading this!"
863,864,1,"Book Review
I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, it was about a young wizard named Harry who’s parents were killed by and evil wizard when he was very young. “A giant man was standing in the door way. His face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy maine of hair and a wild, tangled beard.” That man named Hagrid was the one who found and took care of Harry till he got him to the Dursley’s for them to take care of. The lead characters in the novel, were Harry being the most important, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid, because they appeared most throughout the story. The plot of the story was pretty well developed, some parts of the story ran on a bit which made the story not as interesting.
In my opinion the author did a good job on some parts of the book but a mediocre on others. The book did not change my opinion on anything or move me in any way. There was nothing valuable to be learnt in this book. I wouldn’t recommend this book to anyone even though others would, it just wasn’t a good book in my mind.
If I was given the chance to rate this book I would give it a 2.5. The book contained some well thought out themes, but overall I thought the book was very dry.s"
864,865,1,"It's hard to rate such a phenomenal book with low stars. But it is what it is to me.

This wasn't the first time i tried to read this book. Early 2000s, I borrowed this book from a friend but couldn't get through half the pages. I thought it wasn't for me. But this time I gave it a try one more time. Unfortunately, still wasn't for me.

Plus point is that this book builds imagination with such fairytale world. Well, the movie is out there already so I can perfectly imagining the characters and the setting (Oxford enormous building!) as I read the book.

I know it's somehow a mistake to give high adults expectations to such children book. For children Harry and his friends might be such heroes but for me they're just little rascal (especially Harry) with such luck and privilege to get them do anything as they like (even it means breaking the rules) and still earn points for their not-so-good behavior. Oh, and Harry is famous, we got that already. But for what reason is still not clear for me.

All in all, I really am so sorry to say that this book didn't work for me. Maybe it's just me. Would I try to read the rest of the series...? I don't think so but maybe I will. Who knows."
865,866,1,"I never thought this book was quite worth the hype.

Since I first read it at the tender young age of seven, my feelings surrounding this book were sort of blandly positive. It served its purpose. It held my attention, provided me with some baseline entertainment, and didn’t invoke any feelings of extreme rage or horror. It’s was good, but certainly not the best. And that opinion stood for a majority of my life. I didn’t think it deserved its label as one of ""the best fantasy books of all time""; but I did enjoy my time reading it.

AND THEN ALLLLLL THAT CHANGED.

If I didn’t share my copy of Harry Potter with my sister, and if I had regular access to a controlled open flame, I would immediately burn this book. How much pleasure it would bring me to watch the insatiable flames devour this disgrace to humanity. Oh, to watch it's pages curl and blacken, to smell the crisp, pungent odor of dying pages, to imagine the wretched ink and paper and cover screaming for help. Burning this book would feed my empty soul. Not even my utmost respect for books would save this sorry excuse for a novel from the fiery pit of certain death because I, much like ninety percent of human beings on this watery round planet, have anger issues.

So LET'S GO.

[Review to be continued later]"
866,867,1,I know a lot of people are going to hate me for this one but..this book was complete and utter ass🤷‍♀️
867,868,1,"This must be one of the most unpopular opinions out there, but there were very few books I just couldn't finish as a kid. I even read Mark Spark in the Dark multiple times because I forgot to remove it from my reading folder and I assure you, I hated that book. I found Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone so unbearably dull and bogged down with unnecessary, droning scenes that I couldn't get past the first three chapters. I tried skipping to later ones in case it ever got going. It didn't, or maybe it did and I just happened to land at another scene in which Harry and friends watched paint dry. On the one occasion I took this book to school, I just pretended to read it. Harry had so little personality that I struggled to even feel sorry for him. I actually loved the film back then – it captured the magical feeling that the book totally failed to deliver to me and, more importantly, it only included scenes that actually added to the story. This book made little me question whether I even liked reading anymore, so I guess I can compliment it for evoking a strong reaction."
868,869,1,"I was *finally* convinced to try reading this book in about 2010, after many years of being completely uninterested in the Harry Potter phenomenon. Until then, everyone I had seen reading the book had, I felt, a mental age of about 7, so when my partner badgered me into picking it up, claiming that it was fantastic, that he, his sister, their parents and numerous friends had read, an thoroughly enjoyed it, I caved in.

Wow.

It was tripe. I struggled to make it to page 30. I hated the Dursleys, I hated Harry, I wanted to punch Hermione in her stupid buck teeth.

I am a HUGE fan of physical books and treat mine very well, rarely a creased spine in my house unless the book is HUGE and then there are some signs that it has been read - however, after giving up at the end of perhaps the sixth chapter, I wanted to tear this book to pieces and burn it. The only thing that stopped me is that it wasn't my book and I'll be damned if I was going to spend my money to replace it.

I know that my opinion clearly differs from pretty much everyone else in the world, but I could quite happily die this afternoon, never having finished even one book, let alone the entire series."
869,870,1,"I originally gave this book four stars for the good writing and original premise, but I had to edit this because, months after reading it, I'm still upset by it.

Allow me to elaborate: I was fine with this book up until the ending. It was original and cute, and while not the best book in the world, it had promise. Until the very last pages. The ending is one of the worst, ever. I feel like everyone's read Harry Potter, but just in case, what I'm about to discuss (the ending) would be considered a spoiler.

So basically, the Slytherin House wins all the points (fairly, I might add), until Dumbledore FREAKING CHEATS and gives gratuitous points to Harry, Hermoine, and Ron for bravery and other nonsense AFTER THE WINNER HAS ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED AND MAKES THEIR HOUSE ""WIN.""

This would bother me anyway, but it REALLY bothers me because this is a kids book, and it gives a totally wrong message to them: that the good guys always win. 1) No, they don't, kids. 2) Especially not by cheating. 3) Slytherin won, fair and square. Why was it wrong that they won, because they weren't the main characters? That's so ridiculously stupid."
870,871,1,LOL not good
871,872,1,"These books are all trash, if you like them as an adult it is because you are a solipsistic uneducated philistine, and if you are a parent who encourages your kids to read this garbage, you are a bad parent.

There are zero redeeming features about these books. They are written to be easily readable by someone with zero literary knowledge or experience. They appeal to the vilest instincts of pride in each reader. None of the characters has any real virtue or appeal other than the villain who at least wants to destroy all of them. Possibly with the evil totalitarian racist villain in charge, the preposterously stupid wave-your-wand magic would be used to do something like cure cancer or travel to distant stars, rather than making brooms fly.

If you want to give your kids something good to read lead them to the Edgar Rice Burroughs novels, which are about larger-than-life heroes who yet retain their humanity, who struggle to be good and virtuous as best they can, and who inhabit stories that are simple and honest pulp, not recycled recycled toilet paper of literary cliches."
872,873,1,"Finally getting around to reading the full series. Obviously I know quite a bit about this series and have even picked up the books a couple of times never having finished or started much of them. While in quarantine though.... treated myself to the box set and have just finished Sorcerer's Stone.

I just finished a couple of books and realized all of the movies are on a streaming service. Questioning whether or not I should go ahead and start reading (knowing I probably won't finish most of the series before they are taken off that service) or just put it off until next year. Carpe Librum!!

You ever pick up a book and after a reading a few chapters you get a flash of reading it to your future children? That's how I feel right now. I can't wait to finish the whole series and then once I have kids read it to them while not trying to give away the twists and turns.

I can honestly say I was surprised by the ending! Can't wait to dive into Chamber of Secrets!!"
873,874,1,"In England of 1700 AD, a man would get burned on the stake for practising magic because magic is one of the most severe heresies, full-stop.
It is 2000 AD and winter is coming. Every child in England, big or small, is now waiting to receive its special letter from Hogwarts. Harry Potter has just become the latest trend, everyone is talking and going crazy about it... Parents wait in lines to buy the last copies of the book «The Philosopher Stone». What a surprise Christmas present that would be! And what better gift to give your child on this holy day that Christians have!... The hysteria is real. Kids wave sticks around like they are wizards!... As long as they are happy... who cares about Christianity anyway. Didn't Darwin say we're like the last chain of the evolution too? And they didn't have science back then and we know better than and our IQ is more high and our education is more better and woemen have rights and"
874,875,1,"I think I may be the only one who never got into Harry Potter. I found the text very wordy and was a genre of fantasy that I never understood. I sometimes feel badly that my aversion to this book kept the magic away from my children. They weren't interested in reading it because it was too long and while I read them many, many other long books, this one never made it to my list. Maybe my grandchildren will be more adventurous and select a Harry Potter book to read...if they do, I will keep my opinions to myself!"
875,876,1,"In my opinion, this book tends to drag, and it's possible that I may not be the target audience since I already possess a basic understanding of the world through my engagement with the fandom. Unfortunately, the story seems to lack a sense of urgency and fails to maintain my interest.

Nevertheless, I am willing to give the series a fair chance and intend to complete it whenever I come across copies in charity shops. I've heard positive feedback regarding the later instalments, suggesting improvements that may enhance the overall reading experience.

However, it's important to mention that this book does contain some questionable elements, which become increasingly problematic as more information is revealed. Specifically, certain aspects concerning the goblins left me feeling uncomfortable. Additionally, there were numerous comments about the professor's turban that struck me as insensitive and unsettling. These instances added to my unease while reading."
876,877,1,"No. Just no. I can't handle all the scatter-brained, Harry heads that swarm to defend this god-awful series.

I read this one, and never looked back to the series. It was THAT bad. And that was when I was in my ""bad book"" phase, when I read anything and everything and cared not for the quality.

Later, I actually watched all the movies. Even if I can't get into the books (which is rare) I can usually enjoy the movies... except with this series. The movies weren't all that engaging and I did not enjoy them much. The storyline was fairly worn out, overused, and plain died out at parts.

Now, if you're going to yell at me for my opinion, please actually use the English language and the grammar that goes with it. You don't help your case with competent reviewers if your comment is filled with ""U dnt no wat ur sayin""."
877,878,1,"I really tried to read this book but it was so childish and definitely not my style.
I wouldn’t let my children read it, mainly because Harry sets a horrible example with him constantly going against the rules and being rewarded for it, especially because he is “special” is just wrong. He also didn’t have to work to gain any of his abilities, which teaches kids that they don’t have to strive towards anything. He has an enormous amount of money so he can have whatever, whenever he wants. I don’t think this series would be horribly terrible, for those who enjoy witches, wizards and magic, it’s just the amount of stupidly unnecessary hype everywhere making everyone think this must be a really good book because it is everywhere! It has zero life lessons and zero role models, making this book purely for entertainment purposes only."
878,879,1,"A LOT of people have slammed the Harry Potter books as ""intelectually not challenging enough to feed to a potato slug"" and similar. However, this book has a special place on my shelf. After reading lord of the rings (did i say reading? i should maybe have said torturing through - took me a year, since i got so bored with the book), i gave up on reading. From never reading less than 50 pages a day (most days a LOT more), to not reading a single book for 3 years after LOTR. Finally gave Harry Potter a try. And couldn't put it down. Sure, it's not a 1984, or a catch 22 or similar, but this book got me back into the world of reading. Each of the subsequent books also got consumed in hours rather than days. Such easy to read books, with stories that can keep young and old enthralled."
879,880,1,"This is a moving story that the whole world knows and you don't even need to read the book for this story. Its about the great adventure of harry potter as he discovers who he really is and goes on the adventure of a life time. Born in a family of wizards, Harry is the only survivor from the attack by Lord Voldemore. Given away as a child, harry has no clue about his back ground until he goes to Hogwarts. There he becomes best friends with people like Ron and others. As they go on in there first year, Harry realizes something wrong. The subject "" the sorcerers stone"" is brought up a ton of times. Harry looks for the object that is said to be legend but finds instead the person who made him who he is today. This is a must read but little confusing."
880,881,1,"1/5 I know I know I knoooow a lot of you will hate me for this but I have to be honest. J.K. Rowling is a great author, she knows what she's doing. However, I couldn't get into it. There's something about the magic, wands, spells, and riding a broomstick that didn't stick with me. I couldn't get into it. I have tried maybe 5 times in my life to read this series, and I just couldn't do it. Either the plot was too slow or busy, the characters didn't strike me as amazing for something they did. I felt like I could read a better version of this series elsewhere.
Also I am not a person to jump on a bandwagon. I prefer to discover things on my own. Once something is popular, and everyone is into it, I lost interest. It loses it's spark."
881,882,1,"Right then, Harry Potter. A fantastic work of imagination with a compelling story made almost unreadable simply through the way it is written. Script-like in places, this book is (or should be) an incredibly boring read for anyone with a reading age greater than 7 and I found getting through it to the end one hell of a slog. Having watched all the films, I already knew how much fun the story actually is and so was extremely disappointed with the quality of the writing.

I know this book is meant for children, but there are a lot of kids books which are much better written than this one. If you enjoy well constructed sentences and flowing descriptive writing, this book is absolutely not for you, do not waste your time.

Plot - 4/5
Writing 2/5"
882,883,1,"It was an almost fun story. But after having read Le Guin, it just feels like an incredibly childish and simplistic book."
883,884,1,"No me gustó, si bien se le reconoce a la autora que el libro es fácil de leer eso es todo lo que tiene a su favor, ya que aunque la señora tiene imaginación, carece de la disciplina para ponerle reglas a lo que crea, también tiene un problema muy serio para escribir villanos, ya que todos son caricaturas sin un propósito claro, especialmente los Dursley a quienes no pude aguantar no porque fueran malos sino porque están pésimamente escritos hasta rayar en lo absurdo.
Tampoco le va muy bien con las pruebas y obstáculos que debe sortear el protagonista ya que están diseñados para que este los supere fácilmente o ya de plano como en la batalla final no tenga que hacer absolutamente nada para salir triunfante."
884,885,1,"I wasn't expecting to be thrilled, but I certainly wasn't expecting to be so thoroughly disappointed. I won't stop my kids from reading this nonsense, but I certainly won't encourage it either. Just plain silly and repetitious.
15 Jan 2010 - Whilst reading 'Borges the Poet' by Carolos Cortinez. Page 190 - The author states Borges shared Quevedo's hatred of ""empty mythology, poetic untruth and coiners of false art who force upon us their rusty mythological figures"". Also discussed the timeless problem: the relative importance of what one says and how one says it; substance and form, the idea and its verbal expression... literature is more than technique..."""
885,886,1,"Reads like a TV series, for those with VERY short attention spans. (Can't hold a candle to the Wardrobe series!) Each chapter takes about 15 min. and there is no discernable plot, with each chapter being just another bedtime story wherein one can only half-heartedly wonder what might happen to Harry next. Very disappointing as I loved the idea of a child wizard in this day and age. Movies are way, way better, at least the first couple and the last couple. (Still would love to have a Quidditch ball cap!) In the middle releases, the movies got a bit too dark for us, not only philosophically but visually. Didn't read the rest of the books because the first one was so bad."
886,887,1,"I don't understand what the big deal about Harry Potter is. I don't find it even remotely interesting. I think there is too much going on, with the different ""houses"" and all of that. I remember watching the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and thinking how good it was, so I decided to read the series from the beginning to get a better understanding of the movie. But I didn't. I barely finished the first book, and that took me over at least 4 months. I couldn't just abandon it, because I wanted to feeling that I finished it. Most of my friends are fans of Harry Potter, but I don't understand why he's so great."
887,888,1,"I have never been a fan of Harry Potter, and never seen the fascination. Reading this book I could never get into it, and struggled finishing the book. I have never really enjoyed the fantasy genre. To my Harry Potter is to unrealistic, I was not a fan of all the wizards, magic, or make believe characters. For me I like to read about some I can picture happening to me, Harry Potter didn’t do that for me. I tried to give it a chance because it has been the hype it has gotten, but I still could not get into the book. However, many people to really enjoy the book so I would recommend anyone who has not read the book, and enjoys fantasy to read Harry Potter"
888,889,1,"I know this is a beloved novel, but I found it boring. These characters simply didn't work for me. After a number of times trying to finish this book over many years, I remain too uninterested in the main character to care enough to try to care. I wanted to like it, but it simply didn't touch me in any way but to put me to sleep. When I want to read a good children's fantasy, I have some great ones on my shelves that have stood the test of time and many re-readings, and where the characters continue to live in my imagination. It may be that I was simply too old when this book came out and the magic of Harry's world was forever lost to me."
889,890,1,"Pros:

Interesting reading.

Cons:

False depiction of witch-craft. Witch-craft is not a clean, rare and powerful skill that only some are able to wield. This is how Almighty God felt about it: Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. (Exodus 22:18) And also: Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are: Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. (Galatians 5:19-21)"
890,891,1,"One of the very few books I couldn't complete. I've been accused by almost everyone I've ever met of being weird, or overly imaginative, or somehow outside normal in a particular kind of way that is neither particularly good nor bad - and I felt that all drawing away from me, and being replaced by a washed-out gray while reading the first few pages of this book. It tried to change me, Harry Potter tried to destroy some essential component of my ability to draw connections between different things - it attempted to destroy the generative power to make analogy, or poetry - but it failed.

If I have children, I hope they do not waste their time with this inferior doggerel."
891,892,1,"This book was definitely comic relief. However, after hearing everyone raving about it, my expectations were not met. While readers of all ages love this series, it did not have enough action in it for me."
892,893,1,
893,894,1,"I have never enjoyed fantasy books. Mainly because my best friend loaned me two and I hated them, so I simply never picked up another fantasy book since. But I have been in a mood for more fantasy books- dystopian too. I did not expect to like Harry Potter as much as I did. I’d have to say that it is now my new favorite book of all time. I can’t wait to read the second one.

UPDATE: I have not read any of the other books in the series and do not plan on it. I am no longer interested in Harry Potter and am very disappointed in JK Rowling as a whole. Since i am a part of the lgbtqia+ community i personally cannot support JK in any way."
894,895,1,"Okay, so I love like almost all the books I read. And I read A LOT. I’m not one to leave nasty reviews, but this books is poorly written! It was like a child wrote and the character development? Not there. There’s a everyday poor son, Ron, a snobby know-it-all Herimonie (sorry if I butchered her name spelling-wise), and Harry an orphan that lives with abusive family members. Why? You could make up such more interesting plot, but it’s like such a normal thing to write about. It may just be me, but this book is just an overused plot with some mild twists. Some good quotes, but nothing else. I don’t get the hype and I am very disappointed."
895,896,1,
896,897,1,"I read this in French, with a copy of the English edition at hand. To be honest, I couldn't ever quite get my head around why so much of the book was changed. Poudlard instead of hogwarts? What! Why change that?

However I did learn some invaluable French, such as hibou which is a snowy owl, sorcier which is a witch and baton magic, which is a magic wand, to be honest every conversation in modern France should involve at least one of these phrases, proving to the locals that you are well and truely insane!"
897,898,1,"Oh no! I am going to do the unthinkable, I tried to think this is fun keep going, this is going to make me happy, Hell no, couldnt go beyong 100 pages. I hate this guy Potter, I hate these books, I hate the movies. So with TV I change the channel, with the book I avoid opening them, with the one I own (this one) I am afraid The Big, 'obvious not secretive fans' will crush me in a dancing stamped if they find that I throw mine out and that half of it is clean not touched, not read. Never to read is a reminder to my self when it comes to Harry Potter."
898,899,1,"I would never allow my children to read any of the HP books. I cannot see any of them as being anything but destructive to child/adult, child/child and child/teacher relationships.
""Magic thinking"" is also destructive to a person trying to figure out how to deal with other of life's problems. Instead of determining what to do to solve a problem, these books teach the readers to fantasize about casting a ""spell"", or ""shape changing"" and any number of things that are non-productive to life in the real world."
899,900,1,"We all know who Harry Potter is, Unless you live under a rock! no review needed, we have all seen the movie. Good novel but goes to slow for me, by the time the climax starts, im already bored of the book. For the first time in ever, i like the movie better than the book. Because it goes by as more interesting to me and I really do enjoy the comedy the movie throws in and the characters personalities fit in just right! could not have picked better actors for the job to play Hermoine, Harry, and Ron. Job well done!"
900,901,1,"If you Have the intellect of a 5th grader, then this is for you. If you go to Barnes and Nobel for the release party dressed up, then you are either 5, or you are mentally unstable. You probably kill small animals, and have a strong possibility to live in your mothers basement for the rest of your life. Enjoy that unkept muff on your face, and that long greasy once washed ponytail, while you online chat with strangers, nervously drumming the keyboard with your long dirty fingernails. Enjoy the book!"
901,902,1,"It seems that i am in the minority here, but Harry Potter is definitely not for me. I can usually get through a book this size in a few days, this took me three weeks, with two books in between. Its was just so boring, and seemed totally plotless, i mean what is going on? I found the first 100 pages semi-interesting, but after he gets to Hogwarts, it just got brutal. Its like chapter after chapter of mini-adventure after mini-adventure, there's nothing actually happening.

Anyways, try it if you must, but I could care less what happens past this book."
902,903,1,"Although I rather enjoyed the movies, I just could not get into the series. I got a little over half way through this one and felt like all I was doing was watching the movie. I had been told by my brother to start with the fourth book instead, but when I read a series I like to start from the beginning, and I couldn't get past this one. I am sure I would like some of the other books, but if I cannot get passed this one then there is no reason to continue and I refuse to jump into the middle."
903,904,1,Harry Potter was one of those books where you kinda liked it but mostly hated it. In the novel Harry thinks he is just a regular kid but then finds out he is a wizard. He then goes to the wizard school and meets two friends. Ron and HErmaiane. They go on adventures and misbehave together but at the end of the book HArry saves the stone by defeating voldemort... The man who killed his parents and gave him the scar on his forhead. I would not recommend this book because i didn't really pay attention because I didn't like it.
904,905,1,"edit// Rowling's an awful transphobe and I can't bring myself to have her works on my account with 5 star ratings, so down they go.

Ah, the nostalgia. I power-read my way through this in one day, though I must have read it, at least, twenty times before, if not more. It's always nice to go back into a series you haven't touched in a bit. Harry Potter is just as magical this time around as it was the first time.

There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said, so I'll leave it at that."
905,906,1,"3.9/5 stars

(Yes. I had not read Harry Potter until now. Don't for shame me.)
I never expected this to be so funny!!!! And emotional!!! I laughed and cried, and although I didn't love the characters as much as I thought I would (so many expectations I guess), I did love them. Mostly Hagrid and McGonagall :D
RON IS SO FUNNY. THAT BIT WITH HERMIONE AND MAKING FIRE OMFG I LAUGHED SO MUCH I CRIED :'D
Hagrid and Harry's friendship is the best thing ever!!
I hate Snape.

Looking forward to reading the rest of this series :)"
906,907,1,"disclaimer: i fucking hate jk rowling i dont understand why she decided to die on her terf hill. trans lives matter, trans women are women. we dont fucking claim her.
i decided to reread this after like 10 years bc i loved the witch, please podcast and felt it was time to revisit the books with a critical mind and i am sad to report that i was still pulled in to the magic of this world. i am a firm believer that you cant separate art from the artist and in fact, it is impossible in this instance as the hp series is full of antisemitism, racism and much more."
907,908,1,"I have to say that I am disappointed in this book. I am a young teen with a love of fantasy and magic, and this book has so many fans. But when I finally sat down to read it after countless friends' encouraging, I found that it was not that great a book. The characters were flat and had little character, and the plot twists were so predictable. Harry Potter, the protagonist, is overly powerful, with no weaknesses other than being bad at chess. I don't really understand what people love about this series."
908,909,1,"Learn how to worldbuild. The whole harry potter plot had a lot of potential, but you didn't worldbuild as much as you should have. Everything revolves around hogwarts and the ministry of magic. You don't explain where magic comes from or the limits of it. Hogwarts doesn't teach any subjects school should like biology or maths, instead the school teaches potions and charms. Also the only southeast Asian character is called Cho Chang??? Nah, I dislike this whole series because the worldbuilding sucks, the lack of diversity as well as J.k being a horrible human being"
909,910,1,"This book, I really don't like it. It's so long and every book the ending's the same: something bad happens with Voldemort and Harry Potters fights him or whatever.
Can't there be more interesting endings? The book's so long and the plot's so boring and I really just hate this book. So I don't suggest this book. And why do all the evil guys have to be in Slytherin? A plot twist maybe could be like Harry Potter's supposed to be in Slytherin even though he's a good guy. The plot's just too boring and the books are all basically the same. This book is not worth spending my time reading it."
910,911,1,"I'm glad a fantasy series came along and became the biggest publishing phenomenon of my lifetime. I'm not so glad that it was this one. I finally read this one after much prodding, and I was not impressed. Please stop telling me that I have to read to book [three/five/four/seven] to like it. ""Really, you only have to endure about three books of pain, then it starts getting where you actually don't hate yourself anymore!"" Okay. I'll be over here reading something else."
911,912,1,"I thought this was supposed to be a book about wizards. Sure, people carry wands, but -- spoiler alert -- the author hardly even described any pointy hats. How can you tell the difference between the wizards and the humans if the wizards don't wear pointy hats? I found it to be confusing. Lots of characters without ever just saying ""Hermione Granger, a wizard"" or ""Vernon Dursley, not a wizard."" Cormac McCarthy would have crushed this plot. 1.893 stars out of 5"
912,913,1,"i love that she made money and we have a woman writer as an icon, that's great! what a wonderful rags-to-riches tale. her life, not the silly books.

remember, i may not like the books, but i love harry potter jokes :) for those countless joys, i thank her!

srsly though if any more brits complain about the holocaust..oh wait THEY call it wwII, no one put them in concentration camps. just like j tolkein (sp?) and his rings kvetching. sigh"
913,914,1,"This trendy book became popular when I was serving my mission in Russia. I returned to America amidst the Potter craze. I was hesitant and slow to delve into these books. However, my curiosity was piqued and I soon delved in. It was a disappointment and a bore for me. I found the movies to be even worse! I lasted through the first movie, then the second, but never got beyond that. As for the books, I never even tried to start any others, I had had it with Harry Potter."
914,915,1,
915,916,1,"In this book Harry go's to a wizard school and when he was little his parents died and he had to live with his aunt and uncle and his cousin and they always treated him bad and the aunt and the uncle made him sleep in a small closet and then one day a school sended him a letter to come and then when he went to a musuem and some how he pushed his cousin without using his arm's.

Then this wizard teacher comes and get Harry go's with him then Harry meets new friends and learns new majaic"
916,917,1,"Fantasy has never been my thing. I slogged through this in high school, wondering why a book written at a third grade level was such a big hit. Everyone tells me the writing style grows up as Harry grows up, but I don't want to wait until book 4 for it to ""get good"" when there are other books to read. I realize this is an unpopular opinion. Please don't fillet me alive.

I'll just go ahead and apparate now."
917,918,1,"I tried, really I did.
My God this was awful. No redeeming features. I can only imagine its popularity is owed to some sort of ""Emperors new clothes"" deal.
Normally rational, intelligent people I know claim to have enjoyed this rubbish.
It took me four attempts to read this, so awful and poorly written that I had to force my way through it.
If you waste your time on this, more fool you.
Without doubt the single worse book I have ever suffered to read.
Avoid like the plague."
918,919,1,"So I read this book in 2009 and I really really disliked it. I don't like any type of book that has to do with wizards, magic, and just unrealistic stuff. Lots of people say J.K Rowling is the richest childrens' author, which I don't really understand. For one it was just out right boring and repetitive. I'm not going to even bother reading any of the others because I absolutely know they are going to just as bad.

p.s- Don't take this the wrong way J.K Rowling fans!"
919,920,1,"Update: I downgraded this book to one star and removed it from most of my shelves due to the horrifyingly transphobic and generally awful comments made by the author in the past several years, which have revealed her truly bigoted point of view. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend the works of an author with whom I so thoroughly disagree and whom I find so morally repugnant, especially when those works have been written expressly for young people."
920,921,1,"I'm going through my list and changing everything to 1 star. Given JK's views and how large her platform is, I feel giving her any positive feedback just gives her more power to hurt innocent people.

It's not much but I want to make my feelings clear and those feels are that she's betrayed an entire generation by her bigotry and hateful words and actions.

Transpeople are people.

TERFS Ain't Got No Friends."
921,922,1,"Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone is the first novel of the Harry Potter series. This series is one of my favorite series and this is a very good book. What is great about these books is the high level of writing and great story line. I would recommend this book to young adults. Lastly, I think the author wrote it to entertain. A Phoenix symbolizes rebirth which means that Harry or Voldemort could be hard to kill."
922,923,1,"I read this book when I was some 20 years old and desperate for a distraction from the monotony of having a flu under a pine tree, far from any form of civilisation. It must have been the fever that prevented me from appreciating the story or the characters so beloved by so many, but I found it boring, predictable and uninspiring. Also very short, so in consequence, after only a couple of hours, I found myself again book-less and more wretched than before. Some things are unpardonable. ;)"
923,924,1,"Orphan Harry Potter is miserable in an under-stairs closet. Dursleys - his witch mother's sister, husband, Dudley - held no birthday party for Harry in 11 years. Owls fly notices to attend Hogwarts School. Giant Hagrid brings birthday cake. Wizard Harry flies on broom, hides under Cloak of Invisibility, sneaks past 3-headed dog with friends Hermione and Ron. A great destiny awaits if Harry can survive."
924,925,1,"I don't want to make a huge review because everything to be said about Harry Potter has already been said. I'm a total Potterhead, and always will be. As for this book in particular, I'm extremely fond of it because it's the beginning of a huge adventure that will live in our hearts forever. The story and vocabulary ate superb, and personally JKR is my idol. Her style is perfect, as is this series."
925,926,1,"It was a fast read, very short. I couldn't get into Rowling's writing that much, Harry was such a Mary Sue-ish character. I've grown up without Harry Potter, and when I finally got around to reading it, I was SO disappointed. I had such high expectation, thinking, ""This is it, the book they claimed to be the best"", but it wasn't. For me personally, people overhype this book so much and it really doesn't deserve the hype it receives."
926,927,1,"These books were entertaining enough, although they never quite lived up to the hype. Now that the author of children's books has decided to use her success to become the worldwide spokesperson for a very specific type of bigotry, it would be impossible for me to ever enjoy a single page of Harry Potter again, so I'm dropping my ratings. There is already enough hatred in this world, and teaching children to hate is a special kind of evil."
927,928,1,"Spectacular!!

I love the Harry Potter movies and expected no less from them books. I just love reading the parts that they have left out in the movies, and the best part is, there were not that many!! The book is so entertaining and has great word choice and helps
me further imagine Hogwarts for myself- I loved the book. I also think the books are funnier and I enjoyed laughing at some parts of this. I'm extremely excited to read the rest of the series."
928,929,1,"1/15-2-20,The theme of the novel is basically harry being raised by his aunt and uncle who are mean to him but then he starts a new beginning by going to a wizard school, “ might as well get yer uniform” the reason this quote is significant is because this is where harry gets all of his supplies to go to the wizard school, Yes I would recommend it but I would recommend it to upper classmen such as juniors and seniors."
929,930,1,"Acho escrito de uma forma preguiçosa e clichê, a mesma história sobre um órfão triste que descobre que ele é o escolhido (além de rico, famoso, bom nos esportes, adorado por todos, cheio de plot-armor, corajoso, com uma capa de invisibilidade) que já vimos mil vezes. Parece um chat de internet, em que quando alguém grita eles escrevem em maiúsculas, terminando cada diálogo ""disse a pessoa x, dessa forma"". Muito fraco."
930,931,1,"Didn't read this series as a kid, and started it later. It was already hugely popular, and I saw some of the movies and knew a lot about the plot. I liked the story and the setting, but hated the writing, so I couldn't get into it. Despite how others raved about the rest of the series, I disliked this one so much paused on reading the rest of the series for a while. My least favorite out of all the Harry Potter books."
931,932,1,"really interested in it as soon as I picked it up.

my dad read it,i heard about it because people in my class were talking about it,then I started reading it,stopped at book #5,reread until the 5th a few times because i felt the 5th was more boring than the others.finally, I pushed through once and read the 5th-7th books.
A year/so ago, my dad finished reading the entire series to the whole family,including my siblings and I."
932,933,1,"YA Fiction, Fantasy, Magic

yeah I thought this whole series was boring and over rated (i didn’t make it all the through) also it’s full of racism and antisemitism. And JK Rowling sucks so much. Fuck terfs!!! I think i read this in 4th or 5th grade.
-August 2022"
933,934,1,"Meu primeiro e último livro da série Harry Potter. Admiro o trabalho de JK Rowling assim como admiro o de Paulo Coelho. São escritores que estão estimulando as pessoas, especialmente jovens e crianças, a ler mais. E só. É entretenimento de primeira e, assim espero, o pontapé inicial para leituras mais substanciais."
934,935,1,"What I loved about this series was finally a fantasy series with a diverse bunch of nornal-looking students. I felt like maybe I could have been among them. But now that the author's views are made clear I know I could never exist in this world because it's only for white, straight, binary folks and that just isn't where I can exist and isn't where I want to be."
935,936,1,This book wasn't a very good book in my eyes. The book was about a kid named Harry and his parents were both killed in a car crash his uncle and aunt told him. Until one day when a man named hagrid showed up and told him his parnts were killed by a sorcer namd Voldemort. he meet s many freind and goes on many adventers. I don't think it was the greatest book though.
936,937,1,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the name of this book throughout the English speaking world except America. The name was changed, because Americans are too ""ignorant"" to know what the Philosopher's Stone is. I just wanted to let people know what this most fantastic artist of literature thinks about you. Also the book is a sub par literary work of pseudo-fantasy."
937,938,1,"I have been a fan of science-fiction and fantasy for many years and I was disappointed when I finally read this book after all of the hype and fanfare. It is certainly well written and the setting is well-crafted, but I found it to be lacking. My impression was of a fantasy series written for people who don't really like fantasy."
938,939,1,"J.K. Rowling's first atempt at writting, in my opinion, didn't merit the wild sucess that it recived. I thought it was terrible. But hey, unlike many first time writes who do succeed, she got better. And better. And even better still with each book she wrote. She has even gotten so good that an insufferable snob like me is waiting with baited breath to see whast she does next."
939,940,1,"Ugh. Two chapters in and I wanted to hunt down Rowling and make her swear she'd never write again. The whole escape to magic-land was a cheap vehicle to harness pre-teen angst and profit from it. It probably worked great as a bedtime story told to her kid, but as an actual novel, it's not that novel."
940,941,1,"Don't get me wrong; almost anything that gets children reading is worthy of respect. I just couldn't break through the bubble of reality and fall into the narrative. Had I been ten years old or so, this most likely would have been read and reread until the book was in tatters. I was just a bit too old to catch this train."
941,942,1,"Meh, I've never been a huge fantasy fan. This book was nothing special. I hear so much about these Harry Potter books and have seen a couple movies, but never actually read a book. It just seemed dull to me and too far fetched to me. The actual writing in the book was good, JK Rowling is an excellent writter, but I'm personally just not a big fan of her writing style."
942,943,1,"I am not a Harry Potter book fan. I enjoyed the two movies I saw but lost interest in the series as a whole ages ago. Something about her writing style, really irked me. I can't imagine the millions who've read 1,000 pages of this dribble and gotten 'harry potter headaches' and the whole nine. I'm secretly glad/proud not to be one of them though :)"
943,944,1,"Eu devo ser a única pessoa que não ficou encantada pelo Harry Potter, mas é a verdade, não gostei minimamente... Já me disseram que os outros livros são mais interessantes e dinâmicos... mas este achei tão chato, aquela história toda a explicar as escolas e tal e tal... Talvez o meu espírito não estivesse muito virado para apreciar tal livro, mas nunca tive vontade de ler mais nenhum da colecção."
944,945,1,"I’ve edited my ratings of the Harry Potter books/series because of the reprehensible remarks and behaviors of JK Rowling. I used to read the entire series at least once a year, but now, I can’t bring myself to read them at all. I’m glad that the cast of the movies stood against her, as I’m able to watch those without getting angry."
945,946,1,I do not know why but I never really liked the books or the movie. I found the first book not that good and I had no interest of going on. It did not really make sense to me but I also am into mysteries and action books so that might also be the reason. It was not horrible but I did not find it that good.
946,947,1,"I read this back in third grade, before the first movie had come out, and I just couldn't jump onto the bandwagon. I didn't like it. It's as simple as that.

I've tried rereading it, because both my sisters love the series, but I can't get past the first chapter. Sorry, I guess it just isn't my cup of tea. I haven't even watched all the movies, either."
947,948,1,Also my hard stance on Harry Potter right now is that JK Rowling has done so much bad on a societal level that it completely negates any value her books might have had. There are other authors and if you value trans lives at all it is your responsibility to seek those books out. Vile and disgusting.
948,949,1,"I think that this book was extremely boring! it was so hard to get through the first 10 pages let alone the first chapter or even the whole book.

I personally don't agree with everyone else i think harry potter is a terrible book. If you want a magical adventure your better off watching the movie, i also recommend 'The Magic Thief' or 'The Dragon of Trelian'."
949,950,1,"Okay.
So.
I gave it a go, and lets say i'm not going to continue on reading the rest. I dont know, I wasnt really feeling it, maybe because I enjoy reading mature young adult books, this seems rather creative in thought in all, but not the book for me. I actually like the movies but I guess its not the same for the book."
950,951,1,"I know everyone loves this cuddly little story line... but I abhor it from the depths of my dark heart. Randomly conjuring events out of thin air without coherence or interconnectedness is not my flavor of creativity. I know everyone loves it, and wants to give Rowling a great big hug, and that's cool. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. Nuff said :)"
951,952,1,"J.K. Rowling has managed to make millions off of this book by copying other masterpieces, failing to interpret her idea, bore my to death, and step on my soul. There are hundreds of brilliant novelists out there, and it is a shame a cheesy, poorly executed excuse for a book is what teens are reading."
952,953,1,"My best memory associated with this book is when a 8 year old boy passing by, seeing me reading it while seated at Mc Donald's, gave me a smile and a wave of recognition.

Other than that, even by children books standards I found it rather mediocre. I'm told it gets better later in the series ; I'm not sure I'm gonna check this (life is short)"
953,954,1,"Das Abendteuer meiner Kindheit und Jugend beginnt erneut...

Ich habe diese Buch in meiner Kindheit unzählige Male gelesen und bis heute hält mich der Zauber fest in seiner Hand.
Dieses Buch hat mir sogar das Lesen beigebracht.

Die Welt und die Tiefe die hinter dieser gesamten Reihe steckt ist ein ganz besonderes Erlebnis für Jung und Alt."
954,955,1,"I gave this book one star because it was SO slow! Like super slow! Did I mention that it was slow? other then that it is a tip-top book to read. All the other books ROCK, but you have to read the first book to understand. Sorry:(
(but not if you watch the MOVIE! BAM! :P)
I would give these book a 8 and up age to read because it is in english? :}
(I like smiles)"
955,956,1,"My first thought when beginning to read the Sorcerer's Stone was ""This is quite different from the movie"" and my second thought, maybe a handful of pages in was ""Damn! I'm late to the party!"".
My 20 year old self didn't find the book very amusing or world-view-altering but I have a very strong feeling that my 12-ish year old self would have adored this book from page one."
956,957,1,"2016: Reread with Ellie


2019: Apparently I finished this on October 10, 2016. It’s now October 8, 2019, and I just finished a reread. I love me and I love the universe and this matrix we are living in. Also obviously I love Harry Potter but who TF is reading reviews on goodreads for HP. YES. READ IT."
957,958,1,"I read this book (and the rest of the series) for the first time as a freshman in highschool and let me just tell you, it was amazing. I don't understand how I hadn't read it before then. J.K. Rowling really knows her stuff. She's a brilliant writer. This is now one of my favorite series, if not my overall favorite."
958,959,1,"Me faltaron 30 paginas... pero siento que ya no puedo seguir. Me aburrió demasiado y eso que esperaba con muchas ganas volver a leerlo.

Pretendía releer la saga completa, pero luego de esto tengo mucho miedo de intentarlo. No le pongo estrellitas porque creo que sería injusto tomando en cuenta que ni siquiera lo terminé."
959,960,1,"E' semplicemente orrendo. Per fortuna la mia fida libraia mi disse di cominciare dal secondo volume, altrimenti non avrei mai scoperto quanto mi piace Harry Potter.
Ed è un suggerimento che tra l'altro sento dare da tutti...su Rowling, ti lasciamo il beneficio di pensare che il primo fosse solo una prova..."
960,961,1,"Honestly, really predictable. Harry potter gets in trouble, Harry isn't expelled like he should be but is instead in some ways rewarded. It was honestly boring. Only reading series to see what big fuss is about. I understand that the first books are ment for young children so they can grow with Harry. Seriously hoping these books pick up and get better as we go along!"
961,962,1,"What the heck is wrong with this book? I mean last time I tried to ride a broom I was camping. There was an incident with bees, me running into their nest, and I fell down this large cliff. I STILL have a fire hydrant in my leg! After so long! Don’t fly on your brooms kids, and to any of you 11 year olds, I didn’t get MY Hogfarts letter, so don’t get your hopes up, beucase it’s not happening."
962,963,1,"I thought this was a good first book. It wasn't boring. But if you have already seen the movie, it feels almost line for line and scene. There are only a few, minor differences in the first couple books. I'm reading the series for the first time and since I didnt have a fresh experience with the books I gotta say hats off to the movie on this one."
963,964,1,"What is it going to take for people to stop reading these books and promoting this author who is actively spreading hatred, fear, and encouraging violence??? Yes, I too loved these books once but that love does not trump my love for other human beings. Stop buying these. Stop reading them. This woman needs to be held accountable for the pain she has caused"
964,965,1,"this may be the most over-hyped, overrated book i have ever read in all my life. i had to force myself to binge read because of my completionist tendencies. the writing was also very d-tier for me. her use of colourful dialogue tags is cute, but it got old really fast and was rather laughable in some places. i can’t see why so many people are ride-or-die for this book."
965,966,1,"Horrendously written, and horrendously boring. Tried reading this at fourteen and thought it was just bland if anything. This is coming from a woman whose favorite book was Carrie by Stephen King at the time.
I’d still reread that book 100 times front to back instead of reading a sentence of this trash. Glad it got other kids into reading but that’s about it."
966,967,1,Okay so I really hated this book. Disclaimer I watched the movies and loved them. But when I read this book it was so dry and I was not interested. However I forced myself to finish it. I already knew most of the stuff that was gonna happen. Barely different from the movie sorry if you disagree but I really hated this read.
967,968,1,"i fucking hate this goddamn awful series. not just cause it’s been shoved down my throat my whole life or cause it’s the societal norm to be obsessed with it but just cause it’s absolutely terrible. like nothing to sugar coat. it’s bland, boring and a complete rip off of lord of the rings CAN WE PLEASE STOP PRETENDING IT’S GOOD 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
968,969,1,"Entorno muy chulo, historia nula. ""Harry Potter se presenta en sociedad: éste es el profe tal, éste es el profe cual, éste es el niño listo, éste no…""

Aparte está el giro cutre del final para aparentar que había una trama detrás del bodrio."
969,970,1,I read this book when I was working in the children's section of the library and wanted to understand the big deal. I have reread them all several times and while as not as good writing as some of the older classics such as the ones written by Baum or Lewis but still a fun read.
970,971,1,"I couldn't get past the first book. Found it un-original, predictable, and poorly written. And the tamest vision of magic I have ever read. This is a video game version of magic. Not the sorcery I know and love."
971,972,1,I was forced to read all the Harry books because I guessed the ending of the books based on fantasy lit and what my wife told me about the books she was reading. I hated this book and still do. Rowling definately improved her writing a lot through the first 4 books.
972,973,1,"Can't stand a book that seems to rip off ideas from c.s.lewis, lord of the rings, star wars,etc. Chapters seem disjointed and written in such a way that don't move the story along, and the finale comes out of thin air. But that's just me. Kids and teens and fantasy buff seem to really like it."
973,974,1,"I'm glad I stuck with the series, BUT: I can't believe this tripe secured JKR a seven-book deal. It's one of the worst things I've ever read, or more accurately floated above on a cloud of shock and loathing."
974,975,1,Purchased on the interest of media hype. Duped again. Would be great for young kids in getting them at least interested in the general idea of reading but after that you should make the little fuckers read Kafka.
975,976,1,"Okay, I admit it--I'm one of the three people in the world who don't like Harry Potter. My daughter will probably disown me, but I don't understand all the hoopla surrounding these books. They're just books!!"
976,977,1,I did not like this book. After my wife's urging I finally read it for the sole purpose of getting to the later books (books 3 and above) that actually have decent writing. In the end it was worth it because the last few books were amazing.
977,978,1,I couldn't do it... I wish that I would've read them before I saw all of the movies. I just hate knowing what is going to happen and having everything already pictured in my head for me from the movies
978,979,1,"Some people are in love with Harry Potter. I'm not one of those people. I honestly was not interesed, i've justed waited and watched the movies. And i can say one thing from that, its worked out pretty good..."
979,980,1,"I really don't like the Harry Potter series. The stories are O.K. The plots are O.K. But I think that people say that it is much better then it is.

I think that the Harry Potter series is really over-rated and not as good as people say that it is."
980,981,1,"Alright, I realize that some of you may feel that I need to have my ability to read withdraw from my frontal lob, but after years of trying, I cannot get into fantasy. It is just not my cup of tea, but I salute all of you who enjoy it and read on!"
981,982,1,"I didn't really understand what all the hype was about this book. Maybe it's a cultural thing. I think people who like movies about English private (""public"") school will like this. It's kinda a turn off when I meet guys who like Harry Potter."
982,983,1,"encouraging kids to lie to grown ups isn't a good idea, no matter what arena or cause. just another story where the adults are made to look either evil or stupid or both. ugh. finished the book, left just past half time in the movie theatre. a waste of a good tree."
983,984,1,In this book Harry learns that he is a wizard and so were his parents. He goes to a school of magic called Hogwarts. He is well known in this hidden world. He is known as the kid who has met Volemort and lived. He then becomes a hero who gets the sorcerer's stone from one of his professors.
984,985,1,"While I enjoyed reading these books I received a whole new perspective on them when my 9 year old read them. I was not impressed when my daughter started quoting things from the book to her little brother like ""I will get revenge."""
985,986,1,"Cards on the table: I could never get into these books. I leafed through the first few, but they just didn't hold my attention. What initially struck me as fluffy now seems like self-indulgent mumbo-jumbo...but clearly I'm not the target audience."
986,987,1,"I was just at a remote cabin in La Push, with grandsons 6 and 8. Many days were cold and foggy, and soon the most dreaded words I could hear were, ""Read Harry Potter."" Even they got tired of that snoozefest."
987,988,1,I read this long ago when it was first released to the public. I tried reading through it but there was a lack of development that I didn't like. I have not and will not read the remaining six. Are they as dark and dreary as the films tho?? Not really a YA film if you ask me
988,989,1,i really don't understand what is so great or inspiring about the harry potter series. the language and characters are trite. there are many more magical books out there that blow the soles off the harry potter series. i am truly mystified...
989,990,1,"Okay, so I enjoyed the book... color me shocked. It's a nice morality tale with a bit (like the tiniest hint of a class-analysis involved) and can appeal to anyone who is singled out for being different.

Now onto Book 2."
990,991,1,I'm sorry Harry Pottr fans! I didn't like it...it's defnately not something I like. I'm not a big fan of fantasy at all unless it's ghosts... or romantic. I'm not into magic magic as in spells and curses. It just didn't suit me at all. It was also not that interesting to me.
991,992,1,Read Harry Potter as a child and loved it. Not diehard or obsessive but I was a fan. Now it is what it is. Now I avoid anything Harry Potter to keep its author from profiting more. Rowling is transphobic. I can't support her in any way.
992,993,1,"I honestly can't recommend that anyone purchase this book. I grew up on Harry Potter, and I loved the books and the universe, but the author being a complete asswipe has sadly ruined my experience of this story completely. I feel embarrassed to own these books."
993,994,1,"I never actually finished this- sorry to disagree with billions of people but I hated this book! Too many characters, too much wackiness- long winded sentences! Glad it got kids passionate about reading but seriously not my cup of tea. At all."
994,995,1,"Execrable, poor writing, a mish-mash of Dickens, Lewis and who knows what else. I made it about half-way through, really expecting something at least passable. The one star is because I liked the owls."
995,996,1,"It is dreadfully disappointing that an author who is able to imagine such a magical world as Harry Potter's imagines that world being as fatphobic, racist, antisemitic, and transphobic as the one we live in."
996,997,1,"I don't know what all the fuss was about with this book. I loved the movie, but the book was written so poorly, it took me ages to finish because all I wanted to do was put it down and read something else."
997,998,1,"I don't want any hate, but I honestly don't like the book. Yes, I'm 12, and I should like it, but I don't. Sorry. I didn't get into the book as I did other books. I read advanced books. I like to read adult. Not a kids story. I'm sorry if I hurt any feelings."
998,999,1,"I honestly didn't like the book at all because it made no sense to me but I understand those who like it, it is a popular series, I am not a hater BUT I did not enjoy this book... I don't recommend this book but those who want to try it out... go for it!"
999,1000,1,I don't really like the Harry Potter books because i'm just not interested in fantasy books like this Harry Potters books. But this book will be for middle schoolers because it will be at their reading level and might be interesting for them to read whoever likes fantasy books.
1000,1001,1,"We're going to get in trouble for this, but while yes... Harry Potter is a fun read, well, shhhh, we just uh-oh, here we go... only gave it one star.

(Thought we could hide our review in a French version... we read it in English...)"
1001,1002,1,"I don't read a lot of teen literature, but I picked this one up to see if my son would be interested in it. I made two attempts to start this book and just couldn't get into it. I did not recommend this book to my son."
1002,1003,1,"Looking back book is problemic in ways I didn't catch in highschool, not a huge surprise. But if the author wasn't a giant shithead I wouldn't have had cause to reevaluate my opinion on this book. So I guess thanks for that JKR."
1003,1004,1,"Finally managed to get round to buying and wished that I hadn't.

Cliched writing and characters that come across as a tired updating of The Worst Witch. Amazed that this every became as popular as it did!"
1004,1005,1,"CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THIS SERIES IS APPARENTLY SO GOOD? (I'm being dead serious)

I'm sorry that I don't find teenagers who have wizerd powers to be interesting enough to make a book series out it."
1005,1006,1,I thoroughly disliked this novel. I felt as though I was cheated out of this amazing story everyone buzzed about. It was a waste of my time and should have just stuck to the movies (which I did enjoy)
1006,1007,1,
1007,1008,1,"'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' meets 'The Faraway Tree'. Completely derivative and unoriginal, JK Rowling matches her plagiarism with an equal measure of tepid uninspired writing.
If you're over 14 years old, you should be ashamed if you like this book."
1008,1009,1,"Forgive me, just being arch. Who doesn't love Harry? And actually I admire J.K. Rowlings so much. She is a decent, generous person and deserve every word of praise she gets. And she doesn't really need five stars from me, heaven forbid..."
1009,1010,1,"Only read the first Harry potter (years ago) then gave up on the series. I really do not know what all the fuss is about. Unoriginal and bland, there was nothing in there that grabbed me.
Don't know how this made the author so rich - Terry Pratchett must be pissed right off!"
1010,1011,1,"I understand it has a large following and that the author obviously put lots of time and effort into the series, but it just didn't get me. Maybe I should try it again another time. Maybe. Actually maybe never."
1011,1012,1,"i didnt really liked it cuz im not a harry potter fan book guy, i like the movies better , i didnt read the last 12 pages becouse the book didnt catch my interest at all, but the movie is ok, just not a harry potter reader."
1012,1013,1,"I'd rate this book less than one star if I could, not saying it's the worst book ever I'm not trying to offend any one but this book didn't quite reach the standards I'm used to. I could barely make it through the first chapter."
1013,1014,1,"First of all, eff these books. Harry Potter has BARELY any romance, and JESUS CHRIST, it is as boring as HELL! Why the hell did they make so much money!!? EFF, EFF, EFFFFF!
(sorry all HP lovers...pls don't hate me?)"
1014,1015,1,"liked the movies....HATED THE BOOKS! these books are just awful, i tried reading them but i just got bored, i like magic and fantasy and fiction. But J.K. Rowlings writing style is just very boring in my OPINION..please dont murder me in comments by this review"
1015,1016,1,I didn't really think this book was as good as many people said it was instead I thought it was kinda boring and it was just not my type of book I just do not enjoy that type of story line for the books that I read.

As expected, the illustrations brought this book to I legitimately want to buy another copy, solely to take it apart and.

 Honestly, how could you love such beautiful images?


Hogwarts, Hogwarts. Hoggy Hoggy warty warts.

I think at this point, everyone and their great-great-grandmother has heard of this book.

Harry Potter, orphaned before he was one, was sent to live with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. He was always a bit of  - much to his family's dismay.

Things just......around him. Like when he was running from bullies and jumped to the school roof. Or when he got an atrocious haircut (courtesy of Aunt Petunia) and all of his hair grew back in a single night.

On his eleventh birthday, a letter comes to him and  in front of his eyes.

In short - I LOVED THIS ONE. I thought I loved the Harry Potter books when I first read them, but when I bought the illustrated version...well, that love instantly quadrupled.

The fully illustrated Philosopher's Stone still has all the wonder and amazement as the boy-turned-wizard embarks on a harrowing 7-book-adventure and the illustrations bring a whole new dimension.

 Just look at these images - they're magnificent:


Ahh! Just look at sad, tiny Harry. Don't worry kid - life will get better!

Not only are these but there are so  of them.

Often, illustrated books have a picture here or there but not HP. There's  like this - and often the pages without full-sized images will have a small illustrations here and there between the large ones.

Words cannot express how highly I recommend this one. If you haven't read HP recently...I  you to check out this book.

1,2,5,"Update – 4/4/2022 – Reread out loud to my kids

Both of my kids were born after the whole Harry Potter series was released. They are now old enough to start appreciating the story so I thought it would be fun to read it out loud to them. While it did take us a while because, you know . . . life happens . . . we were able to find a few minutes every few nights or so to read a chapter or part of a chapter. It was really fun to see them getting into it.

They are looking forward to watching the movie and starting in on the Chamber of Secrets!

Original review:

One of my first jobs was at a bookstore. When I was a kid my Mom would take me to the mall and I would spend tons of time hanging out at Waldenbooks (who here remembers Waldenbooks?) Right when I became legally old enough to work, I went in and submitted my application and a few weeks later I was selling literature to the masses.

Why do I tell you this story on this review, you ask? Well, at the time, young adult/teen literature consisted mainly of RL Stein, Christopher Pike, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, and a few other classic Newberry Award winners, but certainly we did not have a YA section to the extent you see it today.

Towards the end of my tenure at Waldenbooks - as Oprah's book club was hitting its stride and Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus was in its bazzilionth week on the New York Times best seller list - a book display arrived featuring a buzzy new title about a certain boy wizard. I remember the display at the front of the store, and selling a few copies, but I didn't realize what it would become.

A few years later (early 2000s), I had kinda gotten out of the loop on what was big in books. I had just finished college, which had taken up most of my free reading time. A friend of mine named Bronco (yup, real name, not a nickname, who also was the Best Man at my wedding) had a copy of this book on his coffee table. Holy cow! Here is that same book we were selling at Waldenbooks about 5 years before - what was he doing with it!?

Well, he said it was good, so I borrowed it. I quickly plowed through the first 4 books and then got the pleasure of joining the world in waiting for the release of Order of the Phoenix. And, I noticed when I went to the bookstore, the YA section and selection was not so small anymore. I truly believe it was Harry Potter that opened the door to get more young adults (and even adults, of course) reading and authors interested in writing for that genre."
2,3,5,"I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. *clears throat*
I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.
I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.
It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting.
And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love?

In regards to the ending:

3,4,5,"My original review was a comparison of sorts between Harry Potter and Twilight. However, this is stupid as the two are incomparable. Honestly, its not even worth discussing. Its not just that Twilight doesn't come close, it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works. Its peerless. To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It ""ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport.""

There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.
I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me. Eternal, this is the one that started it all.


A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate:
Go ahed, tell me is better.
Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort,
That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly's
That Edward is cooler than Harry,
and Bella is smarter than Hermione.
Tell me that is more talented than .

Go ahead,
I dare you.

Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over,
are utterly stupid.

Quite frankly-this book is amazing."
4,5,5,"Rereading for the 3rd time for the group read.

Once upon a time, there was a 10th grader named Khanh who didn't get along with people very well. She wasn't an outcast in school, and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school, but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughts.



Lunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating, but to sitting in the library, browsing through books.

(Not to worry, she got her nutrition in 5th period in the form of a giant 6-inch M&M studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids and/or a package of Reese's Pieces. Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)

One day, there were shiny new books on her school library's ""New Releases"" shelf. Harry Potter, books 1 through 3. She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children's novels.

At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid's fantasy novel. She had read the series earlier that year, after all. And it had sex in it. SEX! She didn't really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them. Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.

And that did not include Harry Potter. There is a vast difference in their ages. Khanh was a , dammit.

But the Harry Potter books were new. Brand new. They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader. And Khanh was tempted.

She picked up the first book in the series: .

Well, I did it. I FINALLY read my first Harry Potter book...and in the same year as its 20th anniversary no less.

But better late than never, no?

Annnnd I already ordered the illustrated hardback.
And asked for the full hardcover set for Christmas.

I have a confession to make.

I have never read Harry Potter.



Yes, yes, I know...this is akin to reader sacrilege.

But I just had no interest in these books when they came out. I was too busy reading about men in kilts fucking the milkmaid.

Therefore, my only experience with ""Hermione"" is the SNL skit where Lindsey Lohan shows Harry and that other scarfed dude her ginormous tatas.



Well, what with everyone going ape shit over the newest installment, I figure I should probably find out what all this Hogwart's business is about.

And since my friend's 9 year old demanded that I read his copy, I now have the paperback in my possession.

Hoping to get starting this week..."
12,13,5,"These Are The Stories Before We Had SmartPhones

Many years ago, I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone when it was first published in the US, before the movie, before all of the fame and merchandising opportunities. Initially, when I read it, I devoured it in two days. Now that I am old, well as old as Megan Fox, I wanted to hate on the author but couldn't.

JK Rowling makes writing look easy. Her prose is easy to read out loud, very smooth. Although the world that she has created is magical, it isn't confusing or that difficult to imagine unlike LOTR or Dune. The book is also incredibly fast paced. Many of the fantasy books that I have read have at least 100 pages to warm up. So how does the author make us want to root or cheer for Harry? How do we become invested in him? He is an orphan and an abused orphan at that. On the one hand, this formula definitely works, but isn't it a little over done? JK Rowling also sets up some beautiful scenes like when Harry is receiving his invitation to Hogwarts. How many people actually try that hard? When Ron and Harry discover that Hermione is in danger, they both go to assist her. However, most people these days would go, ""Oh well."" Sorry my INFJ is showing.

There were a few things that I didn't like:
*Why does JK Rowling hate cats? Mr Dursley sees something odd, a cat reading a map. My cats play chess, play the piano, watch TV, and once even typed ""hi"" on my computer. I don't find reading a map to be a bit strange at all. Maybe my house is just brimming with magic and as a muggle I just don't know about it? Mrs. Figg also made Harry look at photographs of all of the cats that she has ever owned. As if that is some sort of punishment!
*How Hermione is treated. When Ron and Harry are in trouble, Ron screams at her, ""Have you gone mad? Are you a witch or not?"" Um Ron, if you treat me like, you can save yourself. At the end of the book, Hermione is never fully rewarded for her portion in saving Ron and Harry, just figuring out the riddle. Even after she was a better person than I.
*Quidditch and chess - not really my thing although this opened up a brilliant line of merchandising for the author.
*Some things didn't make sense to me. Why was there a sip of the potions left? Why exactly was Dudley so popular at school?

Now, I think a trip to Orlando is in order to visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter!

Original Review:

I read this book a couple of years ago and, for some unknown reason, never continued on. It was just as wonderfully magical as I remembered, a breath of fresh air during what is usually a stressful time of year for me. I have yet to find a story that feels so pure and childlike that appeals to such a broad range of people. There’s something for everyone here; whether you are 10 or 100, Hogwarts is a place you can escape to and enjoy hearty adventures that you won’t find elsewhere.

I truly love all of the characters and feel the entire cast is well done, but my personal favorites are the Weasley twins, Hagrid, and Professor McGonnall. While I’ve seen all the movies and know the general storyline, I’m really excited to experience the story “first hand” and see what all was left out from the films. I’m also intrigued to find out more about each house, especially the ones that took a backseat in this story. Not sure if I can say anything that hasn’t been said before, but I loved it!"
14,15,5,"So I read the newest editions of the books that I’m going to collect. I have so many different collections I’ll probably add later. In these new books I actually love the art on all the pages instead of the interactive stuff. I put together a collage of a couple pages

15,16,5,"It's Always Great, Coming back Home..

There's a reason us, the Fans, feel that we're connected, no matter where we from, different culture, ethics, ages..we're all graduated from there..

..Hogwarts.. even like we were in same class,classmates, no matter which edition we read..

..Cause Harry Potter is not just a story..it's a Life..

It's One of the most important novels in modern history, Sorry, it's



Without it, most Book stores & publishers may have the same fate of Video Stores like Blockbuster LLC, which, despite being super popular in the 90s, closed all the stores by 2013, shutting down forever.

Yes, without this Novel, and with the rapid change in technology, the ease of making e-books and reading it in PCs, Smartphones, Tablets..etc, the publishing and trade of new paper books may decrease rapidly.
It'd be limited for religious or educating books, classics, small novels. Even those could be just electronic too, and the Books be just like Good Ol' Video Tapes.


A Dystopia, right? very gloomy idea to the world without This novel,

Well, in the case you think I'm exaggerate..Let's have,

Well, let’s back to early 90s , where TV is in every house, even in every room, Video sets are there too, rental video stores everywhere, satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast packed with channels for kids & teenagers, making them attached more & more into screens, …

Those of this new generation who read are “weirdos"" or ""nerds” to the rest of their peers.
And for those “few who read”, book stores mostly got for them comics and graphic novels, which most of them created early this century.


Classic Novels, they read just for Schools and Classes mostly.
And New Novels that make Best Seller are the ones made, or will be made, into movies for Julia Roberts, Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity, or the ones by Stephen King because ,of course, will be made into movies too.

Even these new novels didn't live up the selling numbers of Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie , also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, no more Hugo in France, in no more like Naguib Mahfouz & the great authors of the 50s to 70s..

No new Big Hit for novels, most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange & mysterious things in the world or in religion, Dream interpretation , cocking books or celebrities rumors.


While in US & UK, Top Selling books mostly the Self Help ones, or those teaching Computers Programming and Web Sites


No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers, There's few Successful Highlights though, like R.L.Stine’s Goosepumbs in 1992 which made a very good success, and translated in many countries including Egypt.


And in Egypt there’s also a very successful project by respectful Publishing house that made “Pocket Novels” for youth, by brilliant Egyptian writers presenting huge variety of novels of many genres, Sci-Fi, Action Thriller, comics, Romance .etc.


There’s also “Reading for All”, project by the first lady “Susan Mubarak”, reprinting a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices.


But all these effort didn't attract “more and more” of new youth readers as intended, it just made more and more books for those few who already reads.
The vast numbers of those who don’t just read will increase if there isn't a BIG new attractive to get them into reading, specially with the more channels, more movies.
But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in , and became a real phenomenon by 1995..

..it’s , The giant Japanese Gaming leap..
Football, Crash, Pepsi man, even the comics heroes also have their games, so why reading Superman, Batman’s comics when you can play them..

So by 1996, with this growing leap in Gaming, also the Computer 3D games getting much improved, Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls.

So do you think it’s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer?

Of course not, it may not even cover it’s publishing cost.

So it was very normal when in this year, 1996, when , a 31 years old lady from England , handed the manuscript of her first novel to 12 publishing houses, all of them rejected it...

A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel, and for children??? Seriously is there still any Child left who still read? it’s 1996, the Era of Playstation and Video Games.

But then, the Modest agreed to publish it , with 2 advises for her, first that she’d get a day job, since it’s a little chance of making money in children's books.
But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman..
So with her name & her grandmother’s ""Kathleen"" come the 2 initial of her pen name..

And in , with 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries, come out in UK, to our World The Greatest..


And Bam!! , everything happened so fast..
Before the end of this year the novel was awarded many important literary awards in the UK.

An American important publisher, Scholastic, won the rights to publish the novel in US, with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of.
Just with small change, 'Philosopher's Stone' to be 'Sorcerer's Stone', as the American publisher feared 'Philosopher's' may not be that attractive to young readers..


In Book Two released in UK , in US, winning more literary prizes. And becoming NO.1 Top Selling Book in UK , US and many other countries which start to publish the translated first book.
And on , The made when Book Three sold in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom.. and more copies when it released late 1999 in US..

With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers, more records had been broken..

The 3 books takeover the Top Spot in all charts of Best Selling Books for weeks & months, and it's even still in hardcover editions.
This conquer of the Top Spots made some literary magazines & newspapers separate the 'Harry Potter books' selling records from the rest of the top selling books, splitting the lists into 'Children Books' and 'Adult Books' sections, under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking.



The Playstation 2 is out there, and even higher leap in Computer Games..

But even with this much of temptations, thousands of children, teens and parents gathered in the Midnight of in UK and US at the same day in front of stores, not in front of Cinemas as usual, not electronic stores as Apple stores , But it was in front of , for The First time in the Book Stores History, to buy a copy of...


And They didn't mind to find out that the book is over 700 page, it was even for their pleasure, more than double the size of any of the first 3 novels.. double the thriller, double the fun..

Over 3 million copies sold at that day only in the US , a New World Record, totally unexpected one.
Huge story, bigger plot , mysterious and very well written.

And more literate prizes for Rowling... more translated editions to more than 40 language.

And a huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series, which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director...and it also made some Cinematic Records back then,.


With the announcement of pushing the publishing date of Book Five to mid. 2003 , and with 2 movies out so far, The Hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on..

So, As more readers from this generation start to increase , Publishers and Book Stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more..
Older Fantasy books , like Lord of the Rings Narnia , Golden Compass and many other novels start getting more reprinted editions. And so Book Stores prosperity increased as it get more and more readers.


More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon.. The English edition AND the local translated ones , both been sold everywhere worldwide.


Even in English edition sold at many books stores. And, hopefully, some New Book Stores specialized in English novels and books start to open in Cairo & Alexandria by 2002-2003..

And in summer 2002, after the Movie wild success, Nahdet Masr publishing house got the rights and published the Arabic edition.
Although it cut some of the lines for length issues, the edition still hold the magic of it ..making a very good sales.


The good news is, the literary movement didn't stop there, Harry Potter and Reprinted Classics. No , there's more new books come out for the increasing demand from the readers..

By ,, Man Booker winner make very good sales numbers.

And in Dan Brown released a novel that made Huge Fuss around and making a new sales records, ..
the Second Most Selling Book in History after the Bible

A month later, , Khaled Hosseini released his first novel, which also made a very good records too.

And all that didn't affect the main reason for this new 'Literal Renaissance'.
All that didn't affect the Records Breaker to break records one month later..

On book Five comes out..

Ten thousands of all ages conquer the Book Stores in UK, US and other countries too at the same day to get The One Book they've been waiting for at least 2 years. Shipping agents like FedEx made the delivery to many countries to get the book at the same time.

,5 millions copy at the first day only..
For the first time in France a non french language book placed in no.1 of the bestselling book....

Some kids got a headache called 'Harry Potter Headache' as they read the whole 850 pages of the book five, the biggest so far, at the same day without resting.

And in , September the same year, the Arabic edition of book three comes out with unexpected sales records, first edition run out of the stores by the first week only, though it's nearly the beginning of the School year, and the movie of this 3rd book still filming.
ِAnd the price of it get higher 20% in 2 days and still with increasing demand..

More English books and novels sold in Egypt too, along with the Arabic ones, publishing more books for new Egyptian authors and writers along with more of the famous ones, Alaa El Aswany's debut Novel 'Yaqubean's Building' making a very good selling numbers..

And in the Arabic edition of Book Four makes a price war between book stores and magazines stands.
, an abridged translated edition of Book Five make many readers angry in Egypt , specially that many already read the English edition before, so the publisher release an unabridged one by May.

And on , that breaks all the previously ones

6.9 million copy of Book Six sold in US in its first day only...
A huge book, it may not be as the fans' expectations of being full of action , but it get a twist that blow minds about one of the most interesting characters, That made many fans and even big authors like Stephen King and Salman Rushdie talk about for months..

With Pre-Final Book of Harry Potter is out, it followed by a massive variety of New Novels, New Series, New Authors..
, and much more, more Books Sales not only in US, UK but worldwide..
More Novels hit the top sales..
A Real Prosperity.

But still Harry Potter is the Records Big Breaker...

At the midnight before , Everywhere around the Globe, the scene of thousands of people lining in front of Book Stores was repeated...even Bigger than any time before..

A Huge Record for Pre-Orders online reach to One Million copies by Amazon only, and total sales of

The book sold at the Same Day almost in Every Single Country..


even in Israel which made a big religious fuss because the Book Stores opened to receive and sell the book at the releasing day which was their holy Saturday, But it's Harry Potter after all, the world's most unusual, unexpected phenomenon and sales records breaker.

And that's not bad, it was the Miracle of bringing back readers to Book Stores...

And it's not just Harry Potter...
Now, that , thousands of topics went online asking 'what to read next'....
Indeed, although there's the e-books, e-readers..etc, still there's thousands of new books and novels published and sold every year , in every where in the world.

The gaming devices is increasing? yes, But not as expected though by the 90s and early 2000s .. but so does the reading devices which first come out by Sony in 2004,make big step by Amazon's Kindle in 2007...the ebook applications on every device.


New books and series come after that, and still on, making super sales, attracting more readers... more writers come with more books and novels, some are just a rip off others and some are really original and brilliant. in UK, US , Egypt ..everywhere all over the globe..

No matter a Playstation 4 is out, or new Xbox, the Books still there...with its most beloved magic..

The magic of books is back and , I believe, to stay..

Don't you see with me that the magic of Harry Potter is one of the main factors of this magic?



That's what Rowling wrote at the very early pages of her first book.. The one that rejected by 12 Publishing Houses in 1996..

Well, what about now?



Well, that's it for this review... I guess some still think it's just the Propaganda that made that all....
Well I'll try to prove them wrong by the upcoming next 6 reviews at the other 6 Books of the series..
Links will be here as soon as it'd done ..

But for The First one... sorry to add one more , but 20000 characters aren't enough.



Now I'll be back to go around Hogwarts...


For the Zillionth time I guess..

Hope to see you there too, come on and try first year :)

16,17,5,"I have absolutley no idea why goodreads deleted my review AND rating but thankfully I still had it saved! So here it is again, may it stick around this time!

”It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.”

Okay, here’s the thing: There are already 96.502 reviews about this book on goodreads and I think it’s safe to say that mine will carry no weight. *lol*
So I decided to make this a short “my thoughts about this book” review. ;-P

1.)

I totally forgot how horrible the Dursleys are and I think I kind of suppressed how dreadful Dudley is! Such a spoilt brat and this is actually putting it more than just lightly. If anyone should go to a boot camp sort of school it certainly should be him.

2.)

Bless Hagrid for being the kind and compassionate man that he is! <3 Those lines went down in Harry Potter history and started it all! XD

3.)


Haha! You gotta love the Weasley twins! They might be side characters but they always manage to bring some humour into the book and they succeed to give that typical sibling and family vibe. =)

4.)

When I read this I totally had the Hermione of the movie in my mind. Emma Watson played her so well and I’m really glad that Hermione came off her high horse. She was really insufferable at the beginning of the book. *lol*

5.)

Urgh! And so it begins! I never liked Malfoy and I’ll never do. Sorry, guys! Yes, I felt sorry for him after book 5 but he’s still a slimy little spoilt brat at the beginning of the series. Still, if his parents would have raised him differently he might have even turned out to be a nice guy. *sighs*

6.)

And here comes another character I’ll never forgive. Snape is a horrible teacher and an even worse human being. There I said it. Nothing that happens over the course of the following books will change anything about the fact that he’s unfair and mean to his students! His past doesn’t excuse his actions. Still, I gotta give Rowling kudos for all the foreboding! Boy, alone the comment with the bezoar. XD And Dumbledore explaining the relationship between Snape and Harry’s father. Well done! ;-)

7.)

I still love that scene and I’m really glad Hermione and the others finally bonded. Also, I love that they tried to be good kids at the beginning. In the first book they actually don’t want to do anything forbidden and feel bad about it. Well, and then the other books happen. *LOL* Apparently practice makes perfect though, because they go for plenty of forbidden things but don’t get caught anymore. Haha!

8.)

Lee Jordan is the best! <3 He’s the main reason I enjoy the Quidditch games so much! His commentary is just funny and brilliant!

9.)

I LOVE HARRY’S DEFIANCE!!! That’s one of the many things that made me like him so much! He never backs down and always continues to fight. No matter the odds, he’s facing his troubles holding his head high! Even this early in the series you can already see that he’s going to be a great MC!

And now let’s move on and read book two! ;-)"
17,18,5,"As wonderful and magical as promised. Because I didn't remember the movie, the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to me.

I wish I'd had this book when I was a kid, because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it, and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to me.

Anne's finishing this, too, and I have to wait for her before I start in on the second book ... HURRY UP ANNE!"

Let me dream.
I'm reading for the first time this book to my daughter (6 years old), but for me (37 years old) it's the third time I read ""Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone"". Everyone should read this book, if only to realize why the phenomenon ""Harry Potter"" has spread. With an essential and enjoyable style, catapults the reader into a fantasy world, populated by wizards and flying broomsticks, unicorns and talking hats. A world where even the most complicated topics, such as the death, are treated with delicate gentleness.

this book is the Magical gate to the Wizarding World.
introducing this amazing unique world to us.

(all my HP reviews were written after many times read, not first, first was back in early 2000s)

This book,
All these books,
This world,
has a special place in my heart.❤


this review is mostly about my memories/feelings, I just wanted to have them somewhere.


Many of us dreamed of receiving our letter, going to Hogwarts, learning magic. we bought our wands. we were ready to experience magic.

but you know...
We actually received our letter
We found platform 9¾
We attended Hogwarts
We were sorted into Houses
We were there together
all along
with Harry Potter

because...

★ We
Are
★ Potterheads

as Stephen King said:


& Martin said:




so don't be sad potterheads, we were there!




actually HP1 was the first 'novel' of my life. the one that made me a lover & a ! the one that introduced the world of bigger books & magic. I was 9, summer 2001 & it was my (very) belated birthday gift (& I'm grateful for that); long ago, before there was a hype, 1st movie was about to come out. so I just read this one book I had again & again & again... (I guess I bought 2nd soon after, & re-read them together :D)
I remember my feelings at the first read; like I was thrilled because I thought that 'H' on the seal was because of Harry's initial.


Take me back to my childhood, when everything seemed simpler...
I've grown up with this series & loved every minutes of it.
this book & this series never gets old. still as excellent as my first read, even though I know all the details & even many of the sentences.


fun great beginning
Cute story, magical, brilliant, unique with many lovable characters in a magnificent castle & wonderful world.




every chapters; amazing. interesting. intriguing!
Wonderful!
Epic!
Wow!!!
Quidditch!
Friendship!



I love this quote!

I enjoy these stories happening in this world, the real world.
also the ones you can be sorted in the story & feel you are really there.

cute courageous & (yeah I'm gonna say it, because he is in the great matters of life) wise Harry
loyal daring Ron
& smart book lover Hermione
hilarious twins!
Lee Jordan's commentating!
Professor McGonagall!
Wood!
oh Hagrid! XD

the learning magic was lovely & the plot twists kept me open-mouthed!

After this many times re-read (which is not accurate, but I know I read them a lot! so I estimated each year that I read, before new books coming out, every summer at least for the first couple of years, & here I am, 20 re-read for the first book.) I actually knew most of the sentences & of course I know what would happen next, but it is still as interesting & cute as the first time, even if the element of surprise is long gone for me; but I can completely remember which parts I stare at the book with an open mouth. :D
Every time I missed them & start to re-read them, nostalgic & delighted, I am that 9 yo little girl who loved this world, which crafted my childhood & teenage years, majority of my life & memory, teaching me many things.

June 2018 was my first time that I tried HP in English (after so many times reading; 11 times for book 1 & 2 to 5-6 times for book 6 & 7) & I can say it was even more AMAZING. <3
Audiobook is like reading in the dark, isn't it?; you don't need light to stay up all night reading. XD

21,22,5,"It is now 2023 and Harry Potter is now 25 years old. It is hard to fathom that days may be long but time passes quickly, and, yet, Harry has been around for my entire adult life. Time marches on. I hope he is just as beloved when my future grandchildren are old enough to read his story.

In 2020, I decided to reread the Harry Potter series again with friends in the Retro Chapter Chicks group. As adults we lead busy lives. There are infinite numbers of books published and with this lack of time, we need something magical, especially in the winter months when the sun doesn’t shine as much in the northern hemisphere. My solution to the winter doldrums was revisiting Harry Potter’s magical world even if for some of us like myself it is at least the 20th time reading the series. Magic has a way of brightening one’s day and in any saga you can pick up new intricacies with each read through. The best part will be the discussions afterward but after all these times there is nothing like hearing “You’re a Wizard, Harry”, and there is something magical in hearing those words as I began my reading year on New Year’s Day.

I have read Harry Potter more times than I have fingers and toes, and all four of my kids have read the entire series through twice. They have indulged in fan fiction and been sorted into houses on Pottermore. At this point, I have two Slytherins, two Ravenclaws, and my husband who is determined to take test again because he was inadvertently sorted into Hufflepuff. Of course, he claims it’s ok because Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson is supposedly also in Hufflepuff. That is how much Harry Potter has permeated society, to the point where the gulf between the books and fan fiction is at an all time low. Harry Potter was first published in 1998 and has been around my entire adult life. Imagine if it existed when I was my kids’ ages and had the luxury of reading for the first time at age five or six. By this point in my life, I would have the entire series memorized the way I can rattle off lines from the original Star Wars trilogy verbatim. Like Star Wars, Harry Potter is timeless. It was also written by an author who was unsure if it would be successful and initially only submitted the first book to be published. How wrong was J.K. Rowling when it came to betting on herself as more than twenty years later she has created an entire empire out of her franchise.

There is something about adolescence that places a child in a gap between childhood and adulthood that makes it a magical time in one’s life. Just yesterday my twelve-year-old daughter noted that she wants to be an adult because she’s too old to be a kid but too young to drive or do adult things. Point taken. What I have always loved about this first installment besides discovering about the magical world for the first time is how young Harry and his friends are. He notes at one point to Ron and Hermoine that Dumbledore gave them the tools to succeed and it was up to them to complete their tasks. Just as in real life an adolescent needs guidance, they are also capable of doing many things on their own, but they are oh so needy. Like Harry was when he didn’t know how to get to platform 9 3/4 or how to mount a broomstick or how any of the first year students still are in need of a helping hand of the prefects to show them the way as they navigate Hogwarts for the first time. Having kids in this age range allows for me to think wow, parents are allowing their eleven year old children to go away for school. They are entrusting others to help raise their children in this big, scary world that we live in. And the children in turn become independent at a younger than usual age, fostering layers upon layers of character development that Rowling employs even from this first book. It is little wonder that I was giddy to get started with the series again.

In this 2020 reading I have noticed yet again that Rowling has set the stage for events that will come later on in the series. They can be as mundane as the mention of Nicholas Flamel on the back of a chocolate frog card, or as crucial as Harry noting that Snape appears to be able to read minds. Knowing what we know about Snape and his character development makes me laugh at this line, only because I know of all the adventures that will occur and how Snape is either in the way or foiled by Harry in the end. I also noticed this time around the gulf between love and evil and that Harry’s mother’s love for him is something Voldemort can not understand. The stage is set for the interplays between Harry and Snape and the many iterations of Voldemort here in the first book, and one needs to read carefully so as not to miss anything. Reading this many times, I still managed to gain something new, and I think this time around, my key theme will be the characterization of every character, major and minor, and the nuances in dialogue between various personas. Harry having an aha moment about Hagrid might have been lost to me at age twenty but I get immediately and find myself chuckling a bit at age forty. As the books get longer and darker, these conversations which I once thought were fillers will become all the more important to the development of the plot, and I look forward to reaching them later in the series.

I am thankful that I have finally reached a stage where I am captivated by a plethora of books, not just one series like I was as a younger, less experienced reader or when I had little time for hefty books when I had young children in the house. I am glad that J.K. Rowling created this world so that kids can foster a love of reading and become lifelong readers. For that, nineteen years later, I can still turn to Harry in times of need and be grateful that Harry, Ron, and Hermoine will always be there for readers in need of an escape from the vagaries of everyday life. I recently bought the series for myself so I can turn to this ultimate comfort read in times of need and not be reliant upon the library for my copy. Being able to read a whole book in a day or favorite passages is pure magic to say the least. So in 2020 I will be undertaking seven years of magic again. The kids are at a stage when they read from the teen section of the library and I find myself craving children’s books. Needless to say I need some magic in my life as I read about other teenagers and adolescents as a means of escaping the everyday stress that comes with raising kids that age of my own. It should be a fun journey and now that I have book 1 under my belt again, I look forward to spending a good chunk of my 2020 reading year inside of Hogwarts.

As always, 5 stars"
22,23,5,"i think everyone has that one book that made you fall in love with reading, one book that opened your eyes to a world beyond the one in which you live, one book that burrowed itself inside your heart and became a part of you, one book that will forever feel like coming home every time you read it.

i know im not original when i say harry potter is that one book (and series) for me, but this is what got me into reading. it gave me a childhood far more magical and imaginative than i could have ever asked for. the series taught me the value of empathy, that courage comes in many different forms, the importance of having and being a true friend, that love is the greatest power above all, and most importantly, it taught me to believe in magic. i would not be who i am today without this book and i love that stories have the power to do that, to change lives for the better.

i owe so much to this little book that became such a massive part of my life. and to think it all started with a young boy who lived under the stairs. <3"

Some years ago, I was a young child when the first Harry Potter book became a sensation. I was a lazy kid who thought that books, especially novels, were overrated and a waste of time. My only acquaintance with them was a couple of the Secret Seven books by Enid Blyton.

My father is a voracious reader. He knew I would start loving books if I found out how amazing books are. He never forced me to read. He just told me the importance of reading and kept a few books like the Secret Seven, Sherlock Holmes, and the first Harry Potter on my table. I still never bothered even to touch it.

One day I was stuck in my home and had nothing else to do. So I simply took the Harry Potter and the philosophers stone and decided to read just five pages. After that, I could not put the book down (just like all other kids); I discarded eating my lunch and finished reading it in just a single sitting. From that day onwards, I started loving books. I never stopped reading after that day. I am proud to say that after high school, I have been following a routine of reading at least ten pages from some book every day. I didn't drop this routine even during tough Med School exam time. This hobby has helped me a lot in developing my personality. It gave me patience and empathy and helped me a lot to become a Doctor. I have to thank my father, , the Harry Potter series, , and for developing this reading habit in me.

My favorite character in this book is Harry. It is because of his simplicity, vulnerability, and innocence. There is one more important reason why I love Harry. perfectly mentioned it in his book . Harry was removed from his distinguished family and brought up by ordinary muggles, and he arrived at Hogwarts without any prior experience in magic. Nothing was given to him on a silver platter. He had to struggle and work hard to become the best. All the hard-working people who had to struggle in their life will find Harry as their inspiration. He is not the best in everything he does. He is vulnerable with all the negatives and positives like every one of us. JK Rowling shows every young kid you will succeed if you work hard despite the hardships through Harry's character.

Later, every character became my favorite, and they were like my close friends. When I enter a great educational institution or library in my life, the first thing that comes to my mind is, wow, it looks like Hogwarts. That is the standard that JK Rowling built through this book. Hogwarts (even though fictional) is the gold standard for educational institutions for every book lover in this world.

Harry Potter is the book in which I have seen the best world-building. It is amazing to see the author giving mannerisms to certain characters keeping in mind that they will be used for the final book several years later.

Harry, Ron and the Weasley family, Hermione, Dumbledore, Hagrid, Hedwig, platform 9 3/4, Hogwarts Express, Hogwarts, Quidditch, Nicholas Flamel, Draco, Snape, and even Voldemort will all bring nostalgia to everybody's mind who grew up reading Harry Potter."
24,25,5,"""Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!""

I wasn't always the most ardent fantasy reader, but even since reading The Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy, that quickly changed. And figured what better way to continue the journey than Harry Potter. I'm very glad I did so. Had I really known how fun and thrilling Harry Potter is, I would've read all books many times over by now. But better late than never I guess.

""Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers - I mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.""

Right off from the beginning, what stood out to me most was, how easy it is to read everything. May be it is because the author moves mainly along building characters - which are much quickly understood - instead of building a detailed fantasy world. Unlike in a Tolkien novel, where we are given every minuscule detail of the world, Harry Potter is far more character focused, and has been done amazingly. I never dreamed I'll this fascinated by a children's book.

""There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.""

Now that I'm finished with the first book, I cannot help regretting why didn't I read this before. This is far far better than watching the movie - and considering how enjoyable the movies are, that's saying a lot. Definitely going to re-visit this one, many times hopefully. Cannot wait to start reading the next one.

26,27,5,"Come along with me on my re-read of the epically magical series “Harry Potter”. 🤓⚡️My journey this time around will be a hybrid of reading the books, listening to a fun (adult) podcast and watching the movies. 🤗❤️📚🎧🎬

⚠️There are definitely some spoilers ahead, so stop reading now, if you’re unfamiliar with the amazingly fantastic world of Hogwarts.⚠️
Personal Opinion Note: I’m very sad for you, if you’ve never read the books (or at least watched the movies). 😉

Unlike the majority of my reviews, this one is gonna be looooooooong 😬 as I’ll be updating it along the way. So buckle up- it’s bound to be a fun ride (for me… anyway…. cause I’m driving 🤣😂). Seriously… get out now if you’re not up for this adventure…. O…. K….. okay…. let’s go!!! 📚🎧🎬

📚Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived
What an introduction. I’m already so excited to be re-reading this series. We’ve been introduced to The Dursley’s, Albus Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hagrid. Short re-cap: Poor one year old Harry has lost his parents thanks to “he-who-must-not-be-named” and is being dropped off to live with “muggles” (aka non-magic-folk aka his Aunt and Uncle and cousin aka The Dursley’s) because he’ll be too known/famous in the wizard world and it’s deemed the safest place for him.

📚Chapter 2: The Vanishing Glass
Ughhhhhh…. Dudley… that is the perfect name for Harry’s Dud of a cousin. This kid is the definition of spoiled brat. Short re-cap: It’s Dudley’s birthday and they take a trip to the zoo. Harry realizes he can understand a snake talking and accidentally makes the glass in the enclosure disappear.

📚Chapter 3: The Letters From No One
Can you imagine having your bedroom be a cupboard under the stairs? The Dursley’s really are crap muggles. Short re-cap: Mysterious letters start to arrive for Harry, addressed very specifically (ex: the cupboard under the stairs). Uncle Vernon refuses to let Harry read any of them, at all costs.

Short re-cap: Hagrid tracks down Harry to hand deliver his letter (acceptance to Hogwarts) along with a birthday cake. He’s furious to find that Harry has no idea he’s a wizard. He puts the Dursley’s in their place and changes Harry’s life as he knew it.

This is so spot on. I feel like I just discussed the world with my besties. They make so many valid points and I found myself saying “Yes!!” and “I know, right?!” in agreement with all they have to say. Soooo entertaining and worth the listen!

The Hogwarts Express sounds so magically amazing. The thought that went into each detail, even the treats from the cart, so awesome. Short re-cap: Harry learns how to get through the platform for the train, thanks to the Weasley’s (aka the best magical family ever). He meets his new BFF Ron and the super-smart Hermione.

📚Chapter 7: The Sorting Hat
Entering the dining hall with its enchanted ceiling and delicious foods would be incredible to anyone. But to a boy who has had little to nothing, it’d be astonishing. Short re-cap: The students are sorted into one of four houses- Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. Harry is pleased to be selected for Gryffindor, and not Slytherin (the house bad wizards tend to come from aka Volda… I mean… he-who-must-not-be-named).

***Warning: podcast has adult content***
Oh my, this is funny- adult humor funny! They are on point!! That sorting hat, man, oh man- it’s definitely a key part of the story. It is indeed funny, knowing who they end up with, to hear their first impressions of each other.

📚Chapter 11: Quidditch
Hagrid really is the sweetest and loyalist, but man, he lets things slip, lol. At this point Snape really is terrible. Short re-cap: Harry’s first Quidditch game and his broom gets bewitched. It appears to be Snape’s doing. After winning the game, Harry tells Hagrid that he thinks the three headed dog bit Snape and Hagrid let’s it slip that it’s his dog Fluffy, protecting something for Dumbledore.

I love that it takes all three of our trio, working together to get through. Short re-cap: Hagrid let’s it slip that he told a stranger how to get past Fluffy. The trio decide to tell Dumbledore that the stone is in danger, only to discover he’s gone. They decide to go after the stone themselves, to keep it safe.

📚Chapter 17: The Man with Two Faces
The creepiest part of this book, Voldemort attached to the back of Quirrell’s head! Short re-cap: Harry discovers Quirrell, not Snape, is after the stone. Voldemort is unable to touch Harry, who uses this to his advantage. Dumbledore arrives in time to save Harry and the stone.

My goodness, this is a great podcast. They point out the hidden messages, the faults, the ridiculous, the marvelous…. I can’t stress this enough- this podcast contains adult content, language, innuendos, spoilers- so use digression before diving in.

🎬Movie #1
I greatly appreciate all the visual elements of this world coming to life in a movie. From the moment Hagrid bangs down the door to pick up Harry, you’re fully immersed in this magical world. But I’ll still always say, the books are better than the movies. Because, they are! It’s semi disappointing that Neville is missing so much from the film, cause he’s really a great character.

🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Movie
***Warning: podcast has adult content***
I loved this episode. They really hit the nail on the head. From the bits that were missing, to the bits that were added. It’s refreshing to have these two put into words what true potter fans have observed.

This, my friends, wraps up my revisit of The Sorcerers Stone. I’m so glad that I decided to go back and re-read the books. This added element of podcast and movie, has made it that much more entertaining."
27,28,5,"It´s never too late to get back to magic school, even if one is just a dirty muggle.

Quite a while ago (I was young, so young, omg, what happened, where is all the time, how could this hopeful young boy become such a demoni…), sorry, typo; I read this thing and now I thought that a reread might be an extremely interesting experience, especially regarding my obsession of vivisecting literature with the help of the almighty tvtropes. But there is a problem.

I have a massive deficit of reading all kinds of fantasy because the series take such huge amounts of time, there is a hyperinflation of YA and high fantasy and I am more into sci-fi, humor, and horror, so I can´t really compare it with other, similar kids and YA fantasy literature. But I can just cherrypick any weird thought, Frankenstein it together, mwuahahaha call it a review, post it, run, and hope that nobody notices. I should have put this to the end of the review…

It would be really interesting to know which elements were already there, maybe even in similar constellations, and which were Rowlings´ own, unique inventions. The underdog group of friends, the systems of magic, the only sure thing and constant in fantasy might be the big bad evil lurking in the background while the sockpuppet antagonistic humans prepare the final war. More comparisons could be interesting in the other direction, the future, my obsession, too because there might have been the one or other opportunistic genre swifts, series, subgenres heavily influenced by Harry that are now beginning to collide with newer hypes and trends. Quite a freaking amazing evolution.

I am not sure if a man could have written a similar piece, because there are, gosh, gender differences. Yes, I just dissed and discriminated against my own gender, sue me if you want, I´ve legal expenses insurance so good luck with that, but my perfectly politically incorrect opinion is that there are genres and readers that just perfectly fit together. Or not, and in these cases, different genders, gender identities, etc. are prone to reading and writing gender specific content. Although there may be female hard sci-fi, plot focused writers with minimalistic characterizations and male authors writing soft epic, romantic fantasy, they are exceptions and I don´t deem this diversity something negative. On the contrary, I will just shout out that a man would maybe not have been able to write such a compelling book and that Potter could have failed, or at least not have had such immense success, without the feminine touch. Now I´ll be roasted, trolled, and hunted down, but that was totally worth it. Stupid haters, get a life. I should really consider reducing the offending the audience level.

Rowling did an immensely good job in using Sandersons´laws of magic to make anything interconnected and somewhat even linking character traits to certain kinds of magic systems, and preferences while aiming at one of the biggest and fangirly/boysest audiences possible, young readers. Many of these won´t have seen similar uses in old, unknown works or still too difficult to enter high fantasy concepts and will be blown away when they first enter this amazing universe.

Faith stereotypically and predictably, far less creative and open minded than the young readers, helped in promoting Potter by talking about the danger of magic and such trivial, evil works on kids and children. Really, bigots, did you learn nothing out of 2 millennia of religious wars, witch burning, and genocides? Sigh, as already said, haters gonna hate, but at least this ridiculous attempts of demonizing one of the most pop cultural big bangs of all time helped to make it even more popular. What did they fear, that millions of boys and girls start doing black magic, break quantum dimensional time travel stuff, and unleash the flying spaghetti monster that would ruin their assets?

The extreme success of Rowlings´ excessive use of adjectives and breaking many other rules of this, so called, self proclaimed, quality newspaper writing gurus, high brow literature, „I´ll tell anyone to write just with my, only right, recipe, because this is how art has to be done and creativity has to be unleashed under controlled circumstances“ is a good reason for rofling around all day. Seriously, Nobel price, elitist high culture literature trash woman/man? How many people would read your favorite, old and cheap as dirt, garbage if schools and universities wouldn´t buy this ridiculous, bad writing (fueled by nationalism, pride about the big sons (why no sisters?), each nation on earth with its own, terrible, old big prodigies of writing weird, boring, bad concoctions because they were the only freaking, elitist people writing something centuries or decades ago) to torture helpless young people and make them hate reading for the rest of their lives. Close to nobody! And honestly, what´s wrong with you ever so sophisticated literary critics, fine arts professors, and wannabe pseudo intellectuals, looking down at literature that kids love and that´s made for them while promoting the haters troll train that bores them out, steals their time, and makes them functional illiterates? Go, Harry, transform them from the inside out into the slimy, stinky creatures they truly are. That escalated quickly.

Looking at a kind of big history picture of the socio cultural impact of one of the most successful fantasy series ever, one could ironically say, that it´s the ultimate, exaggerated interpretation of what could be behind the words, using soft sciences and magics. Maybe doing so is wrong, true, ingenious, stupid, deep, a waste of time, however, how audiences perceive and philosophy about groundbreaking works, by reflecting its impact, is maybe one of the greatest extra joys of reading.

One of the coolest magic tricks would be to reactivate the fully immersive flow and flash of reading when young, but I can at least feed on the reminiscences of already quite blurry pictures and sharpen them while rereading one of the most groundbreaking fantasy works ever that helped make hundreds of millions of kids, and the one or other adult, avid readers.

Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:


A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books:"
28,29,5,"The first HP novel is already a classic. I have read it in the original English and the (slightly disappointing IMHO) French translation because my kid, just a few months after starting reading, plunged head first into this book and only resurfaced after the last one. I never made it past the 3td book but admittedly really enjoyed this book. It is the most light-hearted and funny of the series despite the darkness of the One Who Cannot Be Named. The universe created by Rowling is one of the most complete and compelling ones ever for kids - that I will freely admit. I obviously would love to witness a quiddich match and go to a class dealing with mandrakes and eat in that fabulous dining hall. That being said, it seems to be quite a lonely life - the idealisation in a sense of pensions for kids of rich (or in this case) magical families is perhaps a tad disturbing when you want to be a more hands-on parent and these parents apparently have no issue with only seeing their kids on holidays and during the summer. I am not sure I could do that, but that is just me perhaps.

An extremely entertaining and memorable tale that my kids both adored in both book and movie form!

Just finished reading HP1 aloud to my son in English and found it to be very enjoyable. The plot does stick together, the characters are endearing (I love Ron's little side remarks about Hermione in the beginning), and the imagination Rowling deployed to create this magical universe is astounding. I cannot believe that this first book is already 20 years old! It has really aged well. I cannot really point to any weaknesses at all. It was entertaining and a pure joy to share with my son - his first time through in English! I believe I will set a 2017-2018 goal to finish all 7 books this time around! Finished #2 on audiobook so on to Azkaban now."

• original review below •

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~





Why? Well, because I'm I've always told myself that Harry Potter might be something that I won't like, something I won't enjoy. In my head, I kept telling myself that wizards just aren't my thing and all that stupid shit. I honestly don't know why I did that though. But I finally got over my doubt and picked this up and I'm speechless. In a good way of course! It was super good! Next time, for any book series I want to read, I shall never listen to that in my head. I will read anything I want to anytime, anywhere! Especially Harry Potter :)



First off, let me talk about Harry Potter. This guy, is He is one of the few characters I've ever read about that no matter what, stays strong and doesn't let anyone influence him or change his view on things. And that's what I admire most about Harry. If he thinks something isn't right, he sets his mind to it and tries to fix it, regardless of what others say around him. Now me on the other hand, is the complete opposite. I'm the person that cowers behind people and stays quiet. I don't like drawing attention to myself. But Harry really made me see that in certain circumstances, I need to raise my voice and stand up for what I believe is right. Really, I could go on and on, but Harry Potter is just uhhh, I can't even put into words what I'm feeling right now!



Next, Ronald Weasley is He's funny and well, just Ron. I love his personality and his quirkiness. I wish I had a friend like him. Ron is just that kind of person that can make you laugh or turn a really serious situation into something funny and silly. It's always good to know a person like Ron. Sometimes they come in handy. Also, I I have tried multiple times to play, but I will understand the rules and strategies of chess. Ron seriously needs to give me a few lessons on how to play chess.



Hermione Granger: she knows her facts, studies hard, and is that At first, I thought she was so bratty. I have to admit, I wasn't really fond of her at first, but as the story progressed, I grew to like her. She's super nice and has Harry and Ron's backs no matter what. Hermione is loyal and just uhhh, again I can't put into words how much I love this girl! Plus, I have her wand. One of my aunts went to ""The Wizarding World of Harry Potter"" in Universal Studios located in Orlando, Florida like, years ago. At the time, I've of of HP but was never really interested in it. And she came back with Hermione's wand, which looks super badass, if you ask me ;) So I'm proud to say that I have some HP merchandise. To add, she also got me a HP bookmark that's a hook and you just hook it to the inside of your book.



Hogwarts is so cool! It's scary yet beautiful at the same time!



I would go on about each individual character, but that would be too many words and by the time you get there, you'd probably already be asleep xD So I'll just leave it here. About the rest of all the characters in this book, each and everyone of them were wonderful! As well as the plot! And that surprise twist at the end, I never saw coming! Magnificent book and can't wait to start book 2! :)

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

I feel so left out on the world Harry Potter and don't have a clue what people are talking about, so I think it's about time I read this baby.

Super excited!"
30,31,5,"***that mirror scene is still making me cry. Curse you, JK. I will take revenge ☺️"
31,32,5,"“It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.”

This book was as enchanting as it was to 11 year old me when my sister put Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone in my hands and told me I simply have to read this series.

Harry Potter meant so much to me as a kid as it did to millions of others. It was a magical world I could fall into and experience Harry's amazing adventures with him. I read them over and over and it took me many years to finally come out of my Harry Potter bubble and realize that there other books for me to read and love as well.

I haven't done a reread since I was 16 so it has been 7 years since I've read any of the HP books.

I'm sure you all know how this story goes




Harry Potter lives with his horrible aunt, uncle and cousin (the Dursleys). Forced to sleep in the small room under the staircase, he is reminded everyday of his life that he is nothing more than an ordinary boy and an inconvenience. No matter what the Dursleys say, strange and inexplicable things always seem to happen to and around Harry.



And though his uncle and aunt try to stop events from unfolding, one day a giant stranger arrives at their door to finally tell Harry the truth about who he really is and to invite him to attend the prestigious, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.



But even in the magical world Harry is not ordinary. He is the boy who lived. The boy who the dark sorcerer, Lord Voldemort, failed to kill and who's impossible survival caused Voldemort to vanish.



Life at Hogwarts is great, Harry has finally found a place he belongs. But his wonderful life at Hogwarts is disrupted when Harry and friends, Ron and Hermione, stumble upon clues to strange happenings that they simply cannot ignore. Something important is being kept safe at Hogwarts, but our trio know that it won't be safe for long and take it upon themselves to investigate and stop it from falling into evil hands.




I was a bit surprised by how short the chapters are and how fast the plot moved. As a kid it seemed so much longer, but I should have expected that now that I am a faster reader. 😂

As I usually do an annual HP movie marathon, the actors faces immediately pop into my head and I cannot help but picturing them during this reread.

This is definitely a foundation book, where the rest of the plot will be built upon. But it did not lack excitement and it had the right amount of charm. I like that as you go through the books there is still so much to learn about Hogwarts and the magical world. It honestly would not have been as enchanting if we new everything from the first book.

This book is just the beginning of Harry's life at Hogwarts and I am so excited to move through the years with him!

32,33,5,"Do I even need to list all the reasons why this book was a joy to read?
The writing style was easy to read, but wasn't simple or standard. It still had its unique twist to it, which lead to me finally reading one of those books, where you just can't decide what age group it was written for. I genuinely believe that the story would be enjoyed by everyone; whether it's my 10-year-old brother or my grandma (who is about to turn 80) - they all would have a pleasant and joyful reading experience. I also totally did not expect to laugh so much while reading - there's some really dry and wonderful humor in here.

Despite this being my first time reading Harry Potter, the story wasn't new to me. I was a huge fan of the first five movies when they were released (but for some reason never bothered to watch the rest?? I don't understand my younger self...). My obsession was quite big for a while, but after the initial enthusiasm had ceased, I never watched any of them again. In retrospect I've got to say that this was a good thing, because I now got more and more excited every time I recognized a name or remembered a scene that came up.

If I had to criticize anything, it would be about the length of some of the more intense scenes. I guess they could have done with a bit more build-up. However, that's really just nitpicking, and the main reason for that complaint is my wish for the book to have more pages so I could be staying in this world for a longer duration and finding out more about the (lovely) characters.
It also needs to be taken into consideration that this is just the first installment of a series with seven parts. Looking at the length of some of the later books, I'm sure I will get my wish fulfilled in the near future."
33,34,5,"This is where it all began, where we were introduced to Harry Potter, Rowling's magical world, a series of exciting adventures and the excellent characters and environments she has given to English literature. It set the standard for contemporary fantasy. Rowling make full use of classic literary and mythological references, freeing herself from the confines of the merely topical, while giving it all a daring sense of newness. This series will live forever.

;





-that fast?!!-
Remember there's some small package in Ch.5, you read something about a failed stealing attempt in Ch.8, then suspecting it might be the school's heavily guarded item in ch.9.
With pure chances our Harry Potter witnessed it all so far.
Now, also by chances, Harry start to suspect someone trying to steal it, from the school.

It all start with a sequence of events that may some of it give you Nostalgia, like having annoying knows-it-all colleague.

Well, then, one thing after another,

And we have a;

I want to be back in school already.





While playing Magical Sport that once you read its rules -twice-, you'll wish to play it,

even if against the worst team ever, Slytherin.


And While staying at school during Christmas, this intimate atmosphere,

even having family however they might be, but they're still your blood.. (as we’ll discuss that in later parts.)







;





















































And as the investigations part ends finally, it was moment for Truth.



So, we still won't have the full answers we seek and have in our mind such as;
If this is a great story, Why would a Man even so evil as Voldemort would be that keen to kill baby Harry that much in the first place?
Will he return? Will it be convenience one?

Full review of book one written in Nov. 2016"
37,38,5,"This was so much fun reading this in French! I was a bit anxious from at first if I would be able to understand everything, but it turned out fine.




And the funny thing is that after all these years I find it extremely stupid how Gryffindor (or Gryffondor) won in the end.

I loved how some things were called differently in French, very interesting!
Here are few to mention.
Poudlard
Madame Guipure
Drago Malefoy
Neville Londubat
Severus Rogue
Gryffondor
Poufsouffle
Serdaigle
Serpentard"
38,39,5,"I was never a Harry Potter kid. I honestly harshly judged Harry Potter readers my entire life. I was a Series of Unfortunate Event's weirdo. I was a Lemony Snicket child. I was a member of VFD and I knew how to write acrostic poems.
Harry Potter was too popular. It was too cool. It was too massively praised. JK Rowling made too much fucking money (still does). It was TOO MAINSTREAM and edgy middle school me didn't want to be LIKE EVERYONE ELSE."
39,40,5,"I reread Potter 1 - this very book - and was very aware of how inspired, how clever Rowling's storytelling is.

Try as I might, I can't see the current writers of Urban Fantasy or YA paranormal romance beat Rowling in terms of raw writing ability.

How did J.K. Rowling write Sorcerer's stone without magic? She had the same impact on me as...well let's say that as someone who doesn't visit other countries to observe the Sistine chapel or whatever, my top three best art experience is 1. One Piece 2. Harry Potter 3. The Beatles."
40,41,5,"Man, I'm so glad Harry Potter was a huge part of my childhood growing up.
Stephen Fry was bloody brilliant."
41,42,5,"I simply adored this book <3. It was such a fast and funny read! Also, it brought childhood memories back, because I saw the first Harry Potter movie when I was 10 years old, and I was so nostalgic remembering it all <3.

I'm not used to read books after I watched the movies, but it'll be that way with my Harry Potter books, because I'm a huge fan of the movies and I've already saw them all. The good thing is that I don't really remember anything at all, haha (just the ""big"" parts. Oh, and also the deaths *cries*).

Sooo, I loved this book and I'm impressed by that! I mean, I knew I was going to like it! But it was so much more. Since the first page it had me hooked. J.K. Rowling has such a fluid writing style! I never got bored and I was gasping in some parts even when I knew what was going to happen!

Can't wait to read the next books :)."
42,43,5,"Why didn’t anyone tell me —haha —-
I can’t use that excuse —-

Harry Potter is a WIZARD......I had no idea.....
I thought he was a funny looking kid - with funny hair - and round glasses.

It’s true....HARRY POTTER is very famous. J. K. Rowling knew Harry Potter would be ‘famous’ -FOR REAL-
Hello?, with 59,157 customers reviews on Amazon - averaging 5 stars - I’d say he’s a very ‘LIKABLE’ HARRY POTTER ‘FAMOUS’ boy too!

How in the world does a first time author —- this was the first Harry Potter, book, yes? - have the vision to not only create a wizardly wonderful story centered around a neglected boy who lived in a cupboard - with his sad history- know that he
would become a hero....the world’s most famous *HARRY POTTER*? AMAZING!

Book girl -Bossy know-it- all, *Hermione*, chess player great friend *Ron*, street-smart wizardly guide *Hagrid*, father figure *Dumbledore*, etc. etc. etc...major and/or minor characters ....THEY COME ALVE! - Great Characters!

....cats, toads, owls, flying motorcycle ....muggles .....( great new word).....
....wizard boarding school...( of course — it seemed so normal -I BELIEVE)....
....food, - sausages- turkey- cake- chocolate frogs- etc. games, rewards, birthdays - Christmas - punishments, hero’s, villains, sports ( Quiddich)....such a cool game....twists and turns .....suspense
The wave of a magic wand.....HARRY POTTER sure got a magical wizardly lesson of bravery at ‘Wizard Boarding School’.

Incredible.... I honestly ‘never’ thought I’d enjoy Harry Potter, ‘this much’.
I must have been missing some marbles.

An extraordinary book for all ages .....something people have been saying FOR AGES!!!!"

44,45,5,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the most celebrated books of all time for one simple reason...because it deserves to be!



I'll write a full review when I have time, but for now here's my...

review


- Rowling's prose is absolutely magical
- Story is not only exciting but often sweet as well
- Lead characters are all captivating
- Comic relief (mostly from Ron) is blended perfectly with the more dramatic events
- Never a dull moment



- Rowling is occasionally too over-the-top for her own good (especially during Harry's time with the Dursleys)
- After reading this, anything else you do may seem like a waste of time that you could have used to read Harry Potter again!



Some books are worth reading once, this one is worthy reading many times! A brilliant adventure that anyone can enjoy!"
45,46,5,"A re-read for me, this time with my son (who is very reluctant to read anything). This took such a long time, but we finally finished it after months and months, and he's rated it 5 stars! Good grief, if Harry Potter doesn't get him into reading, what hope have I got 😂"
46,47,5,"It was great to read this again, and I will be doing a review on it on YouTube :)"
47,48,5,"I used to hate Harry Potter.



Now before you hoist your pitchforks and torches, allow me to explain.

When I was a wee child of six, my dad decided it'd be a good idea to introduce me to the series—starting from the Goblet of Fire.

Back then, I was a vivacious reader, but mainly of chapter books, like or . The thickest book I'd read was .



So when my dad plunked this gigantic doorstopper of a book in front of me, I quickly lost interest and deemed Harry Potter boring and overhyped. I carried this opinion through my teenage years, rolling my eyes at the people who'd pillaged bookstores at midnight and refusing my uncle's generous offer to purchase me the entire series because he knew I liked to read.

Fast forward to 2009, when I was deep in the clutches of and desperate for something to fill the power vacuum Breaking Dawn had left. Then I stumbled across Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in my school library.

""What the hell,"" I'd thought. ""There's nothing else to read anyway.""

I'd settled on a cushy couch, flicked to the first page and laid eyes on this:

It was all over for me.

I read past the tardy bell, begged the librarian to let me keep it, even though we weren't allowed to check out books that early on in the school year. I zoomed through it in class and snuck the Chamber of Secrets and the Prisoner of Azaban home under my coat. I even pleaded my mother to haul The Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, those thick, heavy hardbacks, home from school's library (my mom's a teacher), so I wouldn't be left Potter-less during the weekend.

Having come across them long overdue, I knew major spoilers, including who would die in the end, yet it still broke my heart when I read The Deathly Hallows.



There are no words to describe how much I love Harry Potter, and how much I want to smack my 14-year-old for obsessing over a controlling, douchebag vampire when I could have been laughing and swooning at Fred and George Weasley's antics.



I am not part of the Potter generation. But I wish I had been."
48,49,5,"Beyond amazing! Way to start the new year! :)

I've read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone way back in High School but I wasn't able to finish it because sad to say, my book was lost. :( And now, thanks to my lovely friend Allie who gave me a copy of this book, I became interested to read it once again and bring back the old times' feels.

And WOW! Just WOW! Thank goodness I decided to read it again because it felt so magical and magnificent and totally breathtaking! -- exactly what I've felt the first time I've read this.



is such a great, well-fleshed out character. Despite being parentless and being bullied both in the Muggle world and Hogwarts by some kids, he still stood up and even became a great friend to , , , and the others.

This story had lots of exciting adventures and I really enjoyed everything that happened in this book. It was just so awesome! The secondary characters are also perfect. I especially love Hermione and her genius mind! Ron's loyalty towards Harry is also awe-inspiring, as well as Neville's adorable clumsiness. When it comes to its plotline, it's amazingly done. The twist was unpredictable and there was humor in every page that made me laugh. What's even great are the lessons and the message that are instilled to every reader, fantasy and magic aside.



I loved all the chapters and my favorites are:

, and .

No wonder why this book and the whole series continues to be a real sensation. is so brilliant she bewitched me with her world! So excited to find out more about this series and to see what's in store for Harry in the next books. :)

49,50,5,"“I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed - or worse, expelled. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.”



I haven't read JK Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone since reading it aloud to my son about 15 years ago (probably with the Sorcerer's Stone title). Reading it was like walking down Memory Lane. So nostalgic. Reliving Harry Potter's adventures was such a fun experience! That is all!"

51,52,5,"This is one of the ten bestselling books ever. How do I approach this book to review? It set the ball rolling for so many of us. The book was set in the 90's, and I'm almost the same age as Harry would be.

For some time, it would be so tempting to pretend that magic exists. J.K Rowling's seal on this type of mysterious novel has never been attempted before. The book has many influences, but in the end, it stands alone.

Did I broach on how fun it was to read these books? This reread is the first since joining Goodreads. Loved it, and most characters are so funny, including the backfiring handed to Malfoy.

It's been a privilege to read book 1 of the series. I know how it will end, but let me enjoy book 2 in quiet. Book 7 made me cry but the joy of books 1-3 is unrivaled. We will never see it matched in the future. Not until decades and maybe a couple of centuries later.

I tried to find special ideas to show my love for these books, but I can't do it justice. Let's leave out the cold word bildungsroman until later."

I tried out the audiobook (narrated by Stephen Fry) finally... and I loved it so so much. He does an incredible job bringing the story to life and his voices for every character are spot on in my opinion. Loved it 😭❤️️"
53,54,5,"This is such a hugely popular series that my review is probably not necessary, but I feel compelled to at least note how immensely important and impactful this book can be.

Forget about the need for fantastic children’s literature. Ignore the movies. Don’t even consider the amount of money and product built from the empire of Harry Potter. Think purely about the imagination an author created not only with this first book but the entire series.

A child who feels lost and alone. A world of magic where you still struggle. A history of good and evil. A school divided amongst houses. A land of muggles and one of witches. Imagination runs wild and with absolute infinite options.

Intepretation on themes and imagery cannot be any greater. Connections of every sort can be made to so many other genres of literature, periods in history. This book is so much more than a story. It’s created a world where anyone, child or adult, can be who they want to be without any concern or shame.

And for those reasons alone, it’s in my favorite books of all time."
54,55,5,
55,56,5,"I knew I couldn’t go wrong if I picked up this gem!
I’ve literally owned this book since it came out in the 90s and I FINALLY have gotten around to reading it and I’m so happy I made the time to. I heard from someone that between the Halloween season and Christmas season is the best time to read the HP series so after being in a months long reading slump I figured it was worth a try especially right now.
Of course I’ve seen the first movie a million times (the others movies-less and less as they go on), but I didn’t feel I enjoyed this less already knowing how things play out. There’s plenty of scenes that are different from the movie so it was unique material and the writing is so descriptive that reading about the delicious feast or the battle or the quidditch game can make you feel as though you’re there instead of watching it on the screen. The joy of reading is the places it can take you-real or imaginary.
I loved it. I will immediately be starting book two asap."

Favorite moments/quotes from this book (spoiler warning in case you haven't got a chance to pick up this book yet):

""Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid""

""Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left 'to hide that horrible scar.'""

""...he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney.""

""...Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.""

""The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.
'What's this?' he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared ask a question.
'Your new school uniform,' she said.
'Oh,' he said, 'I didn't realize it had to be so wet.'""

""Twenty four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window.""

""Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.""

""' ,' chorused the twins.
'Oh, him,' said Harry. 'I mean, yes, I am.'""

""'Oh, are you a , Percy?' said one of the twins with an air of great surprise. 'You should have said something, we had no idea.'
'Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,' said the other twin. 'Once -""
'Or twice-'
'A minute-'
'All summer-'""

""'If I get one more owl telling me you've - you've blown up a toilet or-'
'Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.'
'Great idea though, thanks, Mom.'""

""...their younger sister began to cry.
'Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls.'
'We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.'""

""'How exactly do they sort us into house?' he asked Ron.
'Some sort of text, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.'""

""Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!""

""Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased""

""'Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?'
Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cance she was going to use on him?""

""...never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.""

""But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.""

""...the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.""

""'Send him off, red! Red card!'
'What are you talking about, Dean?' said Ron.
'Red card! said Dean. 'In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game.'
'But this isn't soccer, Dean'""

""...the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban.""

""'And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,' said Ron. 'It'd be safe to ask them.'
'Very safe, as they're both dentists'""

""I supposed she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid - we know we're called Gred and Forge.""

""They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.""

""I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.""

""Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.""

""'You're worth twelve of Malfoy,' Harry said. 'The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.'""

""And I gave Mmalfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle singled-handed!""

""Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk.""

""The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were ticling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.""

""'So light a fire!' Harry choked.
'Yes - of course - but there's no wood!' Hermione cried, wringing her hands.
'HAVE YOU GONE MAD?' Ron bellowed. 'ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?'""

"" ""

""Books! And cleverness! There are more important things - friendship and bravery""

""I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.""

""After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.""

""Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.""

""'The truth,' Dumbledore sighed. 'It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.'""

""If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark.""

""It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.""

And since I'm trying to be transparent about problematic content in books, especially in books that I enjoy, this book has a problem with fatphobia. The way that fat people are described is awful and people's weight often become the butt of jokes."
57,58,5,¿Cuántas veces he releído la saga de Harry Potter? Hace muchos años que perdí la cuenta...
58,59,5,"¡La de veces que yo he releído Harry Potter y me sigue gustando tanto como la primera vez! Ahora, el haber releído el libro en inglés, cosa que nunca había hecho, y en su versión ilustrada me tiene alucinando, de verdad. Cosas tan pequeñas como los acentos de los personajes y algunas palabras escritas en su versión británica y no americana me enamoraron <3.

Sigo pensando que nunca es tarde para leer Harry Potter, o incluso para releerlo. Esta historia me trajo muchísimos recuerdos de la época en la que me sabía el nombre de cada capítulo, de cada personaje y de cada punto y cada coma que aparecía en sus páginas... Recordé cómo esperábamos súper impacientes cada nuevo libro, cada película, porque queríamos saber más de las aventuras de Harry, queríamos volver a ese mundo mágico lejos de los Muggles, queríamos volver a Hogwarts.

Releyendo este libro entiendo por qué Harry logró crearse un espacio en mi corazón y por qué nunca se va a ir de allí tenga la edad que tenga."

This was a reread for me (obviously) and it was so heartwarming and perfect. Rereading Harry Potter is like coming home. I listened to it on audio because Jim Dale is bae. Seriously, his Hagrid voice is my life.



Growing up I always had a love/hate relationship with Harry as the main character, but this time around I just loved the lil guy. Maybe it's because of all the tumblr headcanon I've read, but I honestly cried when he opened his Christmas presents and when he went to see his parents in the mirror every night. (tbh everything about this book made me emotional.)



This reread also made me realize how many serious topics HP touches on: bullying, making friends, loss, love, etc."
61,62,5,"Of course….Five Glorious stars …duh! And I am so jealous of all the kids who get to grow up reading these awesome illustrated versions.



Absolutely gorgeous illustrations by Jim Kay that takes the Potter experience to a whole new level !



I don’t remember when was the first time I read it…no idea why I gave it 4 stars then! I love…love…love… the Potter movies and have watched them countless times. Hopefully ,I’ll be finishing the series..finally this year..:D


Honestly, the plot is pretty straight forward but nothing can beat the genius storytelling and the magical world building.There is no point in rambling about it anymore …I think every single person here must have read it at least once….and even those who have not read it..know most of the story :) .And if by any chance, you do not belong to either of these categories...OMG ...you have no freaking idea how much I envy you right now…Can you please swap your pristine brain with my potter – infested one ??!!

Finally, a big thanks to my ‘Tabaahi’ gang for making the BR such a memorable one!






Ummm...apologies for my disappearance midway :D…. Not my fault…I swear someone performed a vanishing spell !! :P"
62,63,5,"This series is Beauty Beauty Beauty! :D

I was introduced to this volume and Harry when I was 8. I remember my sister used to read it to me and fast forward to today, I read this series to her kids. :)

The book starts off by introducing the wizarding world from the vantage point of the Dursley’s who we later find out are the Aunt and Uncle of Harry Potter, a boy whose parents were murdered while he managed to survive. The attack on Harry’s parents left a signature lightning bolt scar on his forehead.

رغم إن البداية كانت غير كدا خالص
جوان رولنج المؤلفة لفت تقريبا على كل دور النشر و ""حفيت"" عشان حد ينشرلها الرواية
كان سبب الرفض من وجهة نظر دور النشر هو إنها دون المستوى وإنها مجرد حكاية للأطفال

خصوصاً بعد ما كانت السبب في إن الكاتبة تصبح بعد صدور الجزء الرابع بقليل أول شخص توصل ثروته للمليار دولار من مهنة الكتابة.


والرواية حقيقي مش بس شهرة
الرواية دي عظيمة جدًا جداً
الرواية دي هي اللي أعادت الروح لحكايات السحرة من تاني
وهي مش مجرد رواية عن السحر زي ما نص أفلام هوليود في السبعينيات مجرد أفلام عن مسدسات بتعرف تضرب نار

وأحيانا مش بتبقى فلسفية أوي
لكن هي وسيلة كويسة لتعليم الأطفال والكبار وزرع قيم جواهم
واللي هحاول أناقش بعضها في كل جزء

من القيم المحورية هنا

65,66,5,"I wish this book had come out when I was young, I wish that someone had convinced me to read them when they first came out, and I wish I had read this series before I watched the movies...I wish..I wish..I wish...

I wish I wasn't a Muggle.



The day started off the same as any other day for Vernon Dursley- he picked out his clothes for work, got dressed, listened to his wife- Petunia- as she struggled with their son -Dudley- during one of his tantrums, grabbed his briefcase, kissed them both good-bye, got into his car and drove away from number four Privet drive. That is where the day took a strange turn...Vernon just chose to ignore it.





He ignored the cat reading a map on the street corner outside his home. He ignored the people dressed in cloaks...He ignored the owls flying outside his window at work- and after some careful consideration, he decided to also ignore the whispers on the streets outside at lunch- mentioning the name Harry Potter, and the strange man that hugged him for no reason...If Vernon had been a different sort of man- he would have known life was about to change for his ""happy' little family.





The street lights on Privet drive flicker off one by one- and a group of four gather just outside the Dursley residence. Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hargrid, set baby Harry and a letter on the doorstep. For Harry Potter isn't just any child and must be kept safe. One day he will know who he is, and one day they will come back for him.





First off I would like to thank my friend Stepheny- for finally being the one to give me that extra push I needed to give in and read this wonderful book- and I do mean PUSH. She was relentless, and now I know why! Anything I say will pale in comparison to her review of HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE- so I am going to link her review and let her words take over from here...



Thanks Stepheny! :D"

FINALLY! I got to read the book with my daughter. In fact, she read a good large portion of it, herself. I'm proud of her. But honestly, I'm just happy and relieved that my girl likes magic.

Of course, she got to watch her daddy cry every time Neville did things and wonder WTF he had to stop to wipe away the tears.

It's a thing.

Oh, and she liked the book. It's good to know I don't have to trade her in for a functional daughter. :)


Original Review:

Harry Potter Re-Read with Buddies!

I think everyone knows the story. And pretty much everyone enjoys the kids, the adults, and the darkness of the tale.

I came late to enjoying it, turned off by the childish bookcover and my love of all things adult and nuanced, but I did come around to it. What really surprised me was the quality of the writing and the effortless nuance displayed AS IF it wasn't even a children's book. It didn't talk down or give platitudes. It just threw the kids in danger. (Or Dumbledore did. Again.) And let the world sort itself or not. Could we be seeing a version of survival of the fittest?

Okay, Harry. Here's your invisibility cloak. Go get into as much trouble as you can and I'll be sure to lead enough hints to get you into the worst of messes and lead you right to the person that killed your parents and who was barely unable to do the same to you. Have Fun!

Wait a second. This is a kid's book, right? It does happen to have a lot of the trappings. But what kind of sentiment is this? Let's throw the kids in the worst of dangers, shall we? Just turn a slightly blind eye. Put incompetents in charge of extremely powerful magical items and secrets. Hell, why not give eleven-year-olds the cruciatas curse? Sheesh. This school should get put under scrutiny by M.O.M.

And yet none of that mars my enjoyment. :) I like dark stuff. The fact that it has a somewhat happy ending despite knowing you know who is still out there is just icing on the cake.

Yeah. I'm a fanboy. I may not be a crazy potterhead, but I'll be honest. I've watched the movies like a gazillion times. :) There's just a spark of greatness, you know?"

After not having read this series for years, I forgot how much I loved this world and JK Rowling's writing style as a whole!

72,73,5,always good for a comfort read.
73,74,5,the magic will never die
74,75,5,"Rambling and Raving:
Harry Potter will always be that series for me. The novel that takes my mind off the present, off scalding fears and worries, off anxiety or anything coming in the near future. It's a series I can return that feels a little bit like home, one that feels as familiar as if I've walked these halls hundreds of times with Harry, Ron, and Hermione, sneaking through empty trophy rooms with magical mirrors, hiding under an invisibility cloak.

Anything could be on my mind — anything at all — and Harry Potter will whisk me off to a foreign land where I don't have to worry about my own troubles. I think that's why we read: to get our mind off the panic, the pain, our trembling, aching fear of reality. Instead of having to face those things, I can pretend. I can think about how to stop Voldemort from getting the Stone. I can think about how to get through the trapdoor beneath Fluffy's paws. I can think about how the hell I'm going to get ride of Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback. And it doesn't matter that I've read these books six times — I'll never grow tired of them, and each time I reread them, I know I'll have grown somewhat closer to the characters and the world than last time, and that's all I could ever hope for.



J.K. Rowling's new reputation has of course bothered me, but in all seriousness, I'm not here to talk about the author; I'm here to talk about the book. Usually if I don't agree with an author's actions/thoughts/beliefs outside of their works, then I don't support them. But Harry Potter is different, because it was one of the first series that got into reading fantasy in the first place, and I won't let Rowling ruin that for me. I'm not disregarding anything she's said or done about transgender or anyone else; I'm simply stating that I choose my thoughts and my battles, and will therefore not allow her to take away the pleasure from reading a truly amazing series.

Now, I refuse to use up anymore of my review talking about her. I never thought I'd actually write a coherent review for Harry Potter because it's a series that almost everyone has read and that everyone has heard about, but I decided to anyway because I felt like it.



I like Harry and Ron, but Hermione Granger will always be my favorite. Hermione is an extremely bold character, which is why it doesn't surprise me that she got chosen for Gryffindor instead of Ravenclaw. Her character arc is by far the best out of the trio's, because she grows from an intelligent, timid girl into one that raises her chin when faced with a challenge. She punches Malfoy, stands up to Snape, helps protect the entire school from both ignorance and danger, and boldly makes the decision that it was more important to stop Voldemort than it was to follow the rules. That education was important, and that ignorance was dangerous.

The thing I love most about Hermione is that she was born and raised in a Muggle household, and she's a Muggle herself, yet she still manages to be the best witch in her year over all the other half-bloods and full-bloods. She teaches young readers that ""fighting like a girl"" is a , is good thing, not something to be laughed at or looked down upon. Hermione's character has always motivated me to be both a better person and a better student; she had a goal in mind and she followed through with it. She taught me that you can be anything you want if you put your absolute hardest work. She was one of my very first role models, and Emma Watson isn't much different.



Hogwarts is one of my favorite worlds to visit because it's a place where everything is just so from the real world: you have your own shops like Madame Malkin's Dress Robes for All Occasions, newspapers like or . You have only one sport called Quidditch with four balls. You have characters with names like Didalus Diggle and Albus Dumbledore, seemingly the weirdest names ever, but that somehow feels completely natural in this world. Rowling takes the most bizarre aspects of the world and turns them into everyday, normal, realistic things, and that's what I love most about Harry Potter. The wizarding world allows the reader a true sense of , to fall between the words on the pages and to forget their very existence...allowing them to let go of who they were and to become someone else for a little while. And maybe that makes us all a little bit like imposters, trying desperately to fit into new skin with every book we read, but I think that's the most beautiful thing about being a reader. You're never only yourself — there are underneath your skin, so many people you've been, so many things you've seen, so many places you've been, that it's difficult to remain the same person. I wonder why we even come back to the real world at all.



I've always loved the unpredictability of Rowling's plots, especially 's. What makes the plot especially enticing is the constant and dropping of hints throughout the first half and middle of the novel. The series as a whole gets very interesting because of all the mysteries just waiting to be uncovered in the rest of the books.



Overall, Harry Potter is a world I'm extremely grateful for; without it, my middle school years probably would have sucked more. It's an adventure the moment you pick up these books, the moment the precious words sink onto your tongue and you taste and you feel them. This was the first world I read about where I realized I could be a reader in a true sense; I remember being so relieved I had found a place where I was understood and where I could just , where I could sink into words like a warm bath and return home again.

Putting aside the qualms I have of Rowling, I know I'll always return to these books in any great times of need; times that I wish to return to a childhood long misplaced, or to return to a world that still holds the child part of me inside of it, that twelve-year-old girl who believed she'd still get her Hogwarts letter even if she had discovered the magical world a year too late."
75,76,5,"Wizardry
It’s very difficult to say anything unique about the most successful book series in history. The Harry Potter series by JK Rowling is momentous, captivating, obsessive, magical and intelligently written. The array of characters have become household names and our appetite for magic, good versus evil, humour, friendships and action-packed thrills, is excellently accommodated in these books.

I have watched the films multiple times but not read the books until now. I come from a fanatical HP family where my wife and children have been pressing me for years to read the books, telling me I will learn so much more of the Harry Potter world – I finally gave in – damn my stubbornness.

Something deeply affects lovers of Harry Potter in that they want to relate themselves to Hogwarts' houses such that the Sorting Hat is applying itself to the public. Oh, I’m Hufflepuff, I’m Ravenclaw – just look at social media account bios. The characters represent the various individual personality traits rather than treating each character with challenging layers of attributes. This is expected with a young adult theme but means we read the stories for the adventure.

As the first book in the series, , (also known as for US audiences), establishes the main characters, background, friendships, particularly between Harry, Hermione, Ron and Hagrid, and the subtly laid plot fragments that will play a part as the story develops over the 7 books. This is where J.K. Rowling excels in her ability to weave segments of the plots and subplots into a narrative that is enthralling and highly imaginative. Take what seems to be simple dialogue during the sorting hat scene.
For those that know the full story there is a subtle puzzle piece presented in that decision making, and the intrigue develops.

The connections and twists are superbly structured and as we know that Harry is THE ONE Voldemort couldn’t kill, which gives Harry his fame and notoriety. The connection between the two is established in this book and runs deeper than first expected.



In the lead up to Harry becoming a Quidditch player, he demonstrates his bravery and willingness to stand up for injustice and against bullying. These attributes along with those from Hermione, Ron and the overseeing Dumbledore will be crucial in the battle against the evil wizard. Dumbledore is headmaster of Hogwarts and is famous for defeating Grindelwald (another plot fragment planted) and for his work with his partner Nicolas Flamel in making the Philosopher’s Stone. The Philosopher’s Stone is a substance that can transform any metal into gold and produces the Elixir of Life. Who might want that??

The Harry Potter books are extensively filled with creatures and monsters that come from myths and legends from many sources and Rowling weaves them imperceptibly into her own tale of magic, fantasy and supernatural adventure. Part of her genius is to show rather than tell, to build the landscape in our imagination, and to leave the muggles world so tantalisingly close, it is so intelligently done that we're just immersed in her magical world.

I would highly recommend this book and series, and whether it’s one of your favourite genres or not, it deserves to be read by everyone. It wouldn’t be my favourite but delighted to have read it and satiated that nagging voice in my mind (and elsewhere :))."
76,77,5,"I was in eighth grade when my mom brought me home a paperback copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. I immediately gave her the most outraged look possible and couldn’t believe that she would be handing me something as ridiculous as Harry Potter. “But Mom!” I said, “I read Stephen King. This book is for kids!” Well, if there is one thing my mom knows, it is her children. So she said back to me: “Stepheny, they are talking about banning this book from the schools.” Well, that was all it took. She knew me well enough and knew my feelings on book-banning. I waited until she walked out of the room before cautiously picking the book up, not wanting to give her the satisfaction of knowing she hit the right button. I skimmed the back cover and had an internal conflict as to whether or not I was actually going to read Harry Potter. Sure, people were talking about this book everywhere, but come on…it’s a ! After a few minutes of going back and forth inside my own head I decided I would at the very least give it a shot. I mean, why not, right? I told myself that if I didn’t like it I could put it down and move on with my life.

I finished that book that same day. I picked it up, became so immersed that I couldn’t put it down and it was over before I knew what had just happened. Later that evening, I asked my mom if she could pick me up the other 2 books of the series that were already out. When she gave me the next two I finished those and had to wait for a whole year before I could get my hands on the fourth one… I was hooked.

There is a reason that I encourage people to read this series. It is life-changing. For me anyway. I would re-read the first books before the new one was coming out, would wait in the endless lines at midnight to get my copy, and stay up the rest of the night reading until my eyes forced themselves shut against my insistence that they stay open. I am a part of the Harry Potter generation, even if I got a late start. I have continued the tradition of re-reading the series every year and I am telling you- it never gets old. In fact, it makes me feel young again. It takes me back to my young, carefree days when life was easy and made sense. I read this series because I love every word of it. The characters are unforgettable, the storyline is an adventure and the series itself is perfection.

This book has seen me through my worst days. It saw me through my awkward teenage years, my insecure post-high school years and the uncomfortable years where you are trying to define who you are and where you stand in the world. And when my father was first diagnosed with cancer, I turned to this book to help me out. It has never once let me down.

I tell people to read the first few books to get a feel for the story, but know they are definitely children’s books. (That, by no means, lowers the level of enjoyment.) But as the story progresses, the storyline matures, as do the characters. I see a piece of myself in nearly every character and I think that is what helps make Harry Potter such an incredible experience. Even if the situations are a little extreme, you can relate to the characters. The world is so real, you just it actually exists and that JKR has been granted access-which is why she was able to write about it- DUH!

I am thankful I was able to convince my GR buddy, Delee, to pick these books up, and even more thrilled that she loved it. So far, every person I have persuaded has enjoyed the books, and that is an incredible feat- if not only for the reason that every person I have persuaded has had very different tastes in books. These books are truly something special. With as many times as I have read these books, this is the first time I have tried to write a review. (How do you even write a review for HP?!)

I guess I can sum it up with this: I will continue to re-read these books until I am dead and hope to one day share it with the children I don’t have yet. This is more than just a book-it is a part of who I am."
77,78,5,There is really no way to do this book justice. I felt years younger in spirit just from reading it. This is all.
78,79,5,"""This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world that won't know his name. There will be books about him, he will be a legend.""

In hindsight, it just strikes me just how prophetic these words from the first book turned out to be. I don’t think anyone, including Rowling herself, realized at the times just how much these books would come to define a whole entire generation of people, including me. When the books first came out, I was obsessed with all things Harry Potter. I have newspaper clippings, letters I wrote to Rowling, her autograph, and so much more HP memorabilia. I used to religiously re-read the whole series every summer up until life took over a few years back. So it’s a really nostalgic feeling returning to this series now after the original books and movies are done and to see this world that I love through the eyes of an adult. I’m glad to say I still love this series as much, if not more, this time around.

As I'm sure by now everyone and their mother either have already read these books, or knows about them, I’m going to skip over why you would read this book and talk instead about what I love about it. So here it is:


(In no particular order)

--The sheer magic of Harry Potter. And I don't just mean the magical world of Harry Potter, but the writing style. J.k. Rowling, for all her faults and controversies, puts magic into words in the way that she writes her stories. I’ve mentioned this several times before, but she has a way of making even the most mundane of things sound extraordinary. Rowling’s writing is at its raw, most humble form here and it works really well to draw you into the story.

---Hagrid giving Harry his first-ever Birthday cake and his first ever-present. Harry turning utterly speechless at receiving something for the first time in his life.

---The Weasleys. I adore every single member of the Weasley family, including pompous Percy. They just have this way of making Harry feel at home for the first time in his entire life. It’s the family he’s always wanted and needed.

---Ms. Weasley, in particular, deserves her own little spot. I just love his woman! She’s such a mother hen taking Harry in and feeding him. Sending him a family jumper on Christmas because she knows he has no one else to send him anything. And I just 😭 I have a LOT of feelings about Mrs. Weasley okay.

---Ron being Harry’s first friend at Hogwarts. Ron giving Harry presents for Christmas and telling his family to get him something as well since he knows Harry won’t get anything. Ron always patiently explaining the rules of the Wizarding world to Harry. Ron immediately ready to go risk his life with Harry Ron just being the bestest friend ever! He doesn’t get enough credit for how sweet he is.

---Harry being 100 James in almost everything that he does. How this boy survived all those years with the Dursleys without unleashing his pure chaotic energy is a mystery to me. I like to think James is looking at him from heaven and absolutely beaming with pride when he gets t be the youngest seeker in a century!

---Hermoine loving books and reading and being the smartest witch of her time. Hermoine being a know it all but not quite knowing how to make friends. Hermione breaking rules and lying for her first-ever friends at Hogwarts. She’s a sweetheart.

---The Mirror of Erised. Just everything about this scene is the coolest! The backward writing. The way it reveals so much character depth while also adding to the plot for years to come! The fact that this is the first real glimpse of his family that Harry gets. The little chat with Dumbledore, who I realize now probably was in the room that first night because he wanted to see Ariana.

---Playing Quidditch with the OG team! I fucking love Oliver Wood! One of my absolute favorite characters, every line with Wood is absolute gold and I love him! Also, the whole scene where Harry does a 50-foot dive and gets the remembrall on his first time on a broom??? ABSOLUTELY LEGENDARY!

---The way Rowling names people hinting at their occupations:
by Arsenius Jigger
and Fungi by Phyllida Spore

---The fact that Nicolas Flamel was 665 years old and died right before he could reach 666 😂

---The fact that Harry always puts himself in danger first before he lets his friends follow behind only once it's safe. He is also just 11??? My sweet boy deserves the world honestly.

---

😂😂😂
This scene always cracks me up! It also reveals so much about their characters. Harry always keeps his cool in times of danger. Hermoine is a mess in a crisis, especially in these earlier books she does get better later but is the best at practical magic. Ron, being from a wizarding family, never forgets there’s always a magical solution to every problem. He also is the only one with common sense sometimes.

---The whole concept of Wizard Chess and the fact that Ron is a brilliant chess player! And also the fact that he, at 11, decided that the best way to move forward was to sacrifice himself for the greater good. He doesn’t get nearly enough credit for being such an integral part of the trio.

---The sleuthing. I just like the trio figuring things out. They get better at it as they grow older, but considering they were 11 in this book? Not bad. Not bad at all.

---The fact that these idiots figure everything out and go to fight Voldemort by themselves at 11!!!

---The fact that Dumbledore was probably testing harry this whole time. I repeat, he was 11!!!

---Harry keeping the truth from the Dursleys that he’s not allowed to use magic outside the school.

There’s a lot more of course. The Harry Potter books are my whole childhood. It fostered my love for fantasy books and reading in general. These books are one of the reasons I’m an English major today. I still identify myself as a Gryffindor. There is just no outgrowing something that forms such an integral part of your life and identity.

All this is to say that this is obviously a very biased rating. Objectively speaking, this first book is probably worth about . This first book is by no means perfect, even in comparison to the later books in the series. But I rate books according to how much I enjoy them and this one is a classic true favorite. No matter where I am in my book slump I can always count on reading The Philosopher’s Stone to get me back into the magic of reading. And that's worth all the stars in my book.

------------------------------------------------
No matter when I pick up this series or how many years have passed, the magic remains the same. Reading this is like coming home. I don't think I'll ever get tired of going back and revisiting these characters and these places. *happy sigh*"

Now you will be like, Megha how many times are you gonna read the same book? Well, as many times as I wish!! Honestly I think I need to read it couple of more times to make up for the years I've lost by not reading it sooner.

Listened to audiobook narrated by Jim Dale. It was so amazing! I'm gonna make my way through all audiobooks now. So magical 🦄

6/11/17

Still just as magical and fantastical as ever.

7/12/16

Why have I not read Harry Potter before now, it’s totally amazing! From the first page till the last one I was hooked. I always thought I wouldn’t enjoy a book about a wizard boy who is 11…but damn I was so wrong! Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are probably the best characters ever. They are smart, loyal, brave, funny, and so much more; you can’t help but love them. Honestly, I can’t wait till I get started with the rest of the series."
81,82,5,"Was in the mood for something lighter and since I had recently acquired a beautiful collection of audiobooks for the Harry Potter series, I decided to listen to the first installment in the series again. Caught many details which had escaped me before, and enjoyed the experience of delving into this world once again immensely.

Still a staple of young-adult fantasy so many years after its release, and an enduring classic. It's difficult to think of anything else that had such a significant and shaping impact on the generation which grew up with it.


* * *


It’s time for a little confession: I have survived years without having read any Harry Potter book or having watched any Harry Potter movie. I remember seeing glimpses of the third or fourth movie in my childhood on a friend’s birthday, but that’s about everything which connected me with the world of Harry Potter. More recently, a friend of mine forced me to finally watch the movies, not understanding how I could still have had a relatively enjoyable childhood without the presence of Harry Potter in it. So here I am, having read the first book approximately ten years too late, and regretting to never have read it before.

The novel actually has a lot of flaws which I could start to criticize right now. But apart from the assumption that it would gain me some enemies, what would be the point of it? This book is exactly the way it has been written. Even its flaws made me laugh or at least chuckle, and during every other page of the book, I wanted to be a part of Hogwarts. I always thought of the HP series as being set in a world designed for children, but now I understand how wrong my thinking was. Furthermore, I can’t stop comparing it to the Chronicles of Narnia, which are set in another magical world – yet the writing seems so much more childish. Rowling’s style addresses children, teens and adults alike, and that’s what I admire most about her writing.

I’m only 57 days older than the first book of the Harry Potter series as of its publication date, yet it has needed 6746 days before I finally entered the world of Hogwarts along with Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom and all the other well-known characters connected with the series, and two more days before I finished the first year in Hogwarts. The only possible way for me to make good for avoiding Rowling’s book for such a long time is to read all the six following novels. Soon.

And to await the arrival of my own Hogwarts letter."
82,83,5,"Rereading Harry Potter always feels like coming home. It was so nice to start at the beginning with Harry before he knew he was a wizard. The wonder and amazement he felt as he arrived at Hogwarts. The friendship that formed among Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Also seeing the little things when I know now how everything ends and ties together. It's just the coziest, most beautiful feeling to be back at Hogwarts and I cannot wait to continue my reread of the series.

83,84,5,I swear every time I read this book I fall even more in love with it!
84,85,5,"Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.




Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book of my life. I can remember when I was six and walked by a bookstore. Firstly, I didn't see it and then I rechecked the store again, that made me see this book sat on the self in the center of this store. I hadn't known anything about Harry Potter since then, all I know was it had a beautiful cover. So why didn't I give a try ?



The first paragraph of this book is like magic. How can't you fall in love with the book narrated like a bedtime story and there's magic in it ? Frankly, I fall HARD for this book. It's my first love and the only one I can't forget. Harry Potter is a boy who lives in the cupboard under the stairs and his life isn't good either. He doesn't know that the letter arrived at his house will change his life forever. The story gradually reveals the secrets under and the world building is solid and intriguing. The magic systen is not complex but it enhances the story very good.





Hogwart is a school that witches and wizards attend to. Harry feels like this is his second home since he first meets Ron and Hermione, his fellows. The journey starts the moment these three find out about the Sorcerer's stone and they think Snape is going to steal it for himself.

I won't say much about the story part because I'm sure eveyone knows it. All I want to say is about the emotional part, I loved how grievous when Harry looks into The Mirror of Erised and he sees his parents. I like the sentence Dumbledore tells him ...



When I was a child, I thought this book was really fun. But when I grow up, this book isn't just a book for me anymore. Harry Potter is an abused boy in his house and he has tolerated all along, no matter what. Harry Potter has a scar, that stands for everyone, we all have our scars and it's up to us to let it restrain your life or let it go and prove ourself not to be the person they think you are. Becoming more and being something bigger than the one those people think you can be.



This book is EVERYTHING. My life. My passion. RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE !

Amo profundamente a Hermione, con todos sus libros y su ánimo para aprender. Y Harry, que les puedo decir, siento un profundo amor por este personaje, un amor muy diferente al que siempre he sentido por los personajes masculinos de los libros.

86,87,5,"So what is Harry Potter and The Philosopher’s Stone?

Good question. But first I ask you, what is magic?

To me, magic is the captivating voice of the imagination, transmutable and quantifiable, it finds its verve in the proper arrangement of words. These words can make you laugh, and cry, and dream dreams that will never die.

It would go without saying that Jo Rowling changed the world when she created Harry Potter, and the result is a deeply meaningful and shareable universe as vast and grand as Star Wars, Final Fantasy, and enrapturing works that have continued to span generations with the perfect combination of action, creativity, and character. As this is my very first reading of Harry Potter and I have never seen the movies (though some things have been spoiled, but not many) I was so happy to treat myself with the release of to the UK Bloomsbury 2010 set that comes in a wonderful red box, and I have two lovely friends to thank for this, Chelsea (Slytherpuff) and Chenda (Slytherin), because without their friendship and enthusiasm, this vast landscape of literary gold would still be void in my life.

Whilst Potter is undeniably English, its likability constitutes some of the very best qualities of Anglophilia (like Christmas pudding and the Hogwarts Express), and reminds us that the stone set in the silver sea has not only some of the greatest writers (male and female) the world has ever seen, but continues to capture our lust for fantastical adventure as a place so heavily steeped in magic, mystery, and muggle-dom, that Potter’s inherent Englishness makes it overly charming and utterly adorable, and, for me, tearfully nostalgic.

The very definition of timeless, not only for its colorful cast of characters (a true ensemble series this is! With someone for everyone to love or hate!) or its prose (lighter than C.S. Lewis’ Narnia but just as enchanting) or its cleverness and conceptualization, Harry Potter finds the precious space in our hearts that we’ve all been endowed, the perfect space to live and dream and desire to be great, to know that destiny is a powerful force at work in our lives, but life is still and adventure full of choices, and the key to truly living is truly the most unexplainably magical idea there is, was, and ever will be, and that is love.

Recommended for everyone!

And get that beautiful red box set whilst you're at it! The covers are <3"
87,88,5,"Es una relectura, pero ¿y qué? El universo de Rowling es tan rico en detalles y está tan lleno de magia que es imposible no enamorarse. No importa cuántas veces lo lea, siempre habrá cosas que me sorprenderán. Leyendo la novela con perspectiva, sabiendo qué ocurrirá en libros venideros, te das cuenta de la cantidad de referencias y pistas que Rowling deja como si nada. PERO ES QUE ESTÁ TODO PENSADO.

Ahora ya en serio, siendo objetivo, es una novela llena de valores, magia y con una historia que nos abre las puertas a un mundo perfectamente explicado y planteado. He de decir que todo lo que se nos presenta (tanto conflictos como magia, leyes o incluso personajes) se hace de un modo bastante plano, pero a la vez, lleno de detalles. Da la sensación de que conocemos el universo y a la gente de éste, pero realmente estamos viendo pequeñas características que se nota que van a ir evolucionando. Y eso es grande, Rowling. Es grande."

So many quotes that I know from the film but are different in the book. I pretty much cried the whole way through reading this just because of nostalgia. Damn that magic!
92,93,5,"Rereading the Harry Potter series on its 25th anniversary. I was told that it’ll add an extra little something when reading these novels during Christmas holiday season. I can only second this opinion as the story is the more mesmerising and the more magical than ever to me this season. I am fully immersed in the plot, the characters fully resonate with me whilst I savour every sentence making this rereading experience as conscious and as everlasting as possible.

The only regret I have is that I hadn’t read this novel when it was first published in 1997. I admit to have missed a lot then that I am eager to catch up on. As I am immersed in a magical world, I am in awe of Rowling‘s outstanding writing that developed mind-sticking characters for a quarter century and more. Whilst Rowling creates a never-seen-before magical world for her readers, she triggers empathy and joy that make the Harry Potter series unforgettable.

In the first installment of this gripping series, Harry discovers that he’s a wizard and attends the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Additionally, the readers are induced to the characters accompanying Harry on his extraordinary journey and the fascinating infrastructure the plot takes place at.

waddup i’m lia i’m 20 and i just read harry potter for the first time in my life! yes, i’m (incredibly) late to the game, but better now than never i guess? in 5th grade, when we went to the library with our class, i had actually started reading the first book and got through maybe three chapters, and i vaguely remembered things while reading this time around even though all that was a whole decade ago (man i feel old).

honestly, i don’t need to write a whole review for this book anyway. i’m assuming you all have read it by now, not gonna lie. BUT!!!! it was my goal to start this series before 2020 and i saved it for christmas and it was the most wholesome read ever. at least i now understand what everyone was on about and i would literally die for the characters i love them so much goddddddd."

Tako me je postepeno osvajao i na kraju doveo do oduševljenja. Završila knjigu ne skidajući osmeh. Hoću joooš :)"
95,96,5,"Just, yes."
96,97,5,"“To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.”

Following the death of his parents at a young age, Harry Potter has grown up under the supervision of the Dursleys (they’re not very nice). However, Harry’s life is turned upside down when Hagrid rocks up and tells him “Yer a wizard, Harry.” All of a sudden he’s on Diagon Alley shopping for a cauldron and a wand (and all the other items on the list), before finding himself on the Hogwarts Express to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Ahhhhh, Harry Potter! The literary equivalent of wrapping yourself in a big, warm blanket on a cold Winter’s day. I had almost forgotten just how magical it really is. And how funny. And how it makes you FEEL things. Harry Potter will live on through the ages, passed from generation to generation, because it’s just timeless and the themes will always be relevant.

Snape is no doubt my favourite character – and if you try to argue with me that you hate Snape, I will cease to acknowledge your existence. No, really. I will. But it’s strange how on rereads different characters will emerge as “new” favourites. It’s not that I ever disliked Neville Longbottom, but on this reread of the first book in the series, I’m appreciating him a lot more. That part at the end had me IN TEARS. And I always loved Hagrid, of course, but I was loving him extra hard this time around.

One of my favourite things about this series is Hermione Granger, and that from the get-go, it is very evident that she’s the real MVP. Harry and Ron are pretty much clueless without her. I too was that nerdy kid (and still am that nerdy adult), and I love that so many children, particularly young girls, will grow up knowing that it’s cool to be smart. And it’s cool to be a book nerd. Hermione is such a great character.

The story in this one might not be the most exhilarating, but’s still pretty exciting! The main aim of this book is to introduce us to the wonderful world of Harry Potter and all the characters found within. Reading the illustrated edition just adds an extra touch of magic! The illustrations are absolutely gorgeous, I was consistently blown away by the magic and beauty captured within these drawings. I wish I could reread the entire series in this format, but alas… we must wait for these yearly releases *cries*

It’s absolutely wonderful to back at Hogwarts and I can’t wait to continue with my reread throughout 2018."
97,98,5,"This series (because I’ve read the whole series) is and will always be one of my favourites!!!I loved everything about it and just the whole plot is amazing. Sometimes books never live up to their hype but with this book, I can actually understand why so many people like it. I can’t even explain my love for this series. I’ve watched the movies so many times and read the books only once which is probably why I'm reading it again. I do have to admit I was really late and read this book only last year. After reading the Cursed Child I just had to read this series again and so I did and I loved it even more!

I read this series around the end of last year but I have a perfectly good explanation for that. Oh and also I may have made the mistake of watching the movies many times before reading the books. I was quite young when I first wanted to read the series. I was maybe 10 years old or younger and because I was a stupid little child that knew nothing about the series I decided to read three of the books out of order. I didn’t realise I had to read them in order and I didn’t even know the order. So anyway it took me around 3 months to finish Goblet of Fire and one month to finish Half-Blood Prince. I mean come on I was young and didn't read as much as I do now. After that I never really cared about the series. Around two years ago I became one of those people that thought Harry Potter was overrated (I’m so sorry guys. I didn’t know why it was so popular) and didn’t think it was that great (I didn’t read that much at the time). Then I watched the movies and loved them and decided to order the first book online. It arrived and I was so excited and then… It was in some random language that I didn’t understand. I didn’t even know what language it was! That was when I gave up on the series until last year where I decided to read the series.

Now after all that unnecessary information on to the actual story. I read this two weeks ago and I can’t remember the small details to do a review so this is going to be a very brief review. Everyone’s probably read this book so I’m not going to say what it's about because that would be unnecessary. Everything about this book is wonderful and the magical world just blew me away. I’m so obsessed that sometimes my sister (who hasn’t read the books was but watched the movies) and I pretend to fight for like one minute and shout out spells at each other. Yeah, I’m really weird.

Now don’t get me wrong I love all the character (the good ones) but someone of the main characters aren't that bright Harry . To be honest I didn’t really think he was that dumb until my friend showed me this thing about why Harry Potter is not in Ravenclaw and it made me realise that he is really an idiot. I would tell you what the reasons are but they spoil the other books so I’m just going to say them when I read the other books. There is one situation where Harry tries to catch the letters in the air and not just pick one of the ground and hide it. They were everywhere so why the hell does he need to grab the ones flying. Yeah, he does manage to get one but he could have got one in a second. Hermione is my favourite character mainly because she’s so smart and without her none of it would have been possible. Harry was so stupid and don’t get me started on Ron. Hermione was amazing she was the one that was able to figure everything out.

This series will always be a series that I will never get sick of. I read this book so quickly. I flew through it and didn’t even realise it. Everything about is is just perfect and if you’re someone who doesn't read this is the best book to get you into it. Even though this is my second time reading it and I know everything that happens it still is just as good. Also, do not be deceived, this book is not for children only."

After slogging through the 663 pages of bleakness that was The Dragon Republic, rereading this was like being wrapped in a warm blanket and handed a mug of hot chocolate with little marshmallows floating in it.

But I still have a lot of questions about the wizarding world, Joanne.

(Also, I know it's the 90s but has NO ONE heard of child safety in the wizarding world?!?!)

I continue to worry about the education of children in the wizarding world. Like...can you just finish your NEWTs and immediately become a teacher at Hogwarts? Why do y'all measure assignments in feet and inches when someone could just write in giant letters to fill up the space? And how the hell does anyone understand the wizarding financial system when a) there are 29 knuts in a sickle and 17 sickles in a galleon and b) no one learns maths??? Don't get me wrong, I will continue to love this until the day I die. I just have a lot of questions, Joanne.

As someone who works in a school, there are no words for how much I hate Severus Snape. Like...BRO. You're 32 years old. And you're holding an uber-grudge against an 11 year old that you've never met? GROW THE FUCK UP. YOU'RE A TERRIBLE TEACHER. GET OUT.

Unrelated: it cracks me up that they're all losing, like, one house point here and in the later books, the teachers are all ""I'M TAKING A THOUSAND POINTS FOR YOUR SASS"". Here, it's the end of the world when they lose five points. El. Oh. El.

I have so many feelings about Harry Potter: abused child.

It staggers me that no matter how many times I read these books, I still find new things every time. Surely, after sixteen rereads, I shouldn't be surprised by anything? And yet, I am. This time around? Harry's nerves about being Sorted: ""He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue.""

I first read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone on a plane from London to Singapore in 1998. My mum handed it and Chamber of Secrets to me as I was boarding the plane, and told me to read them and let me know what she thought when she got back to Australia the following week. I read both books straight through without stopping. I read through dinner, and I kept reading when they dimmed the lights so everyone could go to sleep.

Fourteen years later, it still has the same power over me. I love every second of it. It may not be a perfect book from a critical point of view. But to me, as a reader? It's flawless."
101,102,5,"5 stars!!

A man with half moon spectacles, a woman with a pointy hat and a huge beefy man leaving, a small baby boy with a scar on his forehead on the doorstep of a Muggle house, where he worked like a servant for 11 years until the huge, beefy man sweep him away to a new world claiming he was a WIZARD!
He then faces a whole new world filled with owls and broomsticks, moving stairs, talking portraits, nearly headless ghosts, singing hats, remember balls, spooky rooms, mirrors that reveal your deepest desires of your heart, three headed dogs, spells and mysteries, where he is soon going to learn about friendship, loyalty, bravery and most of all love.



Loved this soo much!! This has been my literal childhood and my comfort book and even after 10 years later this is the book that I never get tired of reading!

The first sentence was all it took and I was already falling inside the pages of this book. The way it began was amazing. It was unusual, magical and at first, it didn’t make sense to me at all. The whole first chapter was filled with mysteries and odd incidents. I loved the fact J.K didn’t give up all the secrets in one go. She kept some tit-bits for herself and allowed the reader to imagine and get curious on what’s going to happen next.

She built up all these amazing characters with flaws and yet managed make them look perfect. She also gave each character, from the main character to the minor, their own story which made the story even more interesting to read. She even made sure to pick out names that match the character’s personality. Each of them played different roles throughout the story and none were left out. And each one managed to take a special place in my heart. All the twists and turns and flashbacks from the past it all got me. All I can say is that whatever it may be I am so glad I was able to gobble up this lovely treasure, for after many years later from my childhood to my adulthood this beautiful thing manages to make me giggle and giddy like a 5 year old!

(Hagrid's hut)

it took me a few years to get my hands on these beautiful additions, they're quite a bit of money and I couldn't quite justify it until last year—but boy, were they worth it. Harry Potter is unlike any other book I've ever read, my Dad began reading this series to me when I was little, too young to probably even fully understand the story.

Somewhere around the age of fourteen began my tradition of rereading the series at Christmas (and only Christmas), once every year. This year was even more special than usual, it was like I was reading this magical series again for the first time, and this time I savoured it. The illustrations done by Jim Kay were enchanting and wonderful, seeing these characters almost reimagined made me somewhat teary eyed.













My personal favourites were all the character portraits, I loved the beautiful and distinctive way Kay drew these beloved characters. Pretty chuffed to add these to my already expansive Harry Potter collection.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book of the Harry Potter series and is written by J.K. Rowling




is about Harry Potter - who lives in a tiny closet beneath the stairs of the nasty Dursley family, and he hasn't celebrated his birthday in ten years.

His life has been miserable until a mysterious letter arrives by an owl messenger. A letter with an invitation to a place called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports and magic, but a great destiny that has been waiting for him.


Let's move on to what I liked and disliked about , shall we?


💙
What I really liked about Harry Potter, as a character, is that he gets discovered love and friendship ever since Hagrid appeared at the cabin. When Harry lived with the Dursley family for , I felt pity for him because he didn't receive any love from them and they treated him badly. Not only that, they even discriminated him as well! I’m just happy for him that he has made new friends, including Ron and Hermione, and is having a great time in Hogwarts.

What I also liked about Harry Potter is that he’s a humble character even though he’s famous. And brave and selfless too, which is a big thumbs up! 😊👍



💙
Yes. Like, the best friends. Ever. 🤩🙌

💙
Ruberus Hagrid - the gamekeeper of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He’s just the best! When Hagrid entered the cabin, gave Harry a birthday cake and told him that he’s a wizard, it was one of the best moments in this book! Ever!



💙
Hermione Granger. Smart, ambitious, sassy and loyal. She's even good at spellwork, and she loves reading books too! My favorite character in the series so far. 😍❣️



💙
Amazing! The plot development is amazing and it was worth reading it with 288 pages! 🤣👍✨

💙
What I liked about Hogwarts Houses is that they have different elements and unique traits. I would be a Gryffindor if I’m going to attend Hogwarts. 🦁 What about you? I’m very curious to hear it from you. 😊

💙
The book cover looks fantastic, and it was illustrated by Kazu Kibuishi.


💙
We can all agree that Dursley family is just: . I know that it’s a fantasy book, but what kind of family environment is that?! 🙄



💙
I don’t really like Draco in this book because he bullies students from Gryffindor. However, he’s eleven in this book! I’m really looking forward to see him in the other six books of the series because of his character development. I also want to read fan fictions of Dramione too, so feel free to send me some recommendations. 😂✨

💙
Same goes to professor Snape. He’s not a nice teacher and it seems that he disliked Harry from the beginning. Maybe he has a backstory? I don’t know, but I’m also looking forward to find out more about professor Snape in the other six books of the series too. 😗


It's my first time reading and I have enjoyed it a lot. Lots of chuckles and it was easy getting into it. It’s a shame I haven’t read the series till this year, so I will definitely enjoy reading the other books in the series as well! Bravo! 😍👏

107,108,5,"TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN. TRANS MEN ARE MEN. NON-BINARY PEOPLE ARE NON-BINARY.

Harry Potter changed my life and the memories I have associated with it can never be changed or tarnished no matter what its creator says or does. Her comments have caused me so much pain and disappointment and even if one day she realises how ignorant and hateful she has been it is now too late to amend the harm she has caused. Nevertheless, like Daniel Radcliffe said, the relationship between a reader and a book is sacred and nothing can change that. Harry Potter is no longer hers and I will continue loving and cherishing this world and these characters forever (and yes, I will be re-reading the series and watching the movies time and time again during my lifetime).

However, I can no longer support her or her future work. Rowling is TRANSPHOBIC and supporting her in any way, shape or form supports her views and harms trans people and the LGBTQ+ community profoundly. I cannot take back the money I have given her already, but I can choose to never again spend money that will go directly in her pockets.

I want to use this space to encourage everyone to support trans authors and read more literature featuring trans characters.

Please consider donating to a trans charity of your choice () and click to find about more trans organisations in the UK and what you can do to help.

If you still love Harry Potter that’s okay but stop supporting Rowling and stop putting any more money in her pockets. Let’s all actively work together to make this fandom inclusive to everyone and show trans people especially that we are a loving community who would never question their identity or experience.

PS. I have this on the signed section because my copy is signed by Daniel Radcliffe (who in my head is now the real author of Harry Potter anyway):"
108,109,5,"Ignored for years. Thanks, past me! Nice job.

Since I’ve been one of only four people on the planet who had neither read those books nor seen the movies, I guess I can skip the part where I’m telling you what this is about. Of course you know already.

There were a ton of people over the years who tried to convince me. Some were more persistent than others (waves at Ralf, who’ll probably never see this, since he isn’t on Goodreads), some used threats to get me to read it (waves at Trish – yeah, no surprise there), and some were just shaking their heads in disbelief (waves at basically everyone else).

Okay, enough with this waving business. The thing is, usually I know exactly what I like and what I don’t. And seldom does it end well, if someone keeps trying to convince me to read a book that love, but I think doesn’t sound like kind of thing. It’s all tears and afterwards. Well, not this time. I’ve been wrong.



Look, I’ll be completely honest with you. It is not pure, unadulterated love that I’m feeling for this book. But had I read it 23 years ago? Perhaps it might be. And anyway going on about pacing-issues in the beginning and some holes in character development in the middle or in the plot towards the end feels almost academic. Because this book possesses this rarest of qualities. There’s magic in these pages. And this is not some lame attempt at a pun. I mean, I can see the humor and heart in Rowling’s writing. But there’s something else that I can’t quite describe, and that is so difficult to capture for a writer. Which is why you so rarely see it. It just puts a smile on my face, and even though I can’t quite put my finger on it, I just feel that it is there.

This would already have come close to five stars, but the beautiful Kindle in Motion edition pushes it over the top. What a charm."

My heart is full. I am so happy. This story has cleansed me of all my bad reads lately. I want to kiss every copy of this book in existence.

Thank you JK Rowling for this magical story. It's a gift. A gift to the world. Full of magic and subtle humour. It's amazing to see some of the foreshadowing throughout the book as well.

Expect me to re-read this again before the end of the year because I am accepting my life as Harry Potter trash."

""Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die."" <---This definitely sets the tone for the series...funny that as a kid I never realized that.

Gosh, I've missed this series.
I'm not going to bother with a 'proper' review, because no review written by me could ever do this book (or this series for that matter) justice. I'm not going to bother with a description of the plot, because unless you've been living under a rock for the past almost 20 years, you know what Harry Potter is about. Instead, this is just a spot for me to put down my thoughts, feelings and history with this series.

was first released in the US on September 1, 1998 by Scholastic. I was 9 years old...the same age that my daughter (my oldest) is now. But I didn't read this that year. I actually read this out of order initially, and read this book only after reading and falling in love with . So I was 11 the first time I ever picked up a Harry Potter book, the same age as Harry and company in this book. For me, it made it all the more magical and relatable to grow up alongside the characters and to be roughly the same age as they were as the books were released. I had already enjoyed reading, but Harry Potter is the first book series that I ever truly loved...that I could read over and over again, and never grow tired of it.

I still react with shock to the people who tell me they've watched these movies, never read the books (my husband included) and start ranting about all the amazing details they're missing out on...I'm almost as bad as a religious fanatic in that regard, trying to convert everyone into a Potterhead. I can't even watch the movies without thinking about everything from the books being left out.



Now here I am, years later as an adult and with a family of my own, finally reading my illustrated copy of the first Harry Potter book. Which is This edition is a for any true fan.

Now that I'm older, I appreciate Rowling's writing that much more. It truly is magical. She manages to create a whole amazing world, with details galore and manages to introduce you into the world without it feeling like a huge info dump. Everything is so carefully explained, that it all feels completely legit. For me, she will always be the Queen, hands down.

112,113,5,"This is the hardest review I've had to write all year!!!! Sometimes you read a book that's so magnificent, so completely perfect you literally don't have words to describe it and no matter how hard you try, no matter how hard you dig inside yourself, you can’t find the right ones. I adore the entire series and love the educational value and positive messages as well in the book, I could read it over and over again! my childhood was amazing I grew up watching harry potter’s movies as an adult I’m still so amazed by this series it’s my first time reading JK Rowling’s books and I’m loving it ! I can’t wait to read the rest of the series !"
113,114,5,"I'll never forget the magic of this first Harry Potter book. First stepping into Diagon Alley (and how pleased I was when I figured out the play on words), the first train ride on the Hogwarts Express, meeting new friends ... and enemies. First experiencing Hogwarts and the Sorting Hat. Quidditch. Dumbledore."
114,115,5,"Ενδιαφέρεται κανείς για άλλη μια κριτική πάνω σε ένα τέτοιο βιβλίο; Ο Χάρι Πότερ είναι η εμπορικότερη σειρά βιβλίων όλων των εποχών, έχει έναν ήρωα που αποτελεί πια εικόνα της σύγχρονης κουλτούρας, ίσως έχει ριζώσει μέσα στο βαθιά μέσα στο συλλογικό ασυνείδητο ως αρχετυπική φιγούρα μαθητευόμενου μάγου. Το Χόγκογουαρτς, η σχολή των μάγνω, είναι συνώνυμο των επιβλητικών πύργων. Πολλές σκηνές της περιπέτειας είναι εμβληματικές, έχοντας δημιουργήσει ένα μεγάλο κομμάτι της μυθολογίας του σύγχρονου ανθρώπου. Η δε αποδοχή του είναι γνωστή, δεδομένη, και ουδέποτε δημιούργησε αμφιλεγόμενα σχόλια: το βιβλίο είναι καλό.

Ίσως μπορώ να απευθυνθώ σε εκείνους τους εν δυνάμει αναγνώστες που, όπως κι εγώ, δεν διάβασαν τον Χάρι Πότερ. Αλλά πρέπει να το κάνουν. Ο πρώτος τόμος είναι ένα λαχταριστό κατασκεύασμα, ένα παραμύθι διασκεδαστικό, απολαυστικό. Είναι, όμως, κυρίως καλογραμμένο, γεγονός που παραβλέπεται. Ο ορυμαγδός της επιτυχίας υπερκάλυψε τις συγγραφικές δεξιότητες της Ρόουλινγκ. Την γραφή της την είχα γνωρίσει από το The Casual Vacancy, στο οποίο επιδεικνύει μια εντυπωσιακή άνεση στα ψυχογραφήματα, στους περιεκτικούς διαλόγους και στις εξαιρετικές ουσιώδεις περιγραφές των ηρώων. Είναι ένας συγγραφέας που ξέρει να δίνει πνοή στους ήρωές της που κινούνται μέσα στις σελίδες σαν μικρά δημιουργήματα. Είναι αυτή η δύναμη που έχει να ζωντανεύει ξεχωριστές φιγούρες, που ξεφεύγουν από τις καρικατούρες του φανταστικού, και σχηματίζουν ολοκληρωμένες οντότητες.

Η νοσταλγία για το κάποτε, το αλλοτινό και εξωραϊσμένο της παιδικής μας ηλικίας, το καταφύγιο της αθωότητας - είναι όλα τούτα που έχουν εξαπλωθεί ταχύτατα στην μουσική, την λογοτεχνία και την τηλεόραση τα τελευταία χρόνια. Σε αυτό το τοπίο, αυτό το βιβλίο είναι πιο απαραίτητο από ποτε. Πολύ σκοτάδι γύρω μας. Ίσως ο Χάρι να φωτίσει έστω λίγο τα σκοτάδια που μας ζώνουν!

Υ.Γ. Ο πρώτος και ο δεύτερος τόμος αγοράστηκαν υπό τις ιδανικές συνθήκες: στο waterstone του Εδιμβούργου. Στον δεύτερο όροφο, από την μεγάλη τζαμαρία, δεσπόζει το Κάστρο της πόλης. Θυμίζει λίγο Χόγκουαρτς, σκέφτηκα καθώς πλήρωνα, με τα βιβλία παραμάσχαλα."
115,116,5,"In my gradual return to books after my harrowing experience with Mockingjay, I've built myself up to Harry Potter:
Five stars to a book that is what it is and isn't what it's not. Make sense? This is a middle school children's book and when it's read as such it's great. I see people giving this one or two stars and I scratch my head in wonderment. Do they compare it to Shakespeare or Hemmingway? Do they read it as it was meant to be read or are they bringing snooty, intellectual baggage to the table. You are smart. We get it. You are all a bunch of geniuses—now try having some fun!
If you enjoyed this review you'll probably like my Youtube reviews--be warned, I enjoy some good snark!"
116,117,5,"After I don't even know how many times I've read Harry Potter.. I honestly don't know what to write anymore. It's just a really good book and makes me happy to read. I adore the friendship between Harry, Hermione, and Ron so much. The Dursley's are still assholes but Harry's sass when he's with them just makes me laugh. I can't wait to fall back in love with everything else that happens throughout this series. THEN I will re-watch all the movies as well.
____________________________________
Okay, so this is a re-read, obviously, and I am still freaking in love with these characters and the whole god damn story. I can't believe this is only my second time re-reading this book. I feel like I should just live under a rock because one of my cousins re-reads this entire season every year. I mean.. I've watched the movies every year (#HarryPotterMovieMarathonWeekend) but that's about it. Maybe I need to re-evaluate my life and plan to re-read these books ever year now.



Anyways, back to this amazing book that I love so freaking much.



Let's talk about the Dursleys. UGH THOSE FREAKING PEOPLE MAKE ME SO MAD. I wouldn't be upset at all if they tragically died or ya know some how mysteriously disappeared. The whole family is vile and I just want to bitch slap all of them at the same time. Or ya know just punch them square in the face repeatedly.



Then there's Harry freaking Potter is adorably naïve about things. I love his friendship with both Hermione and Ron. Now I can't pick a favorite out of this trio of friends - but they are my favorite trio of friends ever written about. Seriously if I could somehow jump into that group of friends I would probably be the happiest girl ever. Also, can we mention how quickly Harry declined Draco's ""friendship"" - man he hit the denied button so quick and didn't give a single fuck about it. I loved it.



Now onto Fluffy, Fang, and Hagrid. Man, Hagrid is probably my favorite person ever. I love that big giant man and probably will forever and ever. Also, can I get a Fluffy? I don't have anything that needs protecting - I just really want a three-headed dog of my own. Can you say bad ass dog?!?



Oh Dumbledore you are such a mysterious man who somehow ends up being a slight bad ass. You sneaky sneaky man you. Snape is awesome as well - although he wont become my favorite until later one in the series I just love his sass.



Seriously I'm so in love with this series and this book I don't know if I'll ever come down from my Harry Potter high. Also, I know that there were spoilers in this book but come on - I'm not going to hide them because this book is so well-freaking-known that everyone should have read it at least once by now. So I'm not sorry people if you read this and get butt hurt about spoilers. You should've read this book already."
117,118,5,"What in the world was I waiting for?

Most decidedly curmudgeonly! Yes, that's it. One of the few remaining people on the planet who hadn't read any of the Harry Potter novels and, like Vernon Dursley, my initial reaction to all this wizard and magic rubbish was a very mugglish ""stuff and nonsense"". I admit it. As I read the first few pages, my initial thoughts were that this was all quite silly. Where had this Harry Potter phenomenon come from and what did everybody see in it?

But then, very quickly actually, JK Rowling, undoubtedly a graduate of Hogwarts herself, began to weave a most hypnotic magical spell and I was hooked. Transported to that child-like garden of delights at Hogwarts - a land of fantasy, witches, warlocks, trolls, spells, potions, charms and, for the readers, total enjoyment and smiles - I fell in love with Harry, Hermione, all of their Gryffindor classmates, and with Dumbledore's paternal wisdom and I cheered wildly as Harry, the team seeker, dove and swooped in quest of the Snitch during their quidditch matches.

There is a benefit, of course, to having waited so long to read my first Harry Potter novel, you know. I've got six to go and now I can pick them up, one after another, just as quickly as I want to with no waiting for years at a time for the next book to be published. Eat your hearts out everyone! I claim membership in the legion of Rowling's happy fans.

Highly recommended.

118,119,5,"Wow! Watching the movie was one thing, but reading it is completely something else! I wish I didn't watch the movies first >__< Or should I say, I wished I read the books first!

My first impressions:
1) I didn't realize how humorous some parts of the book were! Albus Dumbledore, you're definitely off your rocker; but I LOVE IT!
2) The friendships, and interaction between all the characters are great. I love the love/hate relationship going on between Ron and Hermione.
3) Harry is a spunky kid isn't he? For a 11 year old he really knows how to hold his own. Well done sir!
4) Neville Longbottom. What can I say? He's the true hero, isn't he? :)
5) Love The Mirror of Erised chapter.
6) Quidditch is amazing. Can I be a Beater?
7) Excellent writing. Great setup for the rest of the books!

Check out my full review here:"
119,120,5,"Finally I would be doing a review of the book that made me plunge into the wonderland of texts.

Catch you soon on this space."
120,121,5,"Here's how stupid I am.

I hated the idea of The Lord of the Rings movies when they were being made because, being a huge Star Wars fan, I was afraid LOTR would supplant Star Wars as people's most beloved ""fantasy"" movie series.

Then I watched LOTR and fell in love with the movies. Now I'm a huge fan of both the books and the films.

But while my love for LOTR was growing, I grew to hate Harry Potter. Not for any real reason, but simply because there were people who preferred Harry to Frodo and Dumbledore to Gandalf. That made me gnash my teeth and secretly curse J.K. Rowling for daring to vie with the amazing inhabitants of Middle Earth.

See, I told you I was stupid.

Mainly, this comes down to my competitiveness, but that's neither here nor there. What is both here and there is that my son and I began to read the first Harry Potter book a year and a half ago.

And I've been in love ever since.

I'll write more about the Harry Potter series soon (we're immersed in the wonderful fifth book right now), so for now I'll just say that these novels are gifts. I cherish them, I love the characters, and I feel nothing but warmth toward everything about the stories. As an author, I'm astonished at J.K. Rowling's storytelling skills. She really is a marvelous writer.

So I hereby apologize for all my silly mental competitive negativity toward the Harry Potter books. When my son and I finish the last book, I vow to read the entire series again with my middle child (a lovely daughter) and my youngest child (another lovely daughter). If you've been waffling about reading this series, waffle no more. It is amazing. It is spellbinding. It is what reading is all about."
121,122,5,"This series is the whole entire reason my love for reading began. I read it for the first time 3 years ago, and no matter what JKR decides to do or say, I am not ashamed to say that the Harry Potter series is forever gonna be my first love.

I obviously can't describe my love for this book in words, so this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make a collection of quotes from each book.

Here's the one for this. If you haven't read this (for some weird reason) then I'd suggest you don't read the review ahead, not cause there are any major spoilers, but because most of the stuff won't make sense to you, and if you're a Potterhead like me, well, get ready for the nostalgia <3






























































Are you crying yet? Cause as if re-reading the book that defined my early middle school years wasn't enough, writing this review just brought back all the feels... ahh I love this series!!

Completed a re-read after many, many years... with the good folk over at Fantasy Buddy Reads. This book should be required reading for any budding story teller as it displays a huge amount of skill.

I could go on and on, but the characters are whispering that they want a word or two.



Vernon Dursley: ""I have no idea why the Potter boy had to come back from School. By the way, would you like a nice drill bit, I have thousands...""

Petunia Dursley: ""Vernon ... could you tell me about your drill bit again? About the length of the shaft? About the thickness of the shank? I really would like to hear this story more than once.""

Dudley Dursley: ""It's a little known fact, that post surgery I kept my little pig's tail in a jar of embalming fluid. I've got it hidden beneath my bed. I often think of it, sometimes I take it out and stroke it. It whispers things to me, wonderful things, dreadful things, things I'd like to do one day....""

Hagrid: ""Well, I must say, my elocution lessons have paid off handsomely.""

The Sorting Hat: ""Centuries ago, I proposed the school houses be called, 'The Dungeons,' 'The Tower,' 'The Basement.' 'The Other Tower' (Yeah, I know, confusing, but that would be part of the fun), and then I'd get to say to new students, 'Off to The Dungeons with ye,' or 'Off to the Tower,' - what fun! - but was I allowed? No. Bloody Wizards!""

Draco Malfoy: ""I applied for the role of 'Harry Potter,' and look what happened, (shakes head disconsolately), it's a complete balls up. I complained to the author, but it did no good. Now I'm struck in the dungeons with Crabbe and Goyle, and they're no fun. Now, where's that nifty 'make your own lightning bolt scar makeup' ... it must be somewhere round this gloomy place.""

Ron Weasley: ""I applied for the role of 'Harry Potter,' too, but fortunately, I got the 'best friend,' role. Everyone knows the best friend always survives. And also, just quietly, you know, there's that thing with Ginny and Harry in the future, and you know, well, just ewwww! - she's my sister!""

Hermione: ""Well, it's called 'The Voldemort Smackdown Club,' and I'm president. Well, it makes perfect sense to me - don't you agree?""

Professor Snape: ""I applied for the role of Voldemort. I know, I didn't get it, now stop bloody well reminding me about it.""

Scene #38: Take #14: INT: The Leaky Cauldron: Professor Quirrell shakes Harry's hand for the first time.

Quirrell: ""Potter, pleasss-ed to meets you. Pleasss-ed exxx-scuse my lissssp.""

""CUT! Quirrell, it's a stutter, not a lisp. Now set up for take #15... Geez, now get it right.""

Quirrell: ""I can't help it! It's him, beneath the turban, he's telling me to do it!""

Voldemort: ""Well, I applied for the role of Potter as well. My plan was brilliant, flawless, a perfection of genius. I would solve all my problems with a single stroke - yes, it would be that easy - I'd just kill myself.""

Professor Dumbledore: ""A nudge here, a nudge there, and whipsabobbly, Fanny's your uncle and Bob's your aunt, or some such.""

Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback: ""Well, Teddy. It's just you and me now. Send us off in a crate to Romania did they? Just wait till I grow up - I'll show 'em what a chew toy really looks like.""

And finally Harry...

Harry Potter: ""I literally spent ten years living in a cupboard under the stairs, half-starving myself, and giving myself wedgies every night in preparation for this role. Boy, was I relieved when I got it. Imagine, if I'd done all that for nothing?""

124,125,5,"J.K. Rowling struck magic with Harry Potter the very same year my first child was born.

I was a young mom at the time, a book geek, and a wannabe witch, too, and I just knew that my precious infant, still so small in his crib, would grow, one day, to love Harry Potter. I dutifully attended every premiere in my black witch's hat and purchased each first edition hardcover, but denied myself the story. I was determined that we would read them all together.

And we did. But, first, I made my son wait until he was Harry's age at the series beginning before I cracked the first cover.

To this day, these read-aloud sessions with my son are some of my most favorite memories with him. I read books 1-6 aloud to him, in my room or his, for 1-2 hours every evening. There was no talking over the books, no interruptions. We spun a certain web of magic around ourselves and one of the most darling things he ever said to me one evening was, “But, Mom, we're not real Muggles, because we're the kind of people who to do magic.”

Yes.

But, after we doubled ourselves over with painful sobs after book #6, my son decided he wanted to read book #7 alone. He had reached adolescence, and perhaps the crying had embarrassed him. I honored his request, but I suffered privately. was the last book I read aloud to him.

Then we had a new problem. He not only wanted to read the stories to himself, he wanted to read those beautiful, first edition hardcovers. . . with beverages and snacks and such in his hands.

Being a capable witch, I quickly remedied this by going online and purchasing the books in paperbacks and presenting them to him at Christmas.

But, when my daughter turned the same magical age as the young Harry Potter late this past summer, neither the hardcovers nor the paperworks were working for her. Little sis loves stories, but she's an artist who has some struggles with reading, and the graphic novel is her preferred genre.

I so badly wanted to re-read them all to her and ALSO, our family was headed to Hogsmeade at Universal for Christmas, and, you know, it all makes so much more sense if you've at least started the series.

Wouldn't you know it. . . just as we were wondering WHAT to do, my Goodreads friend, LaDonna, posted her review for the new Harry Potter books, the ones illustrated by Jim Kay.

I thought . (If my husband is reading this, what I mean is. . . from the ). I decided to splurge and buy the first one in the series and see how the girls responded to it.

It is a gorgeous book and both daughters sat, well, , one on each side of me, spell-bound by both the story and the illustrations. I don't even want to think about $40 x 7 for now, but I will contribute that book #2 is on its way.

Oh, and Hogsmeade at Universal last week? I do not exaggerate when I tell you that I turned the corner into the village and let the hot tears of awe spring to my eyes."
125,126,5,"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.


I have lost count on how many times i have read this book but i will always come back to this series from time to time because i always love returning home to Hogwarts.

the first book in the series setting up the entire series that sets up the entire series and JK Rowling created a world full of magic, friendship and love that has captivated a generation of readers and many more to come. Harry is an 11 year old boy who thinks he is living and ordinary life but soon finds out he is apart of this magical community that he had no idea existed. His journey is just beginning he is thrown into a world he has no idea about and to make matters worse the whole wizard community knows his name because his parents were murdered by lord Voldemort and he was the only survivor. I love the tone that JK set up because i felt all the emotions that Harry was feeling from learning out he was a wizard all the way to him beginning his first term at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. Friendship is one of the biggest driving forces of this story because Harry, Ron and Hermione create this bond that is strong that it helps drive the story forward.








The main character and who's story this whole series focus's on and i have enjoyed reading his journey over and over for the past 17 years and its been magical. Harry is just learning about the world hes thrown into and after living with the dursleys for so long i'm happy that Harry got away even just for a couple of months. I love how were learning about this world as Harry is and have the same feelings he has towards magic, but he does grow a lot throughout the book and matures quite a bit for a 11 year old.


Ron is harry's best friend and the comedic relief throughout the entire series for me and i love how Ron provided all the light hearted and funny moments for us during this series. Ron even though he isn't the most focused person at times has a heart of gold and really represents a true gryffindor. Ron really knows how to care for his friends and family and goes that extra mile to make sure they are all cared for. I have always believed that Ron would also be a very good Hufflepuff because he has some of those traits and would have done well in Hufflepuff.


Harry's other best friend and the brains that keeps Harry and Ron in check and she is one of my favourite characters in this entire series. She might be bossy and nosy at times but she always has everyones interest to succeed at heart and even though she doesn't have very good people skills i think that's one thing she truly works hard to fix. Hermione is everything i wished i was at school more focused and more intelligent because she's so driven it does usually come off to people as bossy. Hermione is the friend for the other two so she can keep an eye on them and keep them in check even though sometimes the plans they come up with involved Hermione because they truly need her help because without her they would be lost. Hermione not only has Gryffindor traits she also has traits of a Ravenclaw and would have done extremely well in either house.


We don't see a lot of Professor Dumbledore in this book he always makes an impact in Harry's life even though he's not psychically there. I have come to realise that Dumbledore left little clues and hints for harry because he knew that Harry would try and save people from this looming threat. Dumbledore isn't one of my favourite characters of this series is very wise and knows what is what and is very helpful towards Harry for this entire series.


one of my favourite characters of this series and hands down my favourite teacher at the school. Professor McGonagall can be strict and harsh sometimes but she truly wants the best for her students and wants them to succeed to their highest potential. She can be stern but deep down is a fighter of what is right and wrong and always stands up for those who don't have a voice which i love because she comes off as a stern woman.





I will always come back to this series when ever i feel like i need some magic in my life or are just simply missing these characters and world, if you are looking for a magical journey than this series is for you because it takes you on that journey and offers you so much more.

as JK Rowling once said: and it truly feels like that i'm welcome each time i head back into this world."
126,127,5,"Wow! This book was awesome and excellent all wrapped up together in a bow!

It has taken me a long time to step into this world as far as the books go, but I have already been in this world with the movies as I own the complete dvd set. I just hadn't stepped into the book world part...until now.



I am not going to do a backstory like I normally do with my reviews as everyone worldwide knows the story of Harry Potter as this book is now considered a classic, but I will give my thoughts on how the book made me feel.

I loved all the characters even Malfoy as he just gets under my skin, but nothing gets under my skin worse than the Dursleys. They are the worst excuse for an Uncle and Aunt treating Harry the way they did. Dudley of course is a spoiled brat, but thankfully Harry is able to at least get some peace away from all of them when he goes to Hogwarts.

I thought that the book was more detailed than the movie as I could see some different variations throughout the book, but the movie didn't step too far away from the actual happenings that are in the book. I thought that Snape seemed more ""mean and hateful"" in the book compared to the movie. In the movie, he is more tolerable but in the book he just has a mean streak in him that runs a little rampant.

The friendship of Harry, Hermione, and Ron just meshes together so well in the book that it almost makes them seem like the three musketeers - always together and always in some kind of trouble. There is quite a bit of that ""one for all and all for one"" going on with them in the story as they would rather stick together then go it alone when it comes to going on their adventure capers around the school.



It is kind of funny but after seeing all the movies and now reading the book, I could actually see stuff played out from the movie instead of my imagination. Normally when reading books your imagination makes things up as you read the books of how the world looks, but when reading books that have been converted to movies there is no imagination left as the only thing you see is what you have already seen a hundred times on the movie screen! The book was still enjoyable, fun, and very entertaining. Giving this one five stars!

For more images and thoughts, please see my blog:"
127,128,5,"“It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.”



To give you an overview of the story…



As if I was gonna do that. I wouldn’t want to be pelted with rotten tomatoes, mind you. Lol. ^^

As for my review, I politely refer you to all other great five star reviews of this book and think of every little thing good you can think of, every beautiful word that comes to mind, every amazing feeling you remember, those are what I will say of this book, of the characters, of the writing and of everything about the book.

The only challenge I encountered reading this was this little voice speaking in perfect British accent that was manipulating my entire reading. That stubborn voice prolonged the entire process because it wanted to be heard and so many times that voice managed its way through my mouth making me read the words aloud in this foreign voice that’s definitely not my own. Lol. ^^

I know I’m not making sense anymore so I’ll stop but before that let me just say that I loved all the characters (of course except the despicable ones) but that who made the strongest impression upon me is….surprise, surprise!



That quote above belongs to him. He amuses and surprises me all the time despite his little but hugely significant roles in the entire story. I was laughing out loud at his mention of eating a vomit flavored bean and then trying another only to taste the earwax flavored one. But except from his hilarity, everything he says is a precious gem.



I know it sounds too much, but I was laughing and crying at the book’s perfect ending. Everything is just perfect!



Thank you, Hayat for this reading challenge and thank you Isabelle for providing me the book. You guys are the best! <3 <3 <3"

Every time I reread this I get so mad at how everyone hates on Hufflepuff and Slytherin, but ALAS, you can't have it all!

Here are some of my favourite quotes:"
129,130,5,"Harry Potter has and always will have a special place in my heart, so my rating comes as no surprise. However, my rereading of the first book this time around was quite special because I read the recently published illustrated version. I must say that the illustrations very much enhanced the story and made it even more magical. They are unique because they don't look like what we see in the movies, but at the same time they were exactly as I would've pictured them to be. I imagine that any child who has a hard time imagining this fantasy world would only find help and guidance in this illustrated version. I know I loved it, and I can't wait till the second edition comes out."
130,131,5,"I swear to God I haven't been living under a rock. It's just that my brother was a complete monster who never learned the concept of sharing and wouldn't let me touch his precious collection of Harry Potter books. Maybe, that's why I never got around to reading this series. And in a way, I had been associating HP with my asshole brother all this while and resentment makes you do lame things. Like, not letting you read the bestttttt book ever. Uff, I am dumb. No excuses. Better 10 years late than never!!!
Anyway, thanks to one amazing soul, I finally got my hands on these babies and it has been wonderful. Needless to say, I'm obsessed with Hogwarts.
Fun fact - This book and I happen to share a birthday. So obviously 5 stars. (Also considering the fact that J.K.Rowling is a fricking genius!)
Recommended to pretty much everyone!

Note to self: Someday, write an actual review instead of senseless rants.

Someday!🤞"

Thoughts after re-reading:

5 BRILLIANT STARS

You know, the first time I read this series was when I was 15, and I gave this particular novel 3 stars (you're probably like, ). It wasn't until recently that I kept on looking at that 3 star rating and wondering why in the world I rated it so poorly - this Harry Potter we're talking about after all. And I do love anything/everything Harry Potter (I can watch the movies like 3 times in a row and not get bored). So, naturally, I figured it was time for a re-read. Being as I am 19 and all - 4 years without touching these books seemed too long. And, well, I'm glad that I did pick it up again! I knew the 3 star rating was far too low.

Just everything about this book is phenomenal, even if it rather child-like. But that OK. They're only 11 years old after all! Regardless, all these characters and just fills me with such nostalgia. It's a beautiful thing.

My biggest complaint, overall, would have to be the cover of this novel (and the rest of them). I never did like them much.

I would be crazy not to rate this 5 stars. Onto re-reading the next one."
132,133,5,"This is still as good as ever!
And I still cried at the end like an idiot lol.
AND HAGRID IS STILL THE BEST 10/10"

It is so hard to write a book review for a book you have known and loved all your life. I think that every praise I have to say here has already been said before. I remember watching the first Harry Potter movie with my family, my aunts and cousins in the cinema. In Macedonia at that time, this was a big deal. My auntie and cousin have already read the books, and they already had their collection set. And I knew I was also going to have my own collection when I grow up.



Harry Potter followed me through my primary school and then in high school as well. I met friends that also loved the series and we formed a bond similar to what Harry, Ron and Hermione have. We weren’t too much of a trouble makers, but we did know to fight when we thought something was not fair. 




From the very first scene, to the mention of each character, a shiver ran down my spine, of excitement and nostalgia of a world that was always part of me, even though I’ve never been physically there. A world that has accepted me and a place I could always call home when there was nowhere else to turn. 

Reading the book now again, I re-visited moments I never thought I have forgotten: 
- the list of books and items a first-year student needs. This time, I even made a list of all the fictional books mentioned, and will try to find and read those as well. 
- the engraved poem when entering the Gringotts Bank. 










- the family bond of the Weasleys, alongside with the love their mother has for them and their cheeky jokes. I wish I could visit them on a Sunday afternoon and have a Sunday Roast at their place - it would be such a warm atmosphere with lots of giggles.



















- The Sorting Hat scene and the poem where the houses are explained.
- The train scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione meet each other for the first time. I was reading this scene and I was like: “You’ll all be best friends and you don’t know it yet!
- Dumbledore - how mysterious he is this whole book! It makes you want to keep reading the other books, because you know you will get to know him better! 
- Neville Longbottom and his bravery! 



Harry Potter will forever be part of my childhood and have an impact on my life as an adult. I will forever cherish this fictional world and I will never get over the fact that when I was eleven years old, I never got the mail from Hogwarts. Maybe they didn’t deliver mails to Macedonia :D

137,138,5,"The magic Rowling created with this book is phenomenal. Totally hooked for life! One boy who will always be remembered has to be Harry Potter.

The story starts with Harry losing both his parents, ends up living with the Dursleys, his maternal aunt and uncle, who are cruel to him all the time. But his life changes after he gets a letter from Hogwarts.

Hagrid gets him an owl as a gift and Harry names it Hedwig - cutest name! He makes his lifelong friends at Hogwarts - Ron and Hermione and with their help stops Voldemort (the one who killed both his parents) from taking the Sorcerer’s Stone.

138,139,5,rereading this was was a lovely experience and was exactly what I needed right now! The illustrated edition was gorgeous! It added so much and made it a totally different reading experience. I can definitely picture myself reading this copy to my hypothetical future children... :') I don't think my love for this series could ever end. I picked up on so many things I didn't the first time reading it and of course I now have a huge craving to watch the movie...

145,146,5,"I am not going to review Harry Potter, that is just an impossible task. However, after reading many people's personal stories linked to Harry Potter I got inspired to share mine as well! It'll be a long and boring reminiscing....

My childhood was not exposed to J.K.Rowling. In fact, Harry Potter remained untouched until I was 12 years old.

I was an avid reader of spooky books. Many children at that age were probably attending Hogwarts already (Harry Potter was booming back then) but I was stuck in another planet where your worst nightmares can come to life. Other times, I'll be battling off angry ghosts from lighthouses, zapping aliens with laser guns, dodging dungeon trolls, wrestling off demonic doppelgangers, getting haunted by talking dummies and going back and forth from one dimension to the next. Sometimes, I was scouring places for clues to solve puzzling mysteries.

I suppose you can say that

Finally, I was burnt out from all my usual, preferable book series. I have completed all the adventures had offered, I've read by countless times already that I made myself sick of it, I was dead tired of 's repetitions in his books, and I didn't own enough copies of series by . I had else to read aside from childish picture books. 

Then come one day when my sister came home with a bulging plastic bag from Times bookstore. When we spilled out the content together, there were 4 books and was among them.

You see, when I was first introduced to Harry Potter, I did not start with The Sorcerer's Stone as I should have but instead, the starter book for me was (My sister was a bit of a noob at book buying. She didn't realize she bought the second book instead of the first!). I remembered thinking how this world of witchcraft & wizardry was. And believe me, I've read some strange stuffs before Harry Potter came into the picture.

I knew I had missed out on a few details from the first book but I've watched the movies and they were enough to provide me the information I needed to know.

Here's where the plot twist come to play - right after I was done with , I extinguished Harry Potter out of my mind. My sister and I did not want to own the rest of the books either. Plus, I simply wasn't that interested to continue reading and thought it was quite pointless to read the books when the movies were at my reach. (You are more than welcomed to kick the old me in the shins. I can't believe I was so unimaginative!)

It was 4 years later, at 16, when I re-returned to this series. I was quite late to jump into bandwagon, I know but damn it, the last movie ended quite a while ago and I've rewatched and rewinded them all so many times than I can count.

Well, I was still side-eyeing the books mistrustfully but one day, when I was feeling rebellious, I bought the entire box set (my old copy of was long lost) and here I am, doing my 5th reread of the series.

That much I realized. I feel like kicking myself even as I write this for thinking, once, that the Harry Potter movies are better than the books. I didn't truly or fully apprecite the written words before but

This being my fifth reread, I was worried the analytical reader in me will shred the book apart and nitpick every single details but to my surprise, I did not. I still love every single moment as much as I had the first time around. I still found The Dursleys reaction to magic hilariously comical, Hermione's and Ron's banters are adorable and rip-roaringly funny at times (oh, they were so meant to be) and I enjoyed J.K.Rowling's ability to weave up an entire new bizarre world with its own set systems and good lord, her food description is absolutely fantastic. My mouth waters even at the thought of Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Juice, Butterbeer and every single meals the house elves at Hogwarts have to offer. I'd even try a taste at Bertie Bott's Every Flavour beans.

In a nutshell, this entire series is utterly magical (Need I say more?) and I won't ever forget this anytime soon."
146,147,5,"Hello, my name is Trish and I'm a Potterhead. As a ginormous fan of the HP series, I've reviewed a number of different editions (audio, hardcover, deluxe illustrated edition, Gryffindor house edition/Hufflepuff house edition/Ravenclaw house edition/Slytherin house edition). I've kept most and gave away some others and then finally discovered the edition my heart had been waiting for: this one.

MinaLima is the name of the creative team behind the movie set decorations (newspapers, packaging for sweets etc) that consists of Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima. They've recently started creating special editions of a number of beloved and famous children's classics but that might have only been their opening act to this truly epic special edition of the HP series.

If you want to know more about the story itself, the boy who lived and his first year at a school for witchcraft and wizardry, please read one of the reviews I've linked to above. This review is exclusively about this visually stunning edition and it's marvellous attention to detail.

As has become ""normal"" for MinaLima books, what makes this edition literally special is not just the creators' style but the fact that they include numerous interactive elements such as a very special clock, the moving portrait guarding the entrance to the Gryffindor common room, a fold-out of Diagon Alley and Hogwarts Castle and so much more.

Here are some examples of the interactive elements:

(Yes, that is the letter from Hogwarts and it is a 100% replica of the one we know from both the book and the movie. *squeals*)

(When you turn the page, you see the brick wall that then opens up to this spread.)

(Not sure you can actually see all the details in the single rooms and grounds but they are there and they are fantastic.)

This is what the chapter title pages look like:


Here's an example of the ""normal"" art:


And this is the artwork that adorns the text:

(Sometimes, the art is more toned down, like when there's ""only"" different magical sweets framing the text, but it's always whimsical and very cool.)

Another thing that made me very happy was that the creators included artwork befitting the original story and not the version we know from the movies (the movies made quite some mistakes that have become established by now and I don't like that at all - Ravenclaw emblem, anyone?). So we get details like the glasses in Hogwarts corridor showing the current house points and I'm sure this means they'll keep including awesome details only the readers of the series know (like how the food ends up on the banquet tables in the Great Hall etc).

The quality of the pages and the print as well as of the interactive pieces is stunning and results in the book being quite thick (I'm mentioning this because it makes me curious about what volumes 4 and 5 will look like then). It means that the feel, when you're holding the book, is quite the experience all by itself.

I can honestly say that this might be the best version of the HP book(s) out there so far and that includes the aforementioned deluxe illustrated edition - it's THAT GOOD (and the size makes it a bit more handy)! So I'm very happy that this was my Christmas gift to myself because this story is also perfect for this time of year."
147,148,5,"This is my first reread of this book in almost 20 years, and let me tell you this - It is an ultimate book that EVERYONE should read! I mean it. If you have never read it, what are you doing? Go pick it up and read! Now!

This is a story that needs no introduction. This is one of the most magical things (if not the most magical) I've ever come across, and I'm so glad for being brought up reading these books.

During this reread I discovered several things I definitely had not noticed when I was a child. If you are a child you don't really see Hermione's irritating bossy behaviour, or Ron's jealousy, you only start spotting it if you have a certain amount of experience behind your back. I guess, that is a part of the reasons why this book is so phenomenal - both children and adults would read it and find different things there, and both children and adults will end up loving it.

It’s a book about friendship, about adventures, about love, and honestly, about what really matters in life. I couldn't help but think that it is ""Children's introduction to human behaviour"" on top of it.

Harry Potter books and movies are like returning home, and believe me, I will be returning to this story every time when I need a reminder of why I've started reading in the first place."
148,149,5,"I must admit I never had any interest in Harry Potter and didn't plan to ever read it or watch the movies. However, I had a category in a reading challenge that said something like this: ""Try to change my mind - read a book you know you won't like"". I knew immediately I wanted to try Harry Potter for this prompt - make it a real challenge to myself! Obviously I've heard about this series nonstop from everywhere...but just knew I wasn't into fantasy, wizards, and magic! What in the world was this Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin shenanigans I've seen everywhere?!

With that being said... I loved this! It was so much fun and I can't wait to continue on with the rest of the books. I think I liked it more than I thought because it seemed more Middle Grade than Young adult (not a big fan of YA). Even being for younger readers, I always imagined it being something that made no sense, would probably confuse me, and just be dumb. I typically have a hard time following sci-fi or fantasy type things. However, the world was explained and laid out so well that I never had that problem. I was fascinated, intrigued, and glued to all the adventures and mysteries going on. I might try to re-work my goal and read the rest of the series in 2020."
149,150,5,"“There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.”

How I missed being in this world once again!❤ This is the first time I read Philosopher's Stone in the beautiful illustrated edition and I loved the experience! I'm probably going to binge read the whole series now (and then watch the films), because one little - gorgeous! - book was not enough of Harry Potter in my life right now. I love all these characters so much. In this book, the most special place in my heart hold: Dumbledore, Hagrid, Hermione, Harry, Snape, Fred and George."
150,151,5,"GOODREADS SUCKS! GOODREADS SUCKS! GOODREADS TOTALLY SUCKS! Why can't I rate this book a million or billion or even more than trillion of stars rating here on Goodreads? WHY? WHY? WHY? Five stars rating is absolutely not enough, solve this problem now, Goodreads! Or is there any option to give it that kind of rating? If there is, then, send me an owl."

It's always a delight, then, to come back to the book and realize how things are different and that there is so much extra material. Chronicling my rereading means getting to see how much my love and appreciation for this first book has grown. Some of the simplicity I saw originally gets recolored when you see the ways that Rowling was building a world and a bigger story from the beginning.

I think I'll work on getting a whole video out about this book this year? Big dreams.

[May 26, 2017]
[December 12, 2016] Marking for reread

[October 31, 2015] After reading J.K. Rowling's writing as Robert Galbraith I was inspired to start a re-read of this series. IDK. Go with it.

This re-read was marked by how much humor and wit I found in little one off lines. Plus, my appreciating for Harry grew by leaps and bounds. Main characters often get rather shafted when it comes to fan love. When you ask people who their favorite HP character is, they'll probably say someone other than Harry. Probably because they either think he's a given, or think that some of the other more novel characters steal the spotlight. I have some of those favorites too. My point is only that Harry stood out to me on this re-read. He really is such a brave, good-hearted person. Even when we meet him at the Dursley's, the attitude he assumes living in really crappy conditions is admirable. I love him to bits and pieces.

I think I love this book with a special love because while there is a big show down with Voldemort, there is something incredibly light hearted about this book compared to the other ones. My re-reading always stalls as we get further into the series because of all the heartbreak, but here, it's all meeting friends and discovering secrets and establishing relationships.

Good fun.

Onward.

[October 7, 2013] Marking for re-read.

This is only my second time through the series. After the first time, my impression of The Sorcerer's Stone was that it was markedly ""kiddie"" compared to the rest of the series, and that the story overall seemed slow.

It's amazing how much love for the series as a whole has recolored my view. I sped right through the book, this time, and enjoyed every moment of it. I didn't have that same impression of the story being young, but rather now, I was reading about these characters I love at the beginning of the journey.

This book contains some of the most memorable lines of the series, and it was especially great to see Harry, Ron and Hermione at the onset of their friendship."
158,159,5,"Edit 21-01-2018 Although I have read it many times already but this was a read very special to me. All thanks to my favorite set of people on Goodreads. I couldn't have enjoyed it more if it wasn't for you guys. I'll read it again, that's for sure... but as I said THIS read will ALWAYS be special so a BIG THANKS to all of you :)

Cheers for the awesomeness TABAHI we are :P and let's just say..



________

Reviewing this book is impossible for me. Not because people have already said all the things possible but for me it's like measuring your closest friend or any loved one on the parameters of good and bad. Surely they will have both the qualities but you purposefully choose to overlook not so good ones because of the love you have for them. Same is the case with this book, I have literally lived a life with and the other characters of this series. All these characters are as much my friends (or enemies) as anyone in flesh and blood; and since this book was the beginning of it all, it holds an important place in my little library and heart as well. Probably this is the reason I have numerous editions of this book :)

Right from that till the time harry decided ; every single line is just perfect. Those who think that this is a story for kids, or watching the movies is enough; well! they couldn't be more wrong. It's been more than a decade since I read it first and still I haven't found any book or series which has as much of impact on me as this one. The best thing is that no matter how many times have you read them before you just can't help it but to fall in love with Jo's world and characters all over again. She literally has created with this and missing something as good as this is a crime."
159,160,5,"I first picked up The Philosopher's Stone about seven years ago. I'd gone from reading true crime and biographies, to having just finished the Twilight saga, when the Harry Potter series was recommended to me. From memory I think I read the first two chapters and then put it down. It felt really young and I felt it just wasn't for me. So I moved on. After starting my IG account I was constantly bombarded with people telling me how amazing the series was and how I had to read it. I'm not even sure why I decided to give it another try, but I did. And it just goes to show that even if a book is not meant for you when you first pick it up, it doesn't mean that at another time it won't be something that you love. Because this book... This book was brilliant! It was enchanting and captivating and magical. I was completely engrossed from the very first page. I absolutely adored the friendship between Harry and Ron, and the dynamic was completed once Hermione was accepted into the little group. And Hermione, boy she was awesome! She had me grinning from ear to ear. I'm so intrigued by Snape, and I can't wait to peel back all his layers to see what he has hidden. And then there's the gentle giant that is Hagrid. My heart is so full of love for him. My favourite character so far! I can't tell you how incredibly happy I am to have given this series a second chance. I can now officially say I'm well on my way to being a Potterhead!"
160,161,5,"I've read and re-read this book in Turkish, in English and the paperback format, ebook format. This time, I've decided to try audible version. Since, this being my umpteenth reread, tells about my feelings about the book, I'll just comment on the audio experience.

The narrator I'm listening to is Stephen Fry. I've listened to a comparison vid before deciding on him. While both are good narrators, Fry suited better to me. And I think he was the best choice after listening the whole book. He is the first male narrator I've listened to who didn't think reading a female voice means, giving this annoying shrilly quality to his voice.

Even though I've had a voice in my head for every character, after watching the movies, he didn't sound foreign to me. He was that good! With most of the voices... His Harry voice was the single annoying thing about him. It was just whiny. But all in all I've really enjoyed his reading."
161,162,5,"“Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!”
-Dumblydore.

I believe I’m in Hogwarts, therefore I am ;)

This is my fifth re-read and WHOA! I’m still not bored! Reading this brought back so many good memories of me growing up and how I saw Harry’s world as a place that I took comfort in when I was feeling dejected. Reading this not only cheers me up, but it’s also always managed to get me out of my reading slumps! It’s really consoling to read and it makes me feel so nostalgic!





What’s this book about? I’m sure you all already know!

MAGIC. HARRY. WANDS. HARRY. VOLDEMORT.() HARRY. A SCHOOL OF WIZARDRY. HARRY. GREAT PERIL. HARRY. ENCHANTEMENTS! OOOO WAIT DID I MENTION HARRY? NO…?

*ahem* I’ll now officially begin to write the review!



(for those of you who don’t know of course)

Harry Potter has never known all his life that he’s a wizard. He never knew he was capable of accomplishing magnificent things! But surprise surprise! One day on his eleventh birthday a giant of a man bursts through the door and says, “You’re a wizard Harry!” *gasps* Harry has lived eleven years of his life with his aunt, uncle and their son Dudley who’s a pig (not joking). They made his life miserable by treating him in the worst ways possible! But now he gets to go to Hogwarts to learn magic! (I slightly envy him)

Yeah yeah whatever Hermione!



The plot was stupefying! (forgive my bad humor lol) There is something of great value hidden in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at the moment and Harry and his friends have got a hunch that someone’s going to try and steal it! No wonder the third floor corridor is out of bounds because what you’ll find there is certainly not welcoming! BEWARE! Harry also has to deal with a really powerful wizard who killed his parents! The plot was fast paced and easy to comprehend. The writing was pretty simple too. I didn’t expect the plot twist at all!







Harry Potter is the protagonist (duh). I usually tend to hate the protagonist of a story but Harry’s not bad! He’s got a lightning shaped scar on his forehead which he acquired when a malicious wizard tried to kill Harry when he was a baby but failed to do so! Why couldn’t Voldemort kill Harry? I’m afraid you’re going to have to read this book to find out!




He’s Harry’s sidekick…well not exactly. He’s Harry’s best friend and yeah that sounds better. He comes from a poor but kind hearted family who welcomed Harry and made him feel like he was a part of their family as well. Ron is my personal favorite character in the first book. He’s always supportive of Harry and is willing to stand up for him in any conflict that arises.




Ahhh! Here comes our little Miss-know-it-all! She’s Harry’s best friend as well. She’s always found nagging Harry and Ron to do their homework and concentrate during classes but they don’t really pay attention to her. But she sure does come in real handy if you’re attacked by a perilous creature! You can rely on her for spells!


I love every other character as well, yes even Malfoy! All the characters have very fascinating and disparate traits.

Like I said, Little Miss-know-it-all!

I recommend this book without a doubt to people of all ages. It’s a must read and trust me when I say this that you’ll never find this monotonous. You’re either going to hate it completely or love it!"

I have been meaning to write this to you for a long time now. This isn’t a review on your journey, this is simply my feelings, words I wish I could tell you. I still remember the first time I bought this book, YOUR book. I say first time since I had to buy it again from another publication that actually continued with your books. At the time, I had been without any interesting books to read for months, and your story caught my attention since I had read about your popularity in Britain in a newspaper. I got all excited and bought the book immediately. People barely knew you where I lived and I think I can claim that I was among the first who gave you a chance. Back then, your books weren’t found easily anyway and weren’t published all over the country.

I read your book and I really liked it, but tell you the truth, I wasn’t really in love with your series yet. I did look forward to your second book, and I was disappointed to find out that there were no copies available where I lived and that your third book wasn’t even out yet. I waited and waited and slowly word spread about you and the second copy finally appeared. I read it and... something changed... You see, I was falling in love with your magical world.

Years later, there was a girl in my class that I barely knew. I recommended your story to her, she read it and something changed between the two of us. More than 15 years later, she is still one of my best friends. Just like that, you helped with creating a lasting connection between the two of us. You helped us to find each other, despite the fact that we had been sitting very close for more than a year.

At high school, I used to find school days very boring. Fortunately, I was able to get good grades without paying any real attention during most of my classes. It was a blessing and a curse, certain days were almost unbearable, but then... your world gradually became a part of my world, and daydreaming about you and your world was kind of a life savor. You see, I could think and fantasize about you and your friends, your journey, your future, filling my boredom with magic and mystery. I had the chance to look forward to reading another book in your series during the years, discussing your story in depth with my friends. Time passed and my teenage years were spent with you by my side. When I think back, some of my best memories are the ones you gave me.

Then came a time that almost anyone that read books, knew about you. I stumbled upon a website that had been created by teens in my country and I started to chat with one of the admins. She was both a Harry Potter fan and a Lord of the Rings fan and we connected immediately. I never forget how she kept calling me by mobile phone when my family moved into a new house and I didn't have access to Internet. She would talk to me for hours, helping me to keep my sanity and escape boredom. She moved to Japan a few years ago, and I have very little contact with her these days, but I will always remember her and what she did for me.

Years later, as a university student, I was introduced to a pair of twin sisters. They were very shy at the time, and I didn’t know how to connect with them or whether I even wanted to. One day we were forced to spend some time together, awkwardly trying to fill the silence. We were uncomfortable and lost right before we realized we did have something in common, and it was our love for you! We started talking about you, and slowly found even more interests that we had in common... and to this day, they have remained my best friends, always to being there for me.

So Harry, I want to thank you for letting me into your world, and for becoming a part of my world. Thank you for being there when I needed you. Thank you for giving me these fun and treasured memories. Thank you for helping me find people like me. Thank you for everything. I will always cherish you.

You live forever in my mind and my heart.
Yours sincerely"

وأخيراً اتفكت عقدتي وتصالحت مع هاري بوتر وأنا على مشارف ال 23 سنة 😂💙

في البداية حابه احكي قصة صغيرة عن سبب تأخري في حب بوتر، من وأنا صغيرة كنت دايما بفتح الفيلم في نصه أو آخره وعمري ما فهمت قصته بتدور عن ايه! ومرت السنين وأنا مستغربة ليه الناس ممكن تحب قصة بتتمحور حولين السحر وكائنات اشكلها غريبة بتصيبني بالرعب والاشمئزاز!

ولكن الحمدلله إني اديت لنفسي فرصة وبدأت اقرأ السلسلة و وقعت في حبها من أول صفحة 🥺

××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××

هاري طفل صغير تربى مع خالته بعد وقوع حادث لأبويه أدى إلى وفاتهما، ولكن الزمن لم يحنو عليه وعانى من التفرقة بينه وبين ابن خالته في كل شيء بداية من الطعام والملابس حتى الألعاب وصولاً بأنهم جعلوا مكان نومه تحت السلم مع العناكب 💔
وذات صباح وصلته رسالة تدعوه لبدء عام دراسي جديد في مدرسة السحر! ليتفاجيء بأسرار قديمة تخص عائلته وتغير مصيره إلى الأبد :D


لم أشعر أن فاتني شيء في الطفولة، بل على العكس تماماً شعرت بأني عدت طفلة ذات العشر سنوات أثناء اندماجي بكل تفصيله ذُكرت، بكل مشاعر الصداقة الصادقة، بإحساس النجاح والعوض بعد الشقاء، بالفرحة مع حل كل لغز والترقب الشديد والحماس، بالنهاية الغير متوقعة بالمرة :"") عالم هاري بوتر احتضني بقوة 💙

ومنذ هذه اللحظة، أصبحت هرمايني صديقة لهما .. هناك أشياء عندما يشترك فيها الناس تنتهي بأن يصبحوا أصدقاء، ويبدو أن التغلب على غول جبلي طوله ۱۲ قدما هو أحد هذه الأشياء ..

«هناك أنواع مختلفة من الشجاعة .. هناك شجاعة تحتاجها للوقوف في وجه الأعداء .. لكن ، نحتاج إلى أكثر منها للوقوف في وجه الأصدقاء ؛ لذلك أعطي عشر درجات إلى السيد نيفيل لونجبوتم ! » .

« لقد ماتت أمك لتنقذك .. الشيء الوحيد الذي لا يستطيع فولدمور فهمه هو الحب .. إنه لا يدرك أن حبا قويا كحب أمك لك يترك أثرا .. ليس ندبة ، فعلامته ليست ظاهرة .. فالحب يحوط الإنسان ويحميه إلى الأبد حتى لو رحل الشخص الذي أحبه عن الدنيا .. وهذه الحماية موجودة في جلدك .. وهكذا فإن شخصا مملوءا بالكراهية والحقد والطمع مثل کویریل ) الذي يشارك جسده مع ( فولدمور ) لا يستطيع أن يلمسك..وهو يتألم عندما يلمس شخصا به أثر شيء رائع مثل هذا » .

لقد كانت هذه إحدى المناسبات التي تكون فيها القصة الحقيقية أكثر غرابة وإثارة من أكثر الشائعات جموحا ..

164,165,5,"Megírhatta volna Stephen King is. Ebben a változatban Harry Potter tíz évet lehúz egy gardróbszekrényben, miközben gonosz pótcsaládja minden lehetséges módon bántalmazza és megalázza. (Eddig stimmel.) Aztán Harry egyszer csak ráébred, hogy ő nem akárki, hanem mágus, mi több, a varázslók társadalmának ékköve – olyan hatalom birtokosa, amit felmérni is nehéz. (Még ez is stimmel.) Úgyhogy ki is robban belőle az évtizedes düh meg frusztráció, és egy vérgőzös jelenetben tömegmészárlást rendez a muglik között.

De nem Stephen King írta meg. Illetve megírta, csak Carrie a címe. Ez pedig egy másik könyv. Itt Harry szerencsére összeakad Voldemorttal, helyesebben annak lappangó árnyával, úgyhogy nincs ideje a szörnyű bosszún agyalni. Ráadásul rá kell jönnie, a varázslók is épp olyanok, mint a többi ember: némelyikük ostoba, rosszindulatú, szánalmas, bosszúálló vagy idegesítő, sőt, akad, aki több is egyszerre. Mert a tehetséget - úgy fest - nem érdem alapján osztogatják.

Ez a bölcsek köve, amit minden író keres. A könyv, ami mítosszá növi ki magát, kultikus szereplőket és helyeket szül, nem mellesleg pedig undorítóan gazdaggá teszi kiagyalóját. És Rowling megcsinálta. Nem érdemtelenül. Mert ez a könyv pazarul működik, atmoszférája van, lendületes, szépen felépített, plasztikus. Lángoló érzelmeket képes kelteni olvasójában szereplőivel szemben: Malfoyt például egészen bizonyosan egy emberként pofozná laposra az olvasók kollektív tenyere. És a helyszínek! Például az Abszol út, ahol hordókban áll a denevérlép és az angolnaszem (ilyennek képzelem a vuhani piacot), no és persze a labirintusba meg kísértetkastélyba oltott elitegyetem, Roxfort. A mitikus lények, a dermesztő árnyak, a feszültségek okos adagolása… szóval minden megvan benne, amitől felpezseg az olvasó vére.

Amúgy meg semmi különös, hisz csak arról szól, amiről az összes valamire való kultikus mű a Gyűrűk urától a Star Wars-on át a Marvel univerzumig. Hogy bármekkora muglinak is érzed magad, lehet, te vagy a kiválasztott. De a hőst nem az teszi, hogy kiválasztották. Hanem hogy mihez kezd ezzel."
165,166,5,"Un auténtico despliegue de genialidad creativa.

La primera entrega de la que probablemente sea la saga literaria más importante de la literatura moderna fue, en sus inicios, subestimada por su carácter fantasioso y tachada como pieza infantil.

Sí, el protagonista es un niño, sí, hay brujas, unicornios y dragones, sí, su lenguaje es sencillo. Pero no debe esto restar complejidad a la brillante historia que Rowling crea haciendo alarde de una imaginación mordaz y una habilidad irreprochable para abrir caminos, evocar un universo imposible, entrelazar subtramas y crear una pieza irresistiblemente entretenida que está plagada de detalles que la hacen amplia, original y absorbente sin importar la edad del lector que se aventure entre sus páginas.

Tiene el encanto de la infancia, la adrenalina de una aventura insólita, la calidez de los vínculos que son a la vez inesperados y predestinados, la promesa de un regreso y elementos que, aunque no lo supiéramos entonces, empezaban a cultivar una obra más compleja y oscura que acabaría revolucionando la literatura juvenil de la época."
166,167,5,"How could I not give this book 5 stars? I would live in fear of being strung up the nearest Muggle tree! Thankfully, it was a great book and well deserving of high praise.

Not to mention Harry Potter gives way to this famous Office scene:

Michael Scott: We are going to choose team names. Dwight!
Dwight Schrute: We will be called Gryffindor!
Jim Halpert: Really? Not Slytherin?
Dwight Schrute: Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
Jim Halpert: I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
Dwight Schrute: [fearfully:] He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? I wouldn't do that.
Jim Halpert: [starts chant, everyone joins in:] Voldemort! Voldemort! Voldemort! Voldemort! Voldemort!
Dwight Schrute: [looks around, scared:] Okay, seriously, you really shouldn't be saying that.

Now that's funny."
167,168,5,"I actually really really enjoyed this book. I was never interested in reading or watching the movies as I mainly read and watch romance. I spoke to a few friends and asked if I should give it a go and of course they said yes. I'm so glad I did and I didn't actually think I would like it, but was wrong. Very enjoyable read."
168,169,5,بعد از سال‌ها، دوباره خوندن هری‌پاتر رو اینبار با نسخه زبان اصلیش شروع کردم و دوباره همون دختربچه ۱۰ساله شدم و فرو رفتم توی دنیای شگف‌انگیز هری پاتر. بخش بزرگی از خاطرات کودکی و نوجوانی من با هری‌پاتر شکل گرفته و خیلی خیلی بهش مدیونم.

مع اول صفحة فى الكتاب أصبحت مراهق من جديد
لاعيش اروع مغامرة اى حد ممكن يعيشها و ستظل تبهرنى فى كل مرة اعود اليها كأول مرة ادخل عالم السحر
الجيل اللى بعدى كان حظه ف تويلايت، واللى بعده فى العاب الجوع لكن سيذل جيلنا جيل هارى بوتر اكتر جيل محظوظ بسنين ضوئية :)

بدايتى مع القراءة كانت فى 2009 و لكنى كنت قرات سلسلة هارى بوتر كلها قبلها ب 5 سنين و كنت قرات ما صدر و بدات قراءة اخر 3 اجزاء مع اصدارتهم قبل مشاهدة الافلام فعيشت المغامرة مرتين و لكن ستظل مغامرة القراءة افضل بمراحل خاصة ان اخر 3 افلام طب استقطاع كثير منهم فى الافلام.

وداعا عالم الواقع و الملل و لننتقل لعالم السحر
اهلا بكم فى هوجروتس مدرسة للسحر والشعوذة حيث كل ما هو عجيب من سلالم متحركة، اشباح، صور حية و وحوش بكل انواعها و أيضا رياضة الاكثر شعبية فى عالمهم هو الكويديتش

عالم يبدأ بماساة عن طفل صغير مات أبويه على يد ساحر الظلام ""الذى لا يجب ذكر اسمه"" الذى أيضًا فقد كل قوته عند مهاجمته الطفل الصغير مما خلف ندبه على وجهة على شكل صاعقة برق، الذى بسببها اصبح اشهر ساحر فى العالم

لتبدا مشقة هارى بوتر فى معيشته مع خالته و عائلتها لمدة احدى عشر سنة حتى يتسلم بريد من هاجريد العزيز ليخبره بقبوله فى مدرسة تعليم السحر فى هوجروتس .

لياخذه الى هناك لتبدا الرحلة الممتعة فى عالم السحر

لتبدا مغامرات هارى فى هوجروتس بالتعرف على رون ويزلى صديقة الشجاع صاحب الدم الخفيف صاحب اجمل تعابير على وجهه
و هيرموينى غيرينجر صاحبة اذكى عقل و اطيب قلب التى تعتبر احيانا مثل والدتهم من كتر حذرها عليهم

مثل ما يوجد اصدقاء لابد من وجود اعداء الذى يتمثل فى دراكو مالفوى المغرور
و بروفيسور سناب صاحب الوجه البارد الجليدى الذى يكره هارى بوتر و استهتاره لاسباب شخصية .

اعتقد لا داعى للكلام عن الاحداث لان 99% راى الفيلم او قرأ الكتاب و يعلم مدى روعته
1% الذى لم يقرأ الكتاب او لم يرى الفيلم لابد مع اختطافه و الذهاب به الى ازكابان

الرواية ممتعة ساحرة
ما يميزها اكثر انك تعيش مغامرة كاملة و قصص قصيرة بجانب القصة الرئيسية من تنافس على جوائز بين الاربعة بيوت

بها كثير من الدروس و ان كان اهمها الصداقة و الشجاعة

الجزء الاول بين الفيلم و الرواية تغييرات طفيفة لم تؤثر بشكل كبير و لكن ستظل رو\عة القراءة افضل بكثير
الان لابد ان ارحل الى حجرة الاسرار لاستكمال المغامرة :)

It's Good to back teenager again xD

Farewell Muggles world , its Wizard Time <3 Harry Potter World

It Teach us Many Lessons and many great Things we need in this world .

Time to go Discover The Chamber Of Secrets Again , Adventure here i come xD"
171,172,5,"About: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone is a children’s fiction novel written by J.K. Rowling. It was published on 6/26/1997 by Arthur A. Levine Books, an imprint of Scholastic Press, 320 pages. The genres are fantasy, young adult, magic, adventure, etc. There are 7 books to this series in this order: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The author also wrote an adult contemporary mystery series which I have yet to read.

“Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.” p297

My Experience: This is my second time reading Harry Potter and I read it with a group of Harry Potter fans. Our group name is called HPBloggateers because all of us are bloggers too. There are 6 of us, Stephanie @ TeacherofYA, Tiffany @ Tiff the Book Nerd , Megan @ Bookslayer Reads, Sammi @ One Bookish Girl, Jodie @ For the Novel Lovers, and myself. We are from USA, UK, and Australia. We started reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone on 2/4/17 and finished it at different days. I finished it on 2/12/17. We scheduled to read 2 chapters a day, but some of us finished early and we’ll not be naming any names, ahem! Megan! Excuse me.. I must have cough a little loud. We have had a lot of fun chatting about books among other things.

“To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.” p299

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone is a great read. It’s a better experience for me reading it the second time around and also after seeing the movie. I compare the book to the movie a lot and I’m impressed at how close the movie was to the book and admired how very good the actors were. I love this first book. The world building is awesome and I enjoy when the author introduce each new character and each new scene. The plot and the characters flow smoothly. I enjoy reading the adventures and mysteries. I love the introduction to magic, entering the train station platform 9 and 3/4, walking down Diagon Alley, the sorting hat, and my most favorite of all is Harry Potter discovering his natural talent for riding the broomstick.

“The truth. It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.” p298

I don’t condone kids breaking school rules to sneak around and involve themselves in other people’s business because I am a rule follower. However, reading this book, I realized that students who breaks the rules are ones to have a lot more fun and exposed to a lot more things than those who follow the rules. If Harry Potter didn’t get detention, he wouldn’t have seen a centaur or a unicorn. Reading this book teach me to loosen on rules a little more and I appreciate the way Dumbledore’s way of discipline. He knows everything that goes on, even students breaking rules, and yet, he allows them to try. This book shows us adults another way of parenting/disciplining curious kids. This book definitely deserve multiple readings.

Pro: magic, plot & characters, adventures, adrenaline rush, page turner, fast paced, couldn’t put down, humor, easy to read, mysteries,

Con: none

I rate it 5 starts!

***Disclaimer: Finally reading a book I own!!

173,174,5,"Decided to do a re-read of the entire Harry Potter series (mostly because I'm beginning to miss the series and wanted to bring it back to life in my mind - not that it ever left; I've just been focusing on other things), and I managed to read this book in just under three hours. As I found when I was younger, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and just simply couldn't put it down. Even though I knew exactly what was going to happen, I still found my heart pounding at every significant event. When Harry first saw the castle, I found my eyes welling up because of nostalgic feelings and I couldn't quite let them go throughout the entirety of the book. Despite how I have picked up more differences between the book and the movie than I did when I read it a few years back, I can still say that the book is tons better. I just love how J.K Rowling has introduced us into the world of Hogwarts; and along with the characters telling Harry everything about the world, we have also been told about it too - and I find it amazing how she has grasped me once again into the series, and I find myself loving it even more than before! (How is that even possible? ;))
If you haven't read this series before, please do. You won't regret it. Despite how this is said a lot, I'm going to say it anyway: this series has really changed my life. It shaped me as a person, and has really influenced the person who I am today.

Overall, fantastic. Nothing to pick at, for me!
Thanks for reading! :)"
174,175,5,"You can read more of my reviews at Queen of Contemporary

I cannot believe that I’ve waited this long to read this series. I’ve had this on my shelf since January but still haven’t bothered to pick it up until now. I am so angry with myself because I should have read them ages ago, especially as it’s now one of my favourite books of all time! We first meet Harry when he is eleven years old. I don’t normally read books with protagonists as young as that but it really worked with the third person narration. Harry is treated appallingly by his aunt and uncle, them favouring his cousin Dudley. In their eyes, Dudley can do no wrong.

One of the best things about this book was the world building. I immersed myself in the wizarding world and felt so comfortable learning about it. I loved Diagon Alley and Hogwarts. The depth that Rowling has gone to to create such a world is amazing. I was blown away by the attention to detail.
I loved all of the characters. Even the ones you’re supposed to hate (Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle etc.) did something to me and they’re such an important part of the story. And I love Hagrid. And Dumbledore. And Professor McGonagall. AND GINNY WEASLEY! I’ve even named my guinea pig after her!

I’ve already started reading the rest in the series and they get better and better. I definitely know why so many people have raved about them because THEY NEED TO BE RAVED ABOUT."

The world building is so structured and unique there is still almost nothing compared to it in 2019.

177,178,5,"Full review…

5 Stars.

This is the easiest 5 stars I’ve given a book. Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s Stone combines a magical and mystical story full of enchantment, a group of inseparable friends, the amazing world of ‘Hogwarts’ and an evil and omnipotent villain in ‘Voldemort’.



I know it’s been a long time coming, but I finally could no longer put off reading the magical world that J.K. Rowling have created out of pure love.

One can never ‘force’ and will himself/herself to create a master literary work, or a musical piece that will last generations to come. Beethoven wrote his most poignant work in his 9th and last Symphony when he was nearly deaf and destitute. An example in sports, Michael Jordan was told by multiple coaches he could never be ‘great’, he was even cut from his high school basketball Varsity team! Six NBA championships later, he is perhaps the greatest basketball player who’s ever lived. The list of examples just goes on…


The literary masterpiece created by JK Rowling was certainly done against all odds. Based on multiple interviews, before reaching stratospheric fame, ‘Joanne’ Rowling had the idea of Harry Potter during a train ride. At the time, just like divine intervention, she promptly started writing her ideas on a ‘napkin’, so as not to forget any details. In reality she was broke, and needing government assistance. She was a single mother, with little to no income, and would go to coffee shops (and take her infant child), while writing for hours on pen and paper. After completing the first draft of 'HPSS', she was rejected by multiple publishers. They would say her work was very ‘childish’, and had a limited audience.





Harry Potter and the beloved series are universally loved because of so many things J.K Rowling did right! Apart from being an orphan, he’s not jaded and angry at the world. His humble nature is an inspiration and a magnet to other good-hearted kids around him. He ends up living with relatives who are jealous of him and despise him, yet he’s still well humored and kind to others.

His ascension during his ‘magic’ training is impressive, yet he remains grounded and friendly to his peers. He’s brave and somewhat impulsive, but those traits are quite endearing as he often acts on a whim to save his friends and protect the ones he loves! J.K Rowling does a wonderful job in character building and description. Even before the movies came out, Potter’s boyish looks, ruffled hair and ‘half-moon glasses’ were literally engraved in people’s mind.






J.K. Rowling's ability to tell a simple yet magical fable, make this such a timeless masterpiece. is an awesome part of the Potter’s world! Every detailed description of a ‘castle’ like University. From the ‘Great hall’, where the entire student body eats in long big wooden tables, and the ceiling would ‘open up to the heavens’; the way Hogwarts is subdivided into 4 different houses, and each student is selected by a ‘magical sorting hat’! Every tiny detail reminds us that Potter and his friends are attending a magic school where wizards are born, and legends will thrive.


Other honorable mentions include the amazing ‘magic system’, and different classes where students learn different magic spells, transfiguration, broom-flying lessons and so much more! Needless to say the ‘supporting’ cast in Potter’s world is an essential ingredient to the HP formula! Harry’s friendship with Hermione and Ron, his admiration for headmaster Dumbledore, and his mistrust for professor Snape all make this a very organic and dynamic read.


The more I kept reading, the more I wanted to immerse myself in the world of Harry Potter. The story flows very naturally and the progression of Harry’s life as an orphaned child to him becoming a famous wizard is addictive and entertaining! The writing is rather simple; JK Rowling does not impress with difficult or lyrical prose. Yet, at the same time she’s just as effective with very vivid description of characters, ghosts, trolls and the evil Voldemort.


I’d be remiss, if I forgot to mention how The Illustrations are made by ‘Jim Kay’, and were personally selected by Rowling herself! In the ‘kindle in motion’ edition, the Illustrations actually move organically giving the story a Magical feeling!"
178,179,5,"I've read this half a million times and everyone and their mum has read it too, so I wasn't going to review it, but I do have a few things that I feel like bitching about because I can't help myself and I hate Dumbledore.

Firstly. How cruel can Dumbledore be to let the Slytherins get excited about winning the house cup only to award Gryffindor 170 points, putting them in the lead by 10 points? And stripping away all that excitement for the Slytherins? That's straight up cold-hearted, considering most of them are CHILDREN and it's something they work for and look forward to the entire school year.

And secondly, Dumbledore is a straight up asshole for enabling the golden trio to end up where they did in the last 2 chapters. They're ELEVEN years old. And for some reason this wrinkly, old idiot thinks it's a good idea to put them in danger to what? Learn a life lesson? Sorry, not on my watch."

تبدأ حكاية بطلنا الذي كان مُقدر له أن يصبح بطلاً منذ أن كان طفلاً صغيراً لا يفقه شيئاً.. فذلك الطفل تمكن من القضاء على أحد أعظم السحرة الأشرار -أنت تعرف من- وهو حينها لم يستطع حتى أن ينطق أول كلماته.
ولكن -أنت تعرف من- قتل أمه وأباه فأصبح بلا عائلة.. فاهتم به بعض السحرة الأخيار مثل ""البروفيسور دمبلدور"" و ""الأستاذة ماكجونجال"" و ""هاجريد"" ذلك الضخم الذي أحتل مكانة في قلوبنا بنفس ضخامته.
وقاموا بتسليمه لعائلة من العامة لتقوم برعايته حتى يدخل إلى مدرسة السحرة ""هوجوورتس"" يُمكنكم أن تشاهدوا كيف انقلبت حياة هاري بوتر 180 درجة، فبعد أن كان مُضطهد مكروه في بيت عائلته المتبقية.. ذهب إلى ""هوجوورتس"" ليصبح مشهوراً وحتى قبل أن يفعل أي شيء.. فيكفي ما فعله وهو لا يعرف كيف فعله!

تبدأ بداية السحر الحقيقية عندما ذهب ""هاري"" و ""هاجريد"" لحارة دياجون ليشتروا مُتطلبات المدرسة.. سنتعرف على بنك ""جرينجوتس"" للسحرة وأنواع العصا السحرية والبوم والكُتب الذي سيستخدمها ""هاري"" وتوجد هنا إشارة لسلسة كُتب ""رولينج"" الجديدة ""الوحوش المُذهلة وأين تجدهم"".
يدخل ""هاري"" إلى المدرسة بعد رحلة غريبة وشيقة من رصيف 9 وثلاثة أرباع ثم استقلاله للقطار وهنا نجد أول لقاء للثلاثي ""هاري"" و ""رون"" و ""هيرمايني"" ذلك الثلاثي الذي سيصبح محور كُل الأحداث.

عند وصوله إلى ""هوجوورتس"" يجد ""هاري"" أن عليه أن يدخل إلى أحد منازل المدرسة الأربعة وهم ""جريفندور"" و ""هافلباف"" و ""رافينكلو"" و ""سليذرين"".. ونرى إصرار ""هاري"" على أن يتجنب منزل ""سيلذرين"" عند إخباره لقبعة التنسيق ""ليس سليذرين.. ليس سليذرين"" وذلك لأن هذا المنزل مكروه جداً وكان قد دخله عدوه الذي حاول قتله -أنت تعرف من- وعدوه الجديد ""دراكو مالفوي"" والتي بدأت عداوتهما سريعاً.

ونأتي لأكثر لعبة شعبية في عالم السحرة وهي ""الكويدتش"" التي توازي كُرة القدم عندنا ن��ن العامة!
يتكون فريق ""الكويدتش"" من 7 لاعبين: حارس و 3 مطاردون وضاربين وباحث.. ومثل والده ""جيمس بوتر"" سيُصبح ""هاري"" باحث أيضاً.
هناك 3 أنوع للكُرات في ""الكويدتش"": الكوافل، والبلادجر، والسنيتش (الكُرة الذهبية) والباحث الذي يتمكن من الإمساك بها يفوز فريقه ب 150 نقطة وغالباً ما تنتهي المباراة بعدها.

هل انبهرت؟ هل تشعر أنه بالجمال والسحر والمُتعة؟ هل تعتقد أن ذلك كافي؟
ولكن لحظنا السعيد، فلم تعتقد ""رولينج"" بأن ذلك كافي..
هاري ورون وهيرمايني.. بُحبهم للمُغامرة الذي دائماً ما يقودهم إلى العديد من المشاكل.. يقودهم حماستهم وبرائتهم إلى صراع مع الأستاذ ""سنايب"" الذي ظنوا فيه كُل الظنون السيئة.. حتى أنهم أعتقدوا أنه حاول أن يُسقط ""هاري"" من فوق مكنسته في أحدى المباريات..
في آثناء أحدى مُغامراتهم، ذهبوا إلى الدور المُحرم.. الدور الثالث.. وعرفوا لماذا هو مُحرم بالطبع.. فهناك وجدوا كلب ضخم بثلاثة رؤوس.. يحمي شيئاً ما وبعد الكثير من البحث.. عرفوا أنه يحمي حجر الفلاسفة الذي صنعه ""نيكولاس فلاميل"" ذلك الحجر الذي يُمكن أن يجعل -أنت تعرف من- يعود إلى الحياة مرة أخرى.. وأعتقدوا أن ""سنايب"" يُريد حجر الفيلسوف لهذا السبب.. ولكنه لم يكن ""سنايب"" أبداً.. أبداً.
فقرروا أن يخوضوا تلك المُغامرة بعدما عرفوا أن الحجر في خطر.. وكان عليهم أن يمروا بالتالي..

""فلافي الكلب ذو الثلاث رؤوس ""وتكفلت به زمارة هاجريد.
ثم ""نبات مخالب الشيطان"" وتكفلت به ""الدحيحة"" هيرمايني.
ثم بعض الطيور التي علي شكل مفاتيح.. وتكفل بها الباحث ""هاري""
ثم ""شطرنج السحرة"" والتي كاد أن يموت فيها ""رون"" بسبب تضحيته فيها..
ثم وجدوا ""غول"" مقتول.. ثم إلى السبع زجاجات وأي اختيار خاطئ قد يؤدي إلى وفاتهم في الحال..
حتى وصل ""هاري"" وحيداً إلى آخر غُرفة.. ومن كان بها كان مفاجاًة ولم يكن ""سنايب"" كما كان متوقع!

كان الأستاذ ""كويريل"" صاحب العمة الغريبة والتي فهمنا لماذا يلبسها دائماً.. فبدل من أن تري مؤخرة رأسه.. سترى رأس -أنت تعرف من- ليُصبح ذو وجهين.. يحاول -أنت تعر�� من- أن يحصل على حجر الفيلسوف ليعود إلى الحياة وهيئته البشرية إلى حداً ما مرة أخرى.. ولكن تصدى له ""هاري"" وقاومه.

أرأيت؟ تلك الرواية قمة في المُتعة والجمال.. رغم أني حاولت وحاولت أن أذكر كُل التفاصيل.. كُل تلك الإنبهارات مثل ""مرآة أريسيد"" و ""العباءة السحرية"" وووو.. لم أستطع.. تلك رواية لا بُد أن تُقرأ حتى تشعر بما شعرنا به.. حتى تفهم ذلك الجمال والشغف الذي سيجعلك تتعلق بأبطال الرواية
سيعود -أنت تعرف من- مرة أخرى.. وحينها يجب أن يكون هاري وأصدقائه حذرين.. لأن المُغامرة القادمة في حُجرة أسرار!"

Harry -- yer a wizard.

I was deeply impressed of how J.K. Rowling manages to still whisk me away to my childhood when I took up my broken spined version for a buddy read! 🧙🏼‍♀️
You just feel the fun the author had while writing this book! Mild surprise to see how whimsical and like the first chapters are in Englishness, satirizing the perfectly decent Dursleys (), especially if you know how dark the tone of is.

Hogwarts in the first chapters is just magical to return to, with Hermione being an insufferable know it all () till mountain troll bonding is there for the win.
And then we have Draco - I'll tell my father - Malfoy as douchy nemesis, Neville with his troubled history and clumsiness () and Snape already sometimes being mentioned as having the uncanny ability to read minds.

Had some qualms that you can just fly to Hogwarts on a broom like Charlies friends did and you do wonder why Alohomora works on a secret door enchanted by Dumbledore himself.
But those are minor things compared to the brilliance of concepts as the mirror of Erised (Rowling let's Dumbledore think the following about the mirror: ), the invisibility cloak, the sorting hat or quidditch.

Loved it!

""It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.”

~~ A.D.



I could never imagine loving a book as much the second time around, yet here I am.

















When I review a book, basically I'm breaking it up into little pieces, placing the parts into neat little boxes, and ending my journey with that particular world. It's bittersweet at times because I want to share my journey with everyone, but in doing so, I get sucked back into the real world I was in before I read the book.

In this case, I refuse to do that. I am keeping all the feelings this book gave me, all the , to myself. If you want some of your own, you'll have to go out and get it yourself. I'm not ready to let mine go. Not just yet.

















That's where I'm heading."
187,188,5,"There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
At this point, you’ve either read the Harry Potter series, or you’ve deliberately chosen not to read them. Either way, there’s not much to say here.

Of course, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone is the foundation for the series, and it does a brilliant job of presenting a story that seems complete upon a first reading. Indeed, unlike so many other first books in a series, it works just as well as a stand-alone book. Yet, as you progress in the series, you are shown the layers, the depth, and how many small details in this first book get fleshed out and built upon. It is truly impressive world-building and storytelling.

The author may have let people down later in her life; people sometimes suck more than you realize at first. But the series is an achievement that will outlast her and all of us. 5 stars because I can't give it 6. And if somehow you've stubbornly refused to read it, you are really missing out."
188,189,5,"It's impossible not to date myself through this review, but I first read Harry Potter when I was young enough to wish for a Hogwarts letter of my own. I'm now rereading the exact same hardcovers that I bought as they were released, mostly because my mother is a saint and mailed them all to me in San Francisco:



I'm rereading this book while drinking a glass of wine (HA!!), and on this pass I really think it's the optimal children's book. It opens an entire world while still following a compact, interesting plot, and it makes me laugh on every single page. It's amazing that the Dumbledore who says, at the first feast, ""Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!"" can be the same person as the Dumbledore of the rest of the series, but somehow that is believable and wonderful.

5/5 this book made me cry happy tears but maybe it was the alcohol"
189,190,5,"5 stars

So I've re-read Harry many times and in many different editions. But by far the latest edition is my favourite. I already have the box set edition and the hardback illustrated edition which is absolutely beautiful and a must for any serious fan and now I got the eBook illustrated edition. Which has all the illustrations from the hardback plus a few more and they move! So it's really a gif edition and I'm a complete sucker for it. If you love carrying Harry with you everywhere there's no edition more enchanting than this one to keep close at all times."
190,191,5,"Reread, September 2012. Every time I read this book, it delights me all over again. There's nothing like it, accept no substitutes. Rowling has given the world a tremendous gift.

January 2016: Read the kids the illustrated edition aloud. They loved it. Boy had read it before, of course, but it was Baby Girl's first time, and she was hooked. The one drawback to reading it aloud is bawling through Hagrid giving Harry the album of pictures of his parents, and through Neville getting 10 points for Gryffindor."
191,192,5,"Audiolibro

Nunca en la vida pensé que me fuera a gustar Harry Potter, es la primera vez que lo leo y nunca vi sus películas, pero ya las tengo en agenda, luego de leer los libros. Me ha gustado mucho, y más aún escucharlo en audiolibro, ya que contaba con efectos de sonido. Una historia muy entretenida. J.K Rowling sabe cómo atrapar al lector sin importar si es niño o adulto."
192,193,5,"تا این لحظه هیچ‌موقع فرصت خوندن نسخه‌ی چاپی هری‌‌پاتر رو نداشتم و الان بعد از تموم شدن جلد اول اعتراف میکنم خودمو وسط صفحه‌های کتاب جا گذاشتم از بس قشنگ بود:"")"
193,194,5,"I couldn't even begin to count how many times I've read this book, yet, somehow, every time I read it I notice something new. Obviously, the entire series deserves five stars for the nostalgia alone. It makes me so happy to read these same lessons over and over, and they have never lost any value or meaning just because I grew up. The vast majority of my life has been filled with Harry Potter. This is truly a classic, the likes of which I doubt will ever be seen again. I do notice, now that I'm older, that the first book was definitely directed at a young audience. It's still very well-written, but as the characters mature in the rest of the series, so does the writing. I love watching that development, and I think it is even more useful in allowing the reader to grow up with the characters as the tone becomes older and darker. I just need to add that reading the illustrated edition is such a delightful experience, and I definitely recommend it. It adds even more magic to a beautiful beginning to the series."
194,195,5,"I should have read this book AGES ago.

So magical."
195,196,5,"It has been ten years since I first read Harry Potter. And it has been ten years I have spent basking in the wondrous glory of books. And it has been ten years I have spent cherishing J.K. Rowling’s words close to my hearts. And it has been ten years I haven’t thanked the one woman responsible for introducing me to the joy of the reading world.

So Dear JK,
This is my heartfelt thank you to you.

I had a huge, HUGE reading slump during my childhood. I went from reading everything I could get my hands on to thinking reading was “too nerdish” and “boring” and that’s saying a lot consider I was a nerd throughout my life due to my glasses XD
I started small in O’2, with those Sweet Valley books, just because our teachers urged us to read so much. Then one day, it happened. I wanted to read Harry Potter because everyone around me was reading it. And it was 2008 so all parts had already been released. I had barely seen the few HP movies that had come out by then. So I went to the bookstore, bought the entire series in one go (except for book 1, which I already had because of English class), came home, and well, I have never stopped reading since.
And I am not joking when I say Harry Potter literally got me to start reading books and adore them as I do now.
As someone who has suffered from Migraines their whole life, I knew what head-splitting pain can feel like. And that was the first thing that jumped at me from the Harry Potter books. That pain he described, that searing pain in his forehead. That was the first time I connected to the Boy Who Lived.
It gave birth to years of obsession, years of collecting Harry Potter posters, staying up at night to read the last part in the cold winters, literally dreaming about being at Hogwarts and studying there, and making loads of friends through our mutual love for this series. And I won’t have it any other way.
Harry Potter Series was, is, and forever will be the books that have made me love, hate, grieve, feel, think and hope more than anything else in the world.

And while that may not be much for a lot of people, it’s everything for me.

Before the review, I’d like to give a special mention to my reading partners (most of whom :P and some of whom I’ve come to know a bit through our chitchats in Anish’s review thread ^_^ and one idiot I know far too well :D)








And LAST but NOT the Least:


And Finally:




You think right, Dear Ron!














































And it is these moments I cherish that most and it is these moments that have the power to lighten up a child’s day, regardless of how bleak it is.
And for that, and for much more, I will always send my deepest gratitude to J.K Rowling.

P.S Special shoutout to the one and only
You are the biggest idiot. Never change that. :)

I can't believe it's been 15 years since I last touched these pages. ""It was the best [re-read of my] life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls . . . [I will] never, ever forget."""
197,198,5,"I read the illustrated version! Wow! The images are absolutely breathtaking and add so much detail to the story. I have never read the full series before, so I am very excited to read them all now! This world is so magical and the characters and story really come to life! I am a huge fan of the movies, but the books take the magic to a whole other level!"

199,200,5,"What is there to say about these books that hasn’t already been said? There is a reason why the world of Harry Potter is loved globally. I decided that I needed the wistful life of the wizarding world to help warm my heart during these hard times.

Simply put, Hogwarts feels like coming home. I felt my heart aching as the book ended. I didn’t want to come back to reality, away from the safety and comfort of Hogwarts.

I read the MinaLima edition this time. It is absolutely the most stunning book I have ever read. The illustrations and interactive parts added another level of magic. I would definitely recommend this edition to any Harry Potter fans!"
200,201,5,"“It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.”

Dear J.K. Rowling,
It doesn't matter how many times I read Harry Potter, it always amazes me more than the last time I read it. Whenever I read it I always ponder about how did you manage to create such an enchanting world."
201,202,5,"Can I just say how good the world that J.K. Rowling has created is marvelous?
I have loved every bits of this one again even though it's not my first time reading it.
I like how the bond was created after the ogre attack to finally leading to our main battle.
I just wish this wasn't a children's book but an adult or mature book so that it could be longer, more darker and bloodier/gory."

206,207,5,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone or Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?
Rilettura in inglese con il gruppo “Edicola & Libreria: le nostre passioni…”
È estremamente difficile commentare per la prima volta un libro che si è letto e riletto più volte, e ogni volta l’hai amato più della precedente.
Per cui sul contenuto in se stesso ho ben poco da dire: è semplicemente fantastico, ed ogni volta accende la sua magia facendoti tornare bambino e vorresti, con tutto il cuore, essere lì a vivere assieme a Harry & C. le sue avventure ^^
Ci sono dei punti particolarmente commoventi e quasi tutti hanno a che fare con Harry e il suo essere solo.
Ovviamente finito il libro, vorresti subito passare a quello successivo ^^
Sono estremamente soddisfatta di questa lettura anche per un altro motivo. Dovendo rileggerlo per l’ennesima volta (oramai ho perso il conto ^^) ho deciso di cimentarmi con la versione originale; l’ho trovata molto scorrevole ed è stato veramente piacevole scoprirne la terminologia.
La prima sorpresa è il nome dei Tassorosso: 😍 ma quant’è bello? In italiano non ha la stessa resa.
Poi ci sono i Muggles ovvero i babbani e, sorprendentemente, nell’Oxford dictionary sul kindle è proprio specificato come terminologia inventata dalla Rowling.
Non ci avevo mai fatto caso ma, nell’elenco dei libri che Harry deve acquistare per il suo anno scolastico c’è anche Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
Infine l’ultimo appunto è per la mia domanda inziale: a libro finito ho scoperto che stavo leggendo Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 😲 ovvero la versione Usa (mentre leggevo, ogni volta che incappavo in sorcerer, infatti mi chiedevo il perché). A quanto pare, l’editore Usa, ha deciso che la parola philosopher era troppo ostica per i piccoli lettori statunitensi (😭) e per renderla più appetibile ai loro lettori, la storia doveva essere in qualche modo americanizzata, da qui sono state fatte diverse modifiche, tra cui quella del titolo.
Purtroppo queste cose succedono spesso e, secondo me, sono un insulto all’intelligenza dei lettori di tutto il mondo: siamo più svegli di quanto ci reputino! 😠

EDIT 14/09/23
Devo evitare qualsiasi contatto con i film perchè se no mi scatta la frenesia di rileggere"

The world which Rowling created is so exceptional and captivating that I felt as if I were there with the characters, wearing the Invisibility Cloak and watching them with my own eyes! Magic, magic is everywhere! I loved how she described and introduced every single character and place in the story. Moreover, I thought the way she brought inanimate objects to life was brilliant! I have never seen anything like that! Truly, her imagination is just incredible, and the more I read, the more I come to appreciate it! It is fair to say that everything was well-written and creative.

Now, as a Gryffindor, I have got to say that I'm so happy and pleased with how this one ended! It left me with many questions as well, but I'm sure I will get my answers at some point. There are a lot of things that I'm curious aboutーmost of all, the Forbidden Forest. I'm so eager to know more about Rowling's fascinating world in the next books.

From Harry’s awful living arrangements with the Dursley’s to the hope of exciting days to come with an unexpected letter on his birthday, it’s easy to want Harry to succeed from day one.

Whilst the trip to London Zoo also shows that this series can blend the magical in a recognisable setting perfectly.

The world building is incredible as iconic elements like the sorting hat, the four houses and Quidditch are introduced.

Somehow my original review has disappeared from Goodreads but having read this multiple times this story is engrained in my mind.
These books are not only great reads, but helped shaped a generation of kids like myself into avid readers."

لا أذكر في أي صف دراسي كنت حين رأيت هاري بوتر لأول مرة، كانت صورة الفتى الصغير بنظاراته المستديرة وصديقه أحمر الشعر والعجوز ذي اللحية الطويلة البيضاء والبوم والعصي السحرية تملأ علب التلوين والدفاتر والأقلام. عرفت بأن اسمه هاري بوتر وبأن هناك سلسلة أفلام وكتب ذلك. ولست أذكر أيضاً متى شاهدت الفيلم للمرة الأولى، انبهرت به جداً وأحببته كثيراً، وبقيت أتابعه حتى الجزء الخامس. وكنت أنوي قراءة السلسلة كاملة لكني تخوفت من أن تخذلني لغتي الإنجليزية كون الرواية تُصنّف في مجال الفانتازيا والسحر والمغامرات. وبذلك تأجّل مشروع قرائتها إلى أجل غير مسمّى، إلى أن تم إصدار النسخة الصوتية للترجمة العربية على تطبيق ستوريتل مؤخّراً، وفرحت بها كثيراً.

هاري بوتر ورونالد ويزلي وهيرميون غرانجر، أصبحوا فعلاً أصدقاء وخير الأصدقاء.

حاول فولدمورت أن يعود إلى الحياة من خلال الحصول على حجر الفيلسوف المُخبّأ في المدرسة، لكن هاري بوتر منعه في الوقت المناسب. وهذا يترك الباب مفتوحاً لاحتمالات خطيرة في المستقبل! فهل يجد فولدمورت أعواناً جدداً يساعدونه في العودة والانتقام من هاري؟

Loved reading this book for the second time and having the illustrated version be the edition to experience it all again. Rowling is such a master storyteller. Not many writers have achieved creating such beloved characters. The illustrations were beautiful and that close to ending scene with Dumbledore is perfection. So much love and detail was put into these unique characters.

Hagrid, I will always love you."
215,216,5,"i've officially read my first Harry Potter book! woohoo! obviously, i had to give it 5 stars - it's such an engaging story with such exceptional characters. i can't believe i waited so long to start this series!! i'm so thrilled to have finally picked it up. Potter fandom, here i come."
216,217,5,"A whimsical, entertaining introduction into one the most beloved series of time. Loved it!"
217,218,5,"It was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter. I'd heard some comment here and there even before of the first film from some acquaintances and I had the general knowledge that it was becoming a phenomenon, but still I didn't feel compelled to read the books. I've been reader all my life but I don't know, I was kinda undecided about it. Then, the films came out, and I started to watch them, and still I wasn't eager to read the books, since I thought, hey, I am watching the films, so what may I am losing about the story (oh boy! how wrong I was!). I had some good surprises because I wasn't reading the books like in the third movie. When I watched the fourth film, , I was commenting it with a friend that he was reading the books on Spanish and he told me enough stuff that was in the fourth book it was missed on the fourth film that I decided then to read the books. Oddly enough while my friend was been reading the books on Spanish, he had an edition on English of the first book, this one, and since by then I already was reading on English, he lent me the book. Usually I am quite reluctant to borrow books or that people lent me books. I had some bad experiences borrowing books and while I am dependable and careful about stuff that it's not mine, still I don't want to have books, etc... that are not mine under my care. Still, my friend insisted and he told me that he was glad that somebody read the book since he bought it in an impulse thinking that he would read it but he aborted the mission and he prefer to read on Spanish. Since I wasn't SO convinced to read the books, I ended accepting the offer of that he lent me the book. I started to reading it... Right in the first pages, when Hagrid mentioned lent him out the flying motorcycle!!! Keep on mind that I already watched 4 films by then, so reading the identity of the real owner of the motorcycle, mentioned in so casual way and right in the beginning of the saga! Then, I knew that J.K. Rowling was a wicked genius!!! And this first book kept me surprising me even when I was already reading the fifth book, since certain character that appears in the first book, then I said ""Oh, boy, what a boring chapter, why did J.K. bothered to create such unimportant character?"" and I was starting to read the fifth book and... ""Mmh... where I heard about this character before...where?...mmmh...OH MY GOODNESS!!! NO!!! IT CAN'T BE!!!"". By then, I had returned the borrowed book but I had bought my own copy for the collection and I consulted it and POW! Yes, it was the same character!!! Right in the first book!!! So, re-confirmed like for the umpteenth time... J.K. Rowling is a wicked genius!!! I enjoyed a lot reading the first book. J.K. Rowling has a very interesting style of writing. Also, the first book is very good combining the magical world with the normal things that people has to do when kids are beginning school. Going to buy the school supplies. Having to deal different kind of teachers. Some good, some strict, some both. The forming of friendships with schoolmates. Indeed a wonderful and magical book. Highly recommended."
218,219,5,"I've just noticed that I've never written a review for my very first book and my very favorite book. I read this when I was in fourth grade. it was 2005. I've never heard of Harry Potter before. this new mall just opened up and mom, my older brother and I went there. as we walked around, my brother and mom got into a fight about his school grades. mom stopped by this small bookstore. she went in to buy magazines. I waited outside, at the time bookstores meant nothing to me, she came out with an Arabic translation of the Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone for my brother. she wanted him to better his reading skills. he lost interest in the book within an hour or so. I grabbed the book from where he kept it on his desk. I ended up reading the book 17 times!! it was the only book I had and I didn't know that squeals existed XD. I never told my best friends at school about the book that fascinated me so much. I don't know why I never did. I guess I wanted to keep it as a secret for myself lest I spoiled its magic
after a few months, I lost interest in the book and I never read again until my second year at middle school I was at a very unhappy place in my life back then.
I went to this supermarket that had the same bookstore that I bought the first book from. I went in and I found the second, third, fourth and fifth and sixth book in the Arabic translation. I was tremendously overjoyed! I bought them all and took my time reading them afterward I bought the movies' DVD. during that same year the last book came out but I had to wait for it until it came in the Arabic translation and I got it a year after. I read the last book in 2 weeks. it was the fastest read for me back then. after I finished this amazing series I decided I want to write. I imagined authors as gods. they could create their own worlds and people and could make those people do whatever they want. I thought of them as superpowers.I wrote 2 novels and made my stepmom read one of them and she said it was really good. the laptop I wrote them in had misfunctioned and I lost all I've written. I never wrote again after that but I had fallen in love with the Fantasy Genre and there weren't Arab author that wrote Fantasy YA novels and no books were translated in Arabic unless they were extremely popular like the Harry Potter. so I decided to learn English and learn it so well so I can read all the fantasy books out there. and I did.
Thank you, J K rowling. I owe you a lot"
219,220,5,"Once every year, I drown into a sea of mingled feelings that leaves me in the mood to read nothing at all, and so I always pick up a favorite, Harry Potter never fails me.
It's a world I never want to leave, I want to stay there and live there if I could.

UPDATE AFTER SECOND READ

Very beautiful, this time I didn't gulp it down at once, I took my time with it as I'm going through a mild reading slump, and as I also wanted to savour it more than I did last time.
J.K Rowling did an amazing job with the world of wizardry, the characters, the school and every detail, she made Hogwarts the dream school of a whole generation, and that cannot be achieved easily by everyone.

I never thought I'd get excited for a fantasy book, but Harry Potter along with some other standalones and series made me appreciate the world of the fantastic and what it does to our imagination, how much it helps us withstand reality.

I think one thing I don't like about this book is how the other houses were overshadowed and never once mentioned or involved in the course of action. Otherwise, everything about it is absolutely perfect.

--------------------------------------------

*ALERT*
As all the time, this is just me ranting about how I feel after reading this.
Well, guess who just joined the Harry Potter fans! It's MEEE..
I mean I was determined on not reading the Harry Potter series, but friends of mine really urged me to go for it, and I did.. And would do it all over again.
The writing style is amazing, Rowling is fabulous in her ability to create a whole entire new world with all of its components is just fascinating. The description moves you right into the book and lets you feel every little detail yourself.
I just cannot wait to read the rest of the series."
220,221,5,"Popsugar reading challenge 10. Un bestseller de la década de 1990

La primera vez que leí estos libros fue entre los 13 y los 15 años, tenía un buen recuerdo de ellos, aunque confieso que Harry Potter como personaje nunca me ha gustado xd pero bueno, la historia y todos los demás personajes tienen un mayor valor para mí. Esta relectura es porque nunca leí el 7mo, en ese entonces no estaba en la biblioteca y todavía no conocía el digital xd vi las pelis y todo pero no es lo mismo así que aquí estoy 🙉

Mi buen recuerdo se sigue manteniendo xd me gustó mucho el libro y ame lo fácil que es de leer. Siempre está pasando algo, me había olvidado de muchos detalles así que fue lindo volver a descubrirlos, además que disfruté viendo como actuaban ciertos personajes cuando ya se por qué lo hacen.

Spoiler! No lo vean si no han leído o visto todos los libros



Fin spoiler! xd

Sí hubieron unas cuantas cosas que para la trama funcionaban pero si me ponía a pensar no tenían mucha lógica, pero bueno en este caso no me importa xd y ahora estoy en la sería disyuntiva de si seguir con los demás en seguida o leer los otros libros que me había programado 😭 por qué soy así xd"
221,222,5,"I have forgotten how many times I read this series up until the age of 12. It was around that age where I read this series over and over again, and my copies were very well read they had begun to fall apart.

It wasn't until recently when I replaced the old, battered copies with new, more readable ones where I found myself wanting to read them again. And that is exactly what I am beginning to do.

It has been about 7 years since I have read Harry Potter, so taking this into account I thought I would remember very little to nothing. I must have read it that many times as a kid that I remember a lot more things that I thought I did.

One thing I did forget though was how much I enjoyed this series. I had forgotten how much I loved all the character and how much enjoyment I got while following Harry around.

I'm so glad to be going through this adventure with Harry once more, this time experiencing the story as an adult instead of a child."

2018 REREAD: I still love this book so much! Also, I finally read the illustrated version of the book and it’s absolutely beautiful!"
225,226,5,"Growing up in the era I did you couldn't get away from Harry Potter. In the bookstores, school yards, and big screens, it was Potter mania. It was so over saturated that I grew to hate Harry Potter even though I had never picked up a book or seen the film. My friends would blabber away about their love as I voiced my hated back to them just as passionately. One friend in particular would never let it go. ""You love books! How can you not even give it a go?"" ""NEVER!!!"" my stubborn self would protest. One day she came over to my house to hangout and after she'd left I found the first 4 Potter books sitting on my bed. She knew my inner book nerd would come out and that I'd have to open them. I was furious but figured if I read the first chapter or two I could tell her I gave it a go and finally get her off my back. Of course one chapter turned into 5, then 10, until suddenly it was morning and I'd read the whole thing. I spent the next 3 days reading the rest of them. By the time I saw her again I was a full blown Potterhead.

That was almost 20 years ago. I thought it might be fun to reread this one as an adult and see if my perceptions have changed. They haven't. It was still just as magical as it was that night I first entered Hogwarts. Rowling created such a wonderful world and filled it with characters who become your friends. It's been awhile but I'm so glad I visited them again and cannot wait to move on to the Chamber of Secrets!"
226,227,5,"This is the first time I have really read the first Harry Potter as a full fledged adult. I wasn’t sure how the first few books would hold up because I read them when I was so young and perspective and likes often change as we get older. I’m very happy to report that there are so many things I still love and now love differently as an adult. I use that term loosely btw. Adult. Anyway, I digress, but I don’t need to review Harry Potter. At this point, you most likely already read them and a bunch of reviews too. So this is mainly about this particular edition.

MinaLima is a publisher that creates the most beautiful hardcover books, with full color pages and pull outs, pop ups, and much more!!! It’s like a fully illustrated book on steroids and I must say it is absolutely, hands down, the most gorgeous book I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. The illustrations are just completely stunning!!! The 3d portions of the book make you feel so immersed in the wizarding world that I can’t help but adore each and every one.

While, I would just post a bunch of pictures of the book, I would prefer to recommend this to those who love Harry Potter. This is an even more amazing version of the book than the other illustrated version. I highly recommend you pick up a copy because it’s super fun to get so pulled in while reading. Enjoy!!!!"
227,228,5,"“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.""

I'm late to the Harry Potter party, but I guess it's better late than never.

Excellent. Beyond excellent. This book was full of adventure, mystery, and entertainment that pulls the reader into the story.

In this book, the experiences were as real as it could get. I felt so intrigued; I felt a connection with this novel. My personal connection to this book was with Harry's best friend, . I felt this connection because Ron is Harry's greatest friend and Ron help harry with everything, he would do anything for harry. He was an astounding friend to everyone. Ron wasn't the most courageous but throughout the book he found his bravery and showed it and became something of himself.

Every page is like a storm of detail and excitement. Every chapter is a new adventure and a new piece of the story, and right when you start you just want to find all the pieces.

This book is like being in a world where anything can happen, and you can make it happen. I vastly encourage you to read this novel, and once you do I promise you will unquestionably love it.

I can't wait to read the rest of the series,"
228,229,5,"My first ever reread!
Even after reading the book and watching the movie multiple times, it was still incredible. Now in English listening to the audiobook narrated by Stephen Fry and it was so fascinating!

I don't hardly like doing rereads, as I usually get bored, but this was my 17th reread and I still feel the magic every time I pick this book up. Again, might just be nostalgia talking. This series is far from perfect, but I love it regardless."
232,233,5,"5/5
epic"
233,234,5,"I wasn't sure if I was going to write a review of these books, but I try to write a review of all of the books that I read, and it's been kind of nagging at me that I didn't write one for this. It's hard to write a review for a book that is so dang popular and well known. What is there to say that's new? I dunno. I think pretty much everything's been said, but still I wanted to write a review for this, and to talk about these books, even if I'm just rehashing everything that's already been done.

I remember when these first came out, I never really wanted to read them. I thought of them as ""kid's books"" and even though I read YA, my overly-critical half just kept saying that these weren't for me. I don't know if it was the cover, or the insta-popularity of the books or what, but I didn't read them. I avoided them like the plague. Until a friend of mine was reading the 5th book, and was so engrossed in it that he would do the ""...yes, yes, I'm paying attention..."" nod while his eyes remained glued to the page. And as a reader myself, I know that look. So I asked to borrow the book he was reading, and he refused. He told me that if I was going to read it, I'd have to READ it, starting with the first book. So the next day, he lent me the first and second books, both of which I finished in record time, and then I understood. And I never looked back.

There's something about these books that is just... magical. Yeah, yeah, cliche, I know. But it's true. Yes, they are about magic, but they are about so much more than that. They are about love, and friendship and loyalty and trust and betrayal and commitment and all the things that we aspire to have and to be as humans. They are about understanding and forgiveness and learning who we are when it really matters. And all of these things are buried in this shell of fun and adventure and mystery that makes them irresistible.

I decided to read these again in the original UK editions, because I know that the US editions were ""Americanized"", and I wanted to re-experience them in their true form. I dislike when things are changed from their original format, I hate abridgments and condensed versions etc. I want to experience the story how the author wrote it, how it was meant to be experienced without some guy in a suit somewhere trying to make it ""accessible"" to me. I like the feeling that I get of learning something of another culture through the words they use, and the meaning that they give the words. This is why they taught us reading comprehension in third grade, so that we can read and LEARN. Learning doesn't have to be boring and tedious, it can be fun if we allow it to be. But it seems that we've lost that ability. Sad.

Anyway, I re-read the first book, now appropriately titled ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"", and I was surprised at how emotional I felt reading it, especially after knowing where it all ends. It was like seeing friends that you've missed for years again, and while it makes you happy to see them, it's also sad because you know they'll have to go again too soon. That's how I felt, like I was seeing friends and that my time with them is short. That's kind of a silly way to feel, because they are forever, and I can visit anytime I want to, but I felt that way anyway. Especially meeting Ron again. He's my favorite character for an absolute reason, which is because he is so loyal and funny and true, and he gives his whole heart when he gives it at all. I wish that there were more people like Ron.

I can't wait to re-read the rest of the series and see if this feeling remains. I love discovering the hidden gems that Rowling has left for us to find, in mythology and history and legend and word-play and in life. Who wouldn't love these books?"
234,235,5,"What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? 🧙
This was a re-read for me; if it was the third or forth time I don't know but I could re-read this series a thousand times and it would not be boring. It's the definition of fantasy for me and I will always feel some kind of nostalgia when reading it or even watching the movies. I love Harry for his courage, Ron for his sass and Hermione for her cleverness - they are just such a great trio and their friendship is probably one of my fav things about this series."

""It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.""

Though this was not the first time I read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, it was the first time I read the illustrated edition! While the illustrations are gorgeous and I'd recommend everyone to get this edition, I don't think it changed my reading experience. To be honest though, I already knew all the drawings due to my photos on , so it might be different for (because I haven't glanced through that one yet). Either way I have no idea how I am going to survive the sequel: there were tons of drawings of spiders in , is only going to get worse!

As much as I love the series, I have many issues with J.K. Rowling. That's no secret. In this book, there were also a couple of things that bothered me. First of, she is clearly fat-phobic. She needs to stop calling fat people pigs! Even though Dudley and Vernon are unlikeable, does not mean they should be made fun of due to their weight.
Some people might call her a feminist icon, but I very much disagree (She supports casting Johnny Depp even though he abused his wife!). Her misogyny becomes more clear in the later books, but there was also some in this one already. When Draco and Harry are flying on their brooms, ""there were screams and gasps from girls"". Some of you might not think that is sexist, but I hate the fact that she felt the need to add ""from girls"" to that sentence! As if the boys weren't scared or interested in what was happening...

As for the writing, I kind of dislike the way Hagrid's lines are written. If someone has an accent, I'd rather have that the author wrote ""x said in an accent"" or something like that.

Now, I will get into spoilers, foreshadowing, questions I have... So this part ! You've been warned!
• Ted the newsreader on the Muggle news grins when they are talking about the many owl sightings. I think that might be Ted Tonks! He was a muggle-born wizard, so it makes sense.
• Sirius let Hagrid borrow his bike!
• How can there only be one wizarding bank? That doesn't make any sense.
• Hagrid isn't allowed to do magic because he was expelled. Yet he knows how to do nonverbal spells?!
• There is rumoured to be a dragon in Gringotts ;)
• Why do the students have to buy their robes beforehand when they don't know their houses yet?
• James' wand was excellent for transfiguration.
• Molly asks what platform number they have to go to. It is always platform 9 3/4! She went to Hogwarts herself and takes her children there every year, so how could she not know that?
• Almost everyone of Harry's generation is sorted in the same house as their parents. Children do not always have the same traits as their parents, so that's unfortunate.
• Harry has the following dream:

I guess that this dream is foreshadowing for what's to come. Obviously, Quirrel's turban is Voldemort who talks to him at the end of the book. In , Harry questions whether he doesn't belong in Slytherin instead. Malfoy was supposed to kill Dumbledore in , but it was Snape who finished the job instead (hence the burst of green light).
• Snape urged Quirrell to stay loyal to Hogwarts. Therefore, Voldemort should know that Snape's true loyalties lie with Dumbledore, and not him.
• McGonagall says it's the first time four students were out of bed in one night. Okay, sure Minerva... We all know that's not true!
• She also says they shouldn't be walking around at night, ""especially these days"". What is she referring to?
• The centaurs are angry when Firenze interfered when Quirrell/Voldemort was going to attack Harry. Firenze says he hopes the planets have been read wrongly. So, the centaurs know Voldemort is going to kill Harry (they just didn't know when exactly).
• Peeves says ""wee student beasty"". I wonder whether he is referring to the Marauders?
• Dumbledore says that Voldemort is not truly alive, and therefore cannot be killed. Did he know about the horcruxes already?

: As usual, I enjoyed reading this tremendously. I love the amount of foreshadowing and look forward to re-reading the rest of the series again!"
243,244,5,"Edit (December 5, 2015):

First re-read I've ever done in my life. I must say, this book isn't quite the best thing in the world. It has many tropes I really hate (speshul snowflake, villain that only wants to take over the world for no reason, etc), but there's something magical about it and all those aspects for some reason make me smile.

It's amusing how innocent everything was when it all started. It could fool you into thinking this is just some kid's adventure when really is a journey that will eat our hearts. is not my favourite series ever, or the one that has affected me the most (that place is saved for by Rick Yancey), but certainly it's one of the best and it kind of made my childhood (I grew up with the movies, actually, not with the books, but I was, in any case, attached to the story since a kid). J.K., I'm sorry for saying you're not a goddess in my review.

______________________





There was a little girl named Vanessa who always wanted to do the contrary to what people wanted her to do. If she had a chore to do, she would do it as long as they let her alone. If mom or dad or one of her brothers or her sister or anyone in her family told her to do it, she would immediately refuse, because she takes no orders. She's her own boss.

As she was like that, then if something was popular, she would not do/read/watch/whatever it. Well, there was this particular series that everyone had read. It had movies and everyone loved them.

Do you know what she did? She promised herself she would read them. She had already watched the movies (the ones that were out) and she rather liked them, but she would touch the books, because doing so would mean she was just like everyone else, and she was special (yeah, I was that arrogant).



October 15th, 2011.

It was a gray day and it was her brother's birthday. Mother wanted to gift his son something that he would enjoy, but not videogames or stuff like that. She wanted something with more educational value - say, a book.

Mother knew Vanessa's brother liked the HP movies (up until the sixth one), and as there was a book fair at his school (which was mine too), and the books upon which the movies were based were there. She bought the first and gave it to his son for his birthday.

Some of her mother's friend had also given Vanessa's brother several of the other boks in the series. It seemed as if they had planned the whole thing.

Of course Vanessa thought there was a hidden purpose there. She thought her mother had bought the books so she wouldn't resist on picking them (I told you I was arrogant, didn't I?).

She was wrong. That was not her mother's purpose, but in the end, Vanessa couldn't resist the pull. She wanted and didn't want to read the books.

Wanted them for some reasons:

· She had always been intrigued by them.
· She was the reader in the house. She couldn't stand the fact that her brother (who hated - and still hates - reading) was going to read more books than her (don't even tell me).
· A ""friend"" of hers was bragging she had read the HP books in less than one week and she wanted to prove her she could do the same.

Didn't want them for some reasons:

· Reading them would mean she was a common girl (I was an insufferable 13-year-old girl - don't blame me).
· She would break her promise if she read them.
· If she read them, she would do what everyone else wanted her to do, and as you know, she hates being told what to do.

After a long time of deep philosophizing (aka one day), she decided she would read them. What could be the worst thing to happen?

It turns out she loved the first book. Her reaction upon starting it was something like this:



After that, she wanted the next ones. She borrowed the books from his brother and read them all up to the 5th one (those were the ones we had) in one week. She felt sorry for not doing it any sooner.

...

Yeah, I was and still am like that. I'm really glad I decided to read the books. They all have amazing plots, fantastic character development, writing that improves over the books, great story and world building, etc. What else can I need?"

His parents died when he was a baby and is forced to live with his abusive aunt and uncle and cousin, who force him to sleep in a closet under the stairs. He’s always believed there’s nothing special about him, until a mysterious stranger shows up and tells him the truth: he’s a wizard. He’s taken away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he finds a new home within the magic, dark secrets, and a life he could never imagine.

That was the worst summary I’ve ever written about a book, but obviously, I don’t need to tell everyone what is about. I only wrote it because I feel weird that my favorite series doesn’t have actual reviews, so I’m changing that during this reread. Ever since 2007, I've reread this entire series at least twice a year. It’s absolutely absurd, but it’s tradition. This is my 24th reread, which makes me sound incredibly ridiculous. That being said, no matter how I feel about now that I'm an adult, I will always, adore this series. Clearly, as I’ve stuck with my tradition and read it so much that I have a majority of it memorized, I still love it as much as I have my entire life (my dad read the first few books to me when I was a baby to calm me down, so... literally).



It’s crazy that this is just the introduction, because it’s such a beginning. I love getting to know all of the characters from the beginning, and it’s even more fun knowing who they turn out to be in the end. Each one of them is so developed and wonderful and absolutely adorable. As much as I love everything about the world and the plot, the characters are truly one of the best parts of it all. They really do make this series what it is and there’s no one better to be the main character than Harry. No one is allowed to talk shit on my oblivious child to me, because he is truly what makes this series the best it can be.

It’s rare a series lives on like this one has. It’s even more rare for me to love and adore a series for as long as I’ve loved and adored this one, and I’m so glad it’s not a short series, because every time I start to reread it, I never want it to end. It’s so engaging and captivating from the beginning until the very end. So, clearly, I loved . I’m glad I’ve continued my tradition, because it’s always exciting to be back in this world.

246,247,5,"I read this years ago...my kids were still young.

Did it bother anyone else that the publishers assumed Americans were too ignorant to know what the ""philosopher's stone"" was?
yeah, me to.

Well anyway, I've read and listened to this (these) and gone back to them several times since. Even though my children are grown I still enjoy this series of books. As originally written the series (considering the time between publication of each volume) actually grew with the first generation of kids who read them. They do get gradually darker as they go on, but (originally) the children who'd started were growing to. So, they actually matured with the story. (My only caveat is that parents should be sure their children are mature enough now to move to each volume. Now a ten year old could conceivably buy the set and read them one after the other, so, parents need to be proactive and be sure their ""youths"" are ready, mature enough for each book.)

I'm amazed at how much I still ""feel"" I know these characters and care about them even though they are fictional in a fantasy world. It's an accomplishment that's seen in the best of novels. Congratulations Ms.Rowling. While they have their flaws these are wonderful books. I had started to give them 4 stars, I give very few 5 star ratings. BUT upon consideration, I realized I'd read them several times and still enjoyed them greatly. These are wonderfully written novels. I rate it 5 stars.

This novel opens the story of Harry Potter, the boy who lived. We get to meet Harry, his aunt, uncle and cousin. We are introduced to the ""wizarding world"" and we go to Hogworts. And of course, we meet Ron and Hermione. I'd say if you're not charmed by this book and don't find yourself caring about Harry and his friends...maybe you should check for Grinch blood???

Enjoy."
247,248,5,"This year marks the 20th anniversary of the very first Harry Potter book so special editions have been released and of course I pre-ordered them months ago.

The story is the original one that we all know about. No amendments there, which is largely due to the fact that we experience stuff from Harry's POV so we only get to see certain common rooms at certain moments in the story.
Therefore, I'd like to conentrate on the extra content in each version as well as the GORGEOUS illustrations:
Every book has the respective house crest with the three characteristics in the beginning, followed by the individual chapters, in this case:
- Hufflepuff: An Introduction
- Making Hufflepuff Proud
- House Founder: Helga Hufflepuff
- House Relic
- House Livery
- House Ghost
Then comes the actual story, followed by:
- The Sorting
- Hogwarts Quiz
- House Common Room
- Memorable Hufflepuff Students
- Famous Hufflepuff Alumni
- Head of Hufflepuff House
- The House Cup
- J.K. Rowling, Twenty Years of Magic

Moreover, each book also has a pretty map of Hogwarts and its grounds:

Throughout the book, there are various illustrations unique to the respective house (of the house ghost, founder or head of house etc) by Levi Pinfold, which is really giving this an extra edge (just like the sprayed edges that are like the house livery).

The crests on the dust jackets are especially nice because of the contrast, which is why I decided t get the hardcovers and not the paperbacks.

It's a little bit of a cheat since I didn't re-read the entire book (especially not 4 times) but concentrated on the extra content and illustration, but although I knew the extra content from the early days of Pottermore, I still enjoyed this very much."
248,249,5,"It does not matter if it is the first time you’ve read it, the second, the tenth or even the hundredth ( I wish I could say I am exaggerating but I am not), Harry Potter would be a classic that I enjoy every single time. With time my eyes have become more open to the few flaws in the book but the fact that this book sits high atop the list of books I have read in my childhood would never change.

It is quite funny though, whilst reading the book I was transported to the mindset where I was wondering what the hell actually happened to my Hogwarts letter and also where I should not say He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’s name. In all curiosity though, why not say his name? It was not as if it was cursed or that it would bring him to your doorstep when you did. Hmmmm. It seems I have to read the rest of the series. How sad *heavy sarcasm*

It is truly astonishing in a manner how JK Rowling managed to come up with such a large and complicated universe. Truly, what the human mind conjures up has no extent. There is much criticism surrounding her in the present day but it does not in fact stop the truth that she has written one of the best books in the history of literature. We should not forget that this is a children’s book. Not a book of great morality or such.

With this I part, now dying to wait till I get back from work to start the second book and before any of it to catch up on the movie. Despite the major aspects of the book being cut off from the movie ( I am still peeved that we were cut of the pleasure of meeting Peeves, we lost the true hilarity of the Weasley twins and Ron) the movie was indeed a very good adaptation. Off I go because I need enjoyed this dip back in my childhood memories, a time that was much simpler and joyful."

2022 re-read by audiobook. Still helping the commute go faster.

—-January 2020—-

Annual reread of HP has begun. I like doing this on audio now that I have a longer commute. Will I ever get tired of reading this? (Probably not.)


---August 2018---
How is it that every time I pick up this book (and series) I find something new and fall in love all over again? I listened to the audiobook this time around (Jim Dale version) and it was such a treat. I will never tire of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and all of Hogwarts.




---April 2016---
Obviously, I am way behind the curve on this one, only now reading . When a book gets as much hype as this series it always puts me on edge and makes me worry it won't live up to it so I always hesitate to read it. Clearly that was not the case here."
250,251,5,"“It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.”
I've read this with a group buddy read and it was such a great experience, I've first read this back in 2013 and I haven't gotten around to reading the others in the series and now I feel like it's high time for me to read it. I adored every page, it was so nice to read it again, I missed Harry and Hermione and Ron and the twins and even Draco (I guess). I can't wait to see how they are in the next books. I solemnly swear that this time I'm going to read the entire series. Pinky promise.

252,253,5,"June 2016 - Rereading my all time favorite series is the BEST. EVER. Even up to this day, it never lose its charm. My reading journey started on this series and it will always remained in my heart. I feel so nostalgic. If you haven't read this series, it's never too late. :)

256,257,5,"""There are all kinds of courage,"" said Dumbledore, smiling.""It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.""



I love this book, with all my heart. That's why this review is so hard to write. Who has never heard about the guy who lived? I always say that the was the first book I have ever read, but then, there's this one. That I read sooo long ago, that I didn't remember a single thing about it. I know almost all lines by head because I've watched the movie thousands of times, but there's like reading the book. It's like myself talking to my brother after I finished it:

Gu, (his name is Gustavo - when we went to the USA, nobody understood his name. Is that an unusual name?) did you know that after Ron plays chess, there was another test? A potion one?
REALLY? Why wouldn't they show that at the movie? I bet it was amazing, potions and all. Hermione solve it, right? Imagine if I guessed it correctly like her?
Don't know, Gus. Would you read the book, then? There are thousands of things you will only know about HP if you read it
Nah, I hate reading.

like myself before I reread this, my brother and other people who never read this book and only watched the movie will never know the things that also happened. LIKE HOW MANY TIMES NEVILLE IS PRESENT ON THE SCENES! How Hermione is way geekier, Ginny is SO young, the way Hagrid speaks. And still, there are things that never seizes to amaze me about these books: They are present in every page of this, every scene, every line.

The way Hermione becomes their friend was always one of the things I liked the most. She's so different from Harry and Ron, and still, she fits. She learns, she takes risks, she goes with Ron and Harry in their adventures because she is brave, in her own way. She has a heart of gold, like my mom used to say, just like Harry.





I have to talk about Harry, as well. He is just... oh my. He is this eleven year old kid who lived with his mean aunt and uncle for his entire existence to discover that he is , actually, a So he goes to this school, finds out is famous and that his parents were killed for one of the best bad wizards out there. He doesn't know how to do magic, it's his first time making friends, in an entire new school in a total different environment, and still, he does good. Because he's kind, courageous, strong-minded, smart. He's an excellent friend, an excellent student. (unless when he's not sneaking around lol but still, he does it for the greater good). Harry Potter is not only one of these books you love, it speaks to you. It makes you care about people who are not real, and still, you love them. You have all the dvds, all the books. You watched every movie in the movie theater as soon as they were released. It was a tradition, something you waited the whole year for. Not in Leville's speech, because how has he grown!. Not in Snape's scene, not when Harry ""dies."" And you definitely didn't cry when the movie ended. It's just... it's a love for a series that will never die, you know?



I loved every aspect of this. I loved how the movie was as faithful as possible, loved the authors playing these characters so well, loved how different and important each one of them is. Snape, Dumbledore, Hermione, Ron, Neville Longbottom, George and Fred, Harry, of course. I just can't wait to read the next one and be mesmerized all over again."
257,258,5,"Я вперше читаю Поттера і для мене це просто вау, я вже не можу дочекатися коли почну читати другу частину)
Книга яка потрапила до мене саме в потрібний момент"
258,259,5,"In November 2001, weeks away from the release of the first film, and having heard so many positive things from fellow adult readers, I headed to the bookstore to buy Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. At the counter, the teenage salesgirl asked if this was my first time reading the series, to which I replied “yes"", and she guaranteed that I'd be back to buy book two upon finishing. I was somewhat skeptical – fantasy, wizards, and magic were not my usual read, and the cartoonish cover (sorry Bloomsbury) wasn't really selling it for me (pictured above) – so I went in expecting an entertaining children's story, but definitely nothing more than that.

I have never been so wrong about a book, and was blown away by how amazing it was, how adult it came across, and how quickly and easily I became immersed in , and unforgettable cast of characters. The first time around it took me a few chapters to get into, as there's a lot of information being thrown at you, and most of it was unfamiliar, especially given my lack of knowledge of fantasy fiction and concepts. But once Harry arrived at Kings Cross Station and met the Weasley's I was fully invested. Also, the fact that the majority of the plot was set at boarding school (and a magical one at that!) sucked me in even more. I adored the rules, routine, lessons, classmates, friends and bullies, teachers and staff, dormitories and houses and that the school setting was a castle with numerous staircases, endless rooms, corridors, hidden passages, and secrets nooks and crannies. I even loved all the magic – spells, charms, potions, wands, robes, ghosts, and that an evil, mysterious villain is a lurking constant feared presence that could return at any given moment. I also appreciate that the magic was dumbed down and fully explained and outlined for novices like me. I consider myself an expert now!

My re-read reminded me how I prefer book Ron to the movie one (wow, that's a mouthful). Nothing against portrayal of the character – I thought he did a fantastic job – but in the books Ron is a lot less comical sidekick. I actually find Harry has more awkward moments, although admittedly the books are in his POV so we spend the most time with him. Book Ron tends to be more confrontational and as a consequence gets into a lot of near miss, or fully-fledged physical altercations with characters like Draco Malfoy. Particularly in defense of Hermione, or criticism of his family, especially references to their lack of money.

For a children's story I was surprised how serious, dire, and terrifying some parts were.


I thought the movie did a fantastic job of sticking closely to the book with few scenes omitted.


And yes, I did hurry back to the bookstore to purchase the second I finished.

I'll leave you with a couple of quotes I laughed at, that I don't recall from previous readings."

260,261,5,"I have so much to say here, and there's no way I can say all of it. This series truly made me fall even deeper in love with reading.

We've all enthused about this first book a lot. I'd like to spare a few words for how this series improves down the line, even from its spectacular beginning.

J.K. Rowling really nails down her tonal shifts as the series continues. The darker tone of book five and its sequels takes this series to the next level in terms of plot AND character work.

Speaking of themes, this series manages to fit in so much meaning in one series. This book also deals with the fact that , even when they love you and want to help you.

I honestly think people forget how brilliant the plotting of these novels is. Remember the reveals at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban? The interesting twist on the chosen one trope in regards to Neville? It's clever and built up books in advance.

The side characters are so developed and interesting here. So many series barely bother with any characters other than the protagonist, yet this series doesn't miss that opportunity. The entire concept of the DA and their bonding as a team really stand out here.

And no, I have one major problem with the HP movies, and it has nothing to do with scenes being cut. No, I’m talking about scenes in the book being edited. Ron’s best lines are often given to Hermoine, examples including “you’ll have to go through us!!” Other lines of his are edited; a scene where he defends Hermione is replaced by one where he tears her down. The characters just don't come through well.

No review can really sum this series up, but it's worth a read for everyone. It truly deserves all the hype."

Since 1997, the Harry Potter series has enchanted readers, both young and old. Legendary British author, J.K. Rowling's debut novel has gained international acclaim since its initial publication, winning a total of seven awards. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the thrilling first installment of the series where all of the magic began.

The novel begins at the small, quiet house on Number Four Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey where the book's eleven year-old protagonist, Harry Potter, lives in the cupboard under the stairs. He was orphaned at a young age after his parents were killed in a tragic accident and was sent to live with the Dursleys: Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and their son, Dudley. His only living relatives treat him poorly, making Harry's childhood miserable.

Harry's unhappy demeanor is replaced by one of elation when he receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the finest school for witches and wizards in all of Britain. As the novel unfolds, Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts where he is introduced to the wizarding world, befriends other students, and comes face-to-face with adversity. The twists and turns, mounting suspense, and thrilling perils that Harry encounters render this book life-changning and unforgettable.

Rowling has a rare talent for creating believable, realistic characters that gradually change as the story progresses. These characters, as some people would say, possess a certain amount of depth. Their unique personalities and traits distinguish them from the characters in similar novels. Harry embodies all of the characteristics of a true hero: courage, tenacity, and an inclination to protect others. Harry is willing to sacrifice everything, including his own life, to ensure the safety of others. Rowling accurately captures his desire to protect those he loves, whatever the cost.

I must admit, Rowling's imagination is extraordinary. Her original vision of a young boy sporting a lighting scar who attended boarding school was transformed into a seven book series teeming with the unimaginable. Rowling's creative prowess enabled her to establish an entirely new world filled with realistic people, magical creatures, and thrilling enchantments. The wizarding world was crafted so thoroughly that it is flawless. No minor detail of this alternate world was excluded, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the book.

As the plot unfolded, readers received a glimpse of the growing complexity of the series. Rowling introduced specific details throughout the novel which the majority of readers overlook. These seemingly insignificant details, however, have a large impact upon later events within the book. My predictions of the events to come were quite far from the actual events that transpired. The shocking conclusion left me stunned and begging my mother to drive me to Barnes and Noble to purchase the second book.

While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone falls under the ""Fantasy"" genre, Rowling discretely incorporated many mythological and historical references into the novel, especially those pertaining to the works of Ancient Rome. First and foremost among these allusions is Hagrid's three-headed dog, Fluffy. The concept of such a creature is taken from Greek Mythology; according to legend, Cerberus, a three-headed dog, ferociously guarded the entrance to the Underworld. The only means of subduing Cerberus (and Fluffy, consequently) is the playing of a lyre. Additionally, the Hogwarts motto, ""Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus,"" is Latin for ""Never tickle a sleeping dragon."" Rowling relies heavily on her knowledge of Latin to create incantations and character names throughout the series.

I am most impressed not with the books themselves, but with the author whose rags-to-riches life story has inspired countless people worldwide. J.K. Rowling was born Joanne Kathleen Rowling into a poor family living in Gloucestershire, England. She was accepted at the University of Exeter, where she studied Classics. She was devastated when her mother died shortly after her graduation, having suffered from multiple sclerosis. Several years later, Rowling married Jorge Arantes and gave birth to their daughter, Jessica. The unhappy couple separated 13 months after their marriage. Homeless, penniless, and caring for a newborn, Rowling struggled with depression and contemplated suicide. We almost lost the brilliant, talented mind who is solely responsible for the series that has now become a worldwide phenomenon. Her rags to riches story inspires millions of people in similar situations. Despite her challenges, Rowling's perseverance and determination brought the world of Harry Potter to life.

Overall, this series is the most memorable from my childhood. I was originally introduced to the series in third grade and immediately fell in love with the realistic characters, suspenseful plot, and flawless writing style. I was the diehard fan who watched each movie a dozen times at the same movie theater, eventually coming to know the employees at the concessions stand on a first name basis. For Halloween last year, in fact, I dressed up in an old pair of robes, pulled on a wig, and drew a scar on my forehead. And to this day, I find myself reciting quotes from the series. I was crushed after the release of the final book, feeling that part of my childhood had ended with the series. Looking back, I have never once regretted the time I have spent reading and rereading the series, committing it to memory. The Harry Potter series has served as more than a way to pass the time; it has helped to shape the person I am today."

One of my goals for 2016 was to read the series from the beginning to end. I have read books one through four in the past, but never had a chance to finish the series, or watch the movies, and that was something I really wanted to fix this year. And once again, it took me too long to find time to actually do this, and I was worried that this goal would, once again, slip by without completing it. But, I was determined to get started on this series, and I FINALLY DID!!

Technically, this is my second time reading , with the first time being when I listened to it on audiobook way back before I first started blogging. I was super excited to start the series over again from the beginning, and I found that I enjoyed the book even more this time than I did the first time!

There are so many characters in this book that I love -- Harry, Ron & Hermione, of course, because they are all awesome and have the BEST friendship ever. But also Neville, Hagrid, Dumbledore, McGonagall, the Weasley family, and so many more. They are all so well written, and I'm really looking forward to seeing all these characters again as the series goes along.

The storyline for this book was magical and completely captivating. Once again, I was drawn into this story in different way than I did when I listened to the audiobook before. I guess because I was actually paying more attention this time around. I loved the setting and all the talk of magic throughout the story. It definitely kept me interested. This book was a really fun, and super quick read. I read this first book in just one days time, and I can't wait to get started on the next book ASAP!

The movie for this book is also the only movie I've seen so far. I rewatched it again with the kiddos after I finished my reread, and I really, really liked the movie. The characters are so great, and while there were some changes from the book, they really didn't bother me. I totally understand that they have to do some changes. I'm excited to watch the rest of the movies now, and plan to watch each of them as soon as I finish their book!

Overall; I really didn't think it would be possible to enjoy as much the second time as I did the first, but I totally did. I'm super excited to continue with the rest of the books, and the movies! And, hopefully, I will have them all finished before the movie is released in November, so I can actually a J.K. Rowling movie in the theater. *smile*

Happy Reading!!"
268,269,5,"Reread November 2014

Obviously this isn't my first time reading Sorcerer's Stone; I think this is the 3rd reading for me. And as every time before, I loved it immensely. I really am just reminded of how incredible J.K. Rowling is at crafting a story, a whole world, and setting up the rest of the series, while still writing a smart, entertaining children's book. Because in reality, this first book is very young feeling, but it's never dumbed down.

Since most people have read this or know the plot, I thought I would instead share some fun thoughts I had or noticed upon rereading this book:
-What do you think the sorting hat said to Hermione, Ron, or any of the other characters when they tried it on?
-Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog card mentions his defeat of Grindewald, a fact that doesn't come to be important until book 6 or 7!
-The Weasley twins are hilarious as always, and they know the secret passages already (probably thanks to the Marauder's Map) that shows up in book 3.
-I wonder why Hermione wasn't in Ravenclaw. (I'm sure there is some sort of answer for this one, I had just never thought of it before).
-I want Mrs. Weasley to knit me a sweater.
-The Mirror of Erised's inscription backwards says, ""I show not your face but your heart's desire.""
-In the book, when Harry first finds the Mirror of Erised, he sees a reflection of his mom, dad, and the rest of his family. But in the film it only shows Lily and James. That would've been cool to see in the film.
-Apparently, chess is the only thing that Hermione ever lost at (p.217). If she is so smart, don't you think she'd be really good at the strategy of chess?
-After seeing Quirrell/Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, Harry starts to have nightmares about the face dripping unicorn blood. I wonder if this is Voldemort already using Occlumancy on Harry?
-In the film, the protections that Harry, Ron, and Hermione have to get through to find the Sorcerer's Stone leave out the troll (placed by Quirrel) and the potions challenge (Snape's). Would've been fun to see Hermione tackle that one.
-Voldemort's face on the back of Quirrell's head is described as pale with red, slit eyes like a snake (like movie Voldemort). Why isn't that how they portrayed him in the first film?!
-Also, Neville's best exam grade was in Herbology. Aww.

Overall, I just thought it was remarkable to note how many things Rowling references already! It makes me even more excited to jump right into next!"
269,270,5,"I want to first discuss about the author, J.K. Rowling, before proceeding with the book. Overall, she is an author I highly respect due to the originality she employs in this book as well as the future books. On top of that, she uses classic narrative devices, which is not too common in magical fantasy books, and she delivers a complex, yet magical plot, which contributes to an entertaining thriller.

In general, this book is quite hard to put down. The magical plot, characters, concepts such as the four houses of Hogwarts, among other elements enhance the reading experience greatly. In fact, you can sense some inventive forms of wittiness in the writing and perhaps, Rowling herself.

Since this is a magical, fantasy book, humor plays a huge role. This is a story full of surprises and jokes that will allow you to better absorb the darker elements to the story. Those darker elements prove to be necessary since they are what makes the characters, and perhaps the story, more relatable. Ultimately, J.K. Rowling does a wonderful job with this book in the sense of inspiring and entertaining a wide audience ranging from children to adults, and it is all due to her inventive, imagination and originality."
270,271,5,"This series reminds me of restless nights lying in bed, curled up with a book. These books.

This is my third reread, and yet, everything still feels brand new. Though I would give anything to go through that first time again, the joy of going to the store every time I finished one of the books. The hours spent searching the web for quotes and backgrounds and pictures. All still sitting in my phone, awaiting my attention.

I haven’t written a full review in a while. I suppose I’ve never known what to say.

This review in particular is not about the book itself, rather the joyous memories that cloud my better judgement. The rush of sentimentality and nostalgia overtaking my senses. It hits all at once, the characters, the home I found myself in, the comfort.

I hope some can relate to this, at varying degrees of course. And if not this book, perhaps some other book that brings you happiness and bliss.

And with that, I leave to read the next book."
271,272,5,"No os pasa que siempre llega un momento en el año en el que decís: uf, qué ganas de releer Harry Potter. Entonces te sientes mal porque tienes un montón de libros por leer en casa y los de HP ya los has leído mil millones de veces, pero aún así lo haces igualmente.

Y bueno, poco tengo yo qué decir de esta maravilla de libro y de saga. Leer la edición ilustrada ha sido una gozada, las ilustraciones son preciosas y representan muy bien el espíritu del libro. He disfrutado de esta historia tanto como cada vez que la leo. La magia de Hogwarts, supongo.

Tampoco me quiero alargar porque no voy a decir nada de este libro que no se haya dicho ya.


Fin."
272,273,5,This illustrated edition is so beautiful!
273,274,5,It doesn't matter how many times I've read it before. Reading any Harry Potter book always cheers me up! :)
274,275,5,"✨talented, brilliant, incredible, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique✨

Harry Potter. The boy who lived. The most iconic character of all time. Everyone and their second cousin once removed on their step-mother’s side has read these books. I distinctly remember when I was introduced to these books by my mom when I was nine years old. I distinctly remember opening my mom’s tattered hardback copy for the first time, and discovering that Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. And so it began.

Not to be basic, but I must give credit where credit it due: the Harry Potter series were the books that made me love reading. I started the series when I was nine and finished it when I was twelve. My mom wouldn’t let me read the books all at once because she thought the last couple were too dark for as little kid, so for three years I yearned to finish the series, and when I finally did I was slightly crushed. Getting to read a new HP book was the highlight of my elementary years. Of course, I saw the movies after I finished each book, but I hate them with a burning passion so we won’t talk much about that. I reread this series Summer 2018, shortly after I turned fourteen. I loved the books even more than I remembered (and decided to forget the movies ever existed.)

If I’m being 100% honest, I had no future plans to reread Harry Potter anytime soon. But 2020 hit me hard and, after almost making it through the year, I crashed the week before Christmas. Once my twelfth breakdown of the week was finished, I restarted the series on a whim. I have to say it was one of the best decisions I've made all year.

I’ve always said that I like Harry Potter less than the average person. I don’t think that’s true anymore. is truly one of the most flawless works of literature of all time. Keeping in mind Rowling was an amateur, the writing is exquisite. The world building is unmatched. Rowling created the most magnificent fictional world and shared it with our mundane one, which is truly a blessing, especially in 2020. This books is an introduction to Rowling’s world of magic, so the plot isn’t as strong as the other books, but it really doesn’t need one. It’s funny and captivating, even if it does just chug along for most of the story.

I have wondered, as many probably have before me, what the best thing about Harry Potter is. The world, the writing, the plot. All very good. But a character driven person like myself has to say the characters. Reading HP all the way through for the third time feels like seeing some very old friends who I’ve drifted apart from. We rekindle our friendship in mere moments and pick up where we’ve left off.

, the one who started it all. Full disclosure, I didn’t like Harry as a character the first time I read the series. My favorite was Hermione (duh). The second time . . . I don’t know. But like, I love him now??? He’s seriously the cutest thing omg. The way the Dursleys treat him is downright abusive and it goes unchecked, unpunished, and it breaks my heart. Seriously, how did no one ever call child services on them? But does little small-bean-Potter let that break his spirit? No. No, he does not. The relief I felt when Hagrid came for him was incredible. On top of him being a lil cutie, he’s hilarious. How did I not remember his sass-streak??? Icon.

and are also precious little children. Ron is probably my favorite as-of this read-through. I’ve always felt a certain kinship to him that I haven’t with the others. The pressure he feels as a young boy to live up to society’s expectations of him because of his older siblings’ success is very real for me. He’s endearing, adorable, funny, all that good stuff I love to see in a character. Hermione, as always, is . There’s nothing I can say about her that hasn’t been said before, and there’s nothing I can say about my feelings toward her that would bring them to justice. I will say though, Ron and Hermione’s collective reputation is based on the movie’s portrayal, in which the crappy script gives Hermione everything and Ron . In the books (aka the only source material that matters), Ron has all the street-smarts and knowledge that comes from growing up in the wizarding world. Hermione is fiercely intelligent, but she’s not like she is in the movies, which is absolutely ridiculous and completely unrealistic. Ron is also a lot more gutsy than Hermione, and, while he does channel some dumbass energy, he’s not an idiot. Anyway, mini-rant over.

The Hogwarts classmates manage to all be interesting, fleshed-out characters, even though they do little. Namely, our Supporting Sweethearts, and . Neville is eventually one of the best-developed chapters of all time. In he’s sweet, but fairly irrelevant, except for spawning one of my favorite quotes of all time from Dumbledore, “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.” y’all have no idea how many times I’ve used that to win arguments Aaaaaand Draco. Possibly the most controversial HP character, which is really saying something. I go back and forth. As a Slytherin, I try very hard to not like him. More on this in later reviews, but in this book specifically, Draco is a bully. That’s it, that’s his character. But he’s like . . . really good at it tbh. There were so many times when I was like, “Draco, u totally suck . . . that was a rly good burn tho.’’

The Hogwarts staff body is 110% icons. , who I never really liked before, but now I do for some inexplicable reason. , the most mythic of all bitches. , The Actual Worst™️. , who I tried so hard to not feel sorry for, but failed miserably. Blame . And , Harry’s first friend, and whom I loved until I was like twelve and now I don’t really care about anymore.

do little in this book compared to the others, but I luvv zhem, so they get their own section. Mrs Weasley, Mom of the Year. Percy Weasley, who takes himself so gosh darn seriously that it’s almost cute. Almost. It’s sad to see him so young, back when his actions were merely the harmless ones of a boy and not the damning ones of a man. Fred and George, who are entertaining icon extremists, but also a bit mean. Teasing your older brother for being a twat is fine or whatever, but they’re rather cruel to Ron throughout the entire series, which bothers me. I don’t think they meant to, but in the later books you can see the lasting damage they did to their little brother’s self-esteem, and I can’t get behind it. And Ginny.

, who suck.

I cannot believe this series was created on a napkin on a train. 50 points to Jo.

tl;dr - this book and everyone in it are icons.

This was utterly amazing!! This is one of my new FAVORITE series ever!!! I am now going to be expecting a Hogwarts letter every year on my birthday, I want an owl 🦉 to deliver my mail, and I want to learn how to play quidditch and fly a broomstick, I want an invisibility cloak, I want to be a Witch.

The first time I read this, 2 years ago, I was not a bookworm I hated reading. I did not realize how amazing this book truly was, and I regret that. Now, 2 years later, I am rereading it, and I’m very glad Lily talked me into it! Speaking of that, I want to thank Lily so, so, so, sooo much for Buddy Reading this with me, without you I probably never would’ve picked this back up and I probably never would’ve gotten to read this amazing book. So thank you so so so so sooooo much!!!

Now to get into this review!

⭐️⭐️
⭐️


Harry: I liked Harry, he was relatable and a good friend. He was also pretty funny! Which I enjoyed!

Ron: Ron was my one of my favorite characters along with the rest of the Weasley family! Ron was funny, a good friend, and kind. Ron was the second person Harry met so they were Instant best friends!

Hermione: I absolutely love Hermione! In the beginning of the book she was described as: bossy, annoying, a show-off. I mean I kinda agree but mainly I love her!

Fred & George: I loved Fred and George!!! They were hilarious and are definitely some of my favorite characters!!!

Hagrid: I love Hagrid! Hagrid was amazing! Was very nice, and was the only one to send Harry mail.

Professors: my favorite professor has to be, Professor McGonnaglle (sorry if I spelled her name wrong), my least Favorite professor is Quirelle (again sorry if I spelled his name wrong) I was skeptical of him from the beginning. I didn’t like Snape in the beginning, and I still don’t love him, but once we learned he was trying to save Harry, I liked him more.

Dumbledore: Dumbledore is a genius, we’ll leave it at that. And I love him, he’s an amazing character!

The Dursley’s: the Dursleyes suck. Period.

Malfoy: Draco Malfoy. . .I can’t decide if I like him or not.

Neville: Neville. . . Was kinda annoying. . .

the Plot was amazing!! It made sense, and I now understand why everyone (the majority of people) loves this book.

the writing was utterly amazing. It kept me interested from the very beginning!

Overall I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this book!!! I will recommend it to everybody (although I feel like a good bit of ppl have read it lol) I will definitely reread this, and I’m very excited to read the rest of the series!! Goodbye all you Muggles, I’m heading to platform 9 3/4 to get on the Hogwarts Express with all the other wizards! 🦉🧙‍♂️🧹"
276,277,5,"I first read this series back in the 90s with my oldest son. We went to see each movie as it came out. Love this series! In 2018, I made a promise to myself to read more books for enjoyment and to revisit books I love. So I'm going to revisit this series on audio! There is just something so awesome (even as an adult) to have someone read a story to you, especially when it's such a rich, creative, fantastical series as Harry Potter.

I loved every minute of this audio book. Narrated by Jim Dale, the audio is just over 8.5 hours long. Dale does an excellent job of voice acting. He really gets into the spirit of the story. It really made it a fun experience! I did learn something new....even more embarrassing than when we went to the first movie way back in the 90s and discovered we had been horribly mispronouncing Hermione's name....I have been saying Voldemort wrong for 20 years. The American movies pronounced it VoldemorT. But it actually sounds like VoldemorE....no T sound at the end. That actually makes complete sense. Derp derpity derp on my part. But....in my defense....the American movies mangled it. I'm sure as I work my way through these stories again that I will find other things I have wrong....sigh. But, despite another round of embarrassment at screwing up Rowling's character names for YEARS, I loved listening to this audio book! I have the second book on hold at the library already! I can't wait to re-visit the Chamber of Secrets! (and hopefully I don't discover any more derpy errors on my part)

This is an audio book I could listen to over and over.....so I'm going to buy the set. Then I can revisit Harry, Hogwarts and the Gang any time I want to! :)"
277,278,5,"“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
Teach us something please,
Whether we be old and bald,
Or young with scabby knees,
Our heads could do with filling
With some interesting stuff,
For now they're bare and full of air,
Dead flies and bits of fluff,
So teach us something worth knowing,
Bring us back what we've forgot,
Just do your best, we'll do the rest,
And learn until our brains all rot...”


No review can do justice to the magic that is Harry Potter. Thus, I say only, take a bow Joanne Kathleen Rowling, for you have given the world something remarkable."

after a couple of months the first movie was out and the school brought us to movie theater to watch it and I actually fell in love with the movie! So I've watched almost all the movies and then at a certain point I stopped and I promised myself that I wouldn't watch the last three movies, not until I would have read the series...



Well after 14 years I've finally had and I'm so ashamed that I've waited so long... This book is adorable, perfect, I loved it!!! And I've already started the second one!!! Have to make up for all the years I've lost! D: But I've chosen to read it in my language, italian ;)... It's funny how a bad memory can influence you.

Dopo quattordici anni sono finalmente riuscita a trovare il ""coraggio"" per iniziare questa saga. Eh si, coraggio. Dopo il trauma subito da piccola avevo paura di riprendere questo testo. Ogni volta che pensavo alla saga di Harry Potter mi rivedevo piccola, seduta accanto alla mia professoressa d'inglese che mi invitava a leggere e cerchiare tutte le parole che non comprendevo (che erano tantissime, considerando che ero appena uscita da ESL - classe per alunni stranieri nelle scuole americane - da pochissimo). E quindi successivamente non ho mai più voluto saperne di HARRY POTTER! Dannazione!!!! ... quanto mi pento di non aver trovato il coraggio prima... per fortuna Harry Potter è in grado di stupire non solo i bambini!!!



Dopo un paio di mesi dalla lettura del testo la scuola ci portò a vedere il nuovo film di Harry Potter al cinema, ma che dire... il film mi rapì completamente. Non vi era nessuno che mi osservava, solo io ed Harry. Ed iniziai a vedere anche i film successivi. Ma poi dopo il quarto mi imposi di fermarmi. ... beh dopo tanti anni eccomi qui!!!





Questo libro è dolcissimo!!! Harry, Ron, Hermione... ohhh can't wait to see how the love between the two grows!!! <3 <3 <3



che non stanca mai, che ti tiene incollata alle pagine! Un testo davvero unico, con protagonisti straordinari... e sto solo all'inizio! Non vedo l'ora di continuare... beh in realtà già sto leggendo il secondo!

289,290,5,"ALL THE STARS for the book that got me into reading ★★★
This book is for you.I've learned more about life and what kind of person I would be from reading this book and listening to the amazing Harry Potter and the Sacred Text Podcast than I did from most of the people I know, much less the education I was privileged enough to receive.

⤐ Preface.
I was six years old when my mum dragged me to the movies while I was going on and on about how I would surely be hating this dumb film about a boy with glasses and his stupid friends.

Naturally, by the end of the film mum had a hard time getting me out of my seat, I so wanted to rewatch the entire thing immediately.

My mum being my mum saw that coming and gifted me the German audiobook, read by the amazing Rufus Beck, just weeks later. And so it began. This Journey embarked and reembarked on ever since I was 8 years out.


I've lived more than twice as much with Harry Potter in my life than without it, and I wouldn't want it any other way. And if there is one thing that could have possibly made these journeys better then it's the podcast. Understanding a text such as this is a matter of the heart, some might say, but what Vanessa, Casper, and most recently Matt, and the entire rest of the team do should be considered charitable work as much as an incredible academic achievement. I just ... I'm sorry this is a review about the podcast more than about the book.

Lot's of folks make jokes about grown-ups who cherish HP the way I and so many others do but I'm not giving a flying fig about it.

I went to Hogwarts. I'm a Gryffindor primary and a Slytherin secondary, and I model Hufflepuff. I'd not be a member of the Order probably but I'd sure as fuck protect my folks at all cost.



: This book is actually about a boy called Neville Longbottom who is good to his core, an amazing person and just an overall fluffball. Protect at all cost.

Todavía recuerdo cuando mis padres me regalaron ‘Harry Potter y el prisionero de Azkaban’ y aluciné en colores con el mundo que me encontré entre sus páginas. Tendría 11 o 12 años y creo que fue perfecto cruzarme con esta historia por aquel entonces. Inmediatamente me enteré de que lo que acababa de leer era la tercera entrega de una serie y fui corriendo a hacerme con los dos anteriores, que leí en cuestión de días. Entiendo perfectamente que supusiera el acercamiento a la literatura para miles de niños que no habían mostrado antes ningún interés por los libros.

296,297,5,"Son okuyuşumun üzerinden beş yıldan uzun zaman geçmiş olduğunu fark edince, seriyi -herhalde 80. kez- baştan okumaya karar verdim. Okumaların arasına birkaç yıl, serinin kitaplarının arasına da farklı birkaç kitap aldığınız takdirde Harry Potter'ları ölene dek tekrar tekrar okuyabilir ve aynı keyfi alabilirsiniz gibi bir teorim var :) Bu vesileyle daha önce bloğumdan paylaştığım Harry Potter yazılarını da ufak düzeltmelerle ekliyorum buraya:

Yedi kitaplık serinin birincisi olan Felsefe Taşı, büyücülük dünyasına bir giriş niteliğinde, çok eğlenceli bir giriş hem de. Bildiğimiz dünya, sihirle dolu bir dünya daha saklamaktadır. Büyüyle ilgisi olmayan, bizim gibi sıradan insanlar (yani 'Muggle'lar) olur da bir şekilde haberdar olursa sihrin varlığından, derhal Sihir Bakanlığı'ndaki yetkin kişilerin büyüleriyle bildikleri unutturulur, böylece sihirden uzak insanlarla büyücüler, birbirlerine karışmadan, yanyana yaşar gider. Anne ve babasını da öldüren karanlık büyücünün öldürücü lanetinden kimsenin anlamadığı bir şekilde kurtulan 1 yaşındaki Harry Potter, ona bakması için teyzesinin evine bırakılır. Bu arada kendisine saldıran kötü büyücünün yaptığı büyü geri tepmiş, güçlerinin çoğu yitip gitmiştir, artık Voldemort ölü mü, sağ mı belli değildir, ondan adını söyleyemeyecek kadar çok korkan büyücü dünyası (ondan bahsederken Kim-Olduğunu-Bilirsin-Sen derler) rahatlamış, eski refahlarına, barış içindeki düzenlerine kavuşmuştur.

On yıl geçer; Harry'nin teyzesi, eniştesi ve kuzeniyle birlikte geçirdiği on korkunç yıl. Dursley'ler Harry'e öyle kötü davranırlar ki... Harry merdiven altındaki dolapta yaşar, kuzeni Dudley'nin artıklarını yer ve giyer, evde akrabalarından herhangi bir sevgi görmediği gibi sürekli azar yer, okulda da hiç arkadaşı yoktur, çünkü kimse kabadayı Dudley ile papaz olmayı göze alamaz. Bunlara rağmen Harry (filmlerdekinden biraz farklı olarak) ezik büzük, sünepe bir tip olarak büyümez - gayet muzip, güçlü karakterli ve zeki bir çocuktur, etrafındakileri de bolca ""idare eder"". Son derece sıkıcı Muggle'lar olan teyzesi ve eniştesi büyü dünyasından nefret ettikleri -ve deli gibi korktukları- için, Harry'ye kökenlerini, anne babasının birer büyücü olduğunu ve nasıl katledildiklerini anlatmamışlardır bile -Harry büyünün b'sinden habersizdir, ailesi de o bebekken bir araba kazasında öldü sanarak büyümüştür. Bu nedenlerle bir gün kapıda saçı sakalına karışmış bir dev belirdiğinde ve Harry'e bir büyücü olduğunu, üstelik bir bebekken farkına varmadan da olsa Voldemort'un güçlerini yok ettiği için büyücüler dünyasında çok ünlü bir büyücü olduğunu, bundan sonra Hogwarts Cadılık ve Büyücülük Okulu'na gideceğini söylediğinde, Harry'ciğin şaşkınlığını tahmin edersiniz. Felsefe Taşı da, Harry'nin arkadaşlarla ve düşmanlarla, üç başlı köpekler ve trollerle, uçan süpürgeler ve ejderhalarla dolu geçen okuldaki ilk yılını anlatır.

Kitap dostluk, cesaret ve sadakat kavramlarını işliyor ancak öyle kör göze parmak şeklinde süslü methiyeler, bariz dersler yok, küçük hadiseler üzerinden incelikli biçimde işleniyor her türlü öğe. Serinin bu ilk kitabı özellikle çocuk kitabı olarak tanımlanabilecek olmasına rağmen metnin mesaj kaygılı gibi görünmemesi, yazarın da okuyucusunu küçük görmemesi, verdiği mesajları çok şık biçimde zekice vermesi çok hoşuma gitmişti ilk okuduğumda.

Rowling'in basit, dolaysız bir anlatım dili var: gösterişe, dramatize etmeye yer olmuyor metinlerinde. Üstelik tarzını genel olarak nüktedan buluyorum; bazı bölümler son derece ince, çok da komik esprilerle dolu. Felsefe Taşı'nın dili çocuksu sayılabilir, en azından serinin üçüncü kitabı ve ardından gelenler kadar ""yaşsız"" olmadığı kesin, ancak bu kitabın büyüsünü azaltmıyor. Ayrıca üslubu inanılmaz akıcı, kurgusu da okuyucuyu esir alıcı olduğu için, çocukça olsa da olmasa da kendinizi kaptırıyor ve bir oturuşta yiyip yutuyorsunuz.

Harry Potter kitapları büyü dünyasında geçmesine rağmen, altmetinlerde bolca gerçek hayattan kesitlere rastlamak mümkün. Bu seri her şeyden önce ırkçılık ve ayrımcılık üzerine zaten. Rowling Felsefe Taşı'nın hemen her bölümüne, sonraki kitaplarda olacaklar için ipuçları serpiştirmiş. Hiçbir devamlılık hatası yok, yazar detaylara olağanüstü önem vermiş. Bu kitabı bitirince bir HP bağımlısına dönüşmeyeceksiniz büyük ihtimalle, ama daha fazlasını merak edeceksiniz. İkinci kitap da aynı şekilde sürükleyici olduğu için, o da bir solukta bitecek ve üçüncü kitabın ortalarında bir yerde, çoktan bir bağımlı olmuş olacaksınız. Artık daha fazla zaman yitirmeyin, kendinizi Harry Potter'ın olağanüstü dünyasından yoksun bırakmayın :)"
297,298,5,"I'm not the usual Harry Potter fan, I don't think.

To the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure."" - Albus Dumbledore I don't wanna die! Who cares? My favorite Dumbledore is Aberforth. Y'know, the one who performed an experimental charm on goats and got sent to appear before the ministry for it. Albus isn't even sure he can read, for that matter. I'm more Aberforth on the wisdom scale, fo' sho'. (I once asked JK Rowling what the charm was. She said my guess was as good as hers. She also laughed evilly. I have my answer.) Wake up and smell the flowers? Huh? The goats are eating all the flowers and they sure smell experimental pretty. It wasn't as fun after Order of the Phoenix and the bitching commenced. Yeah, there were problems. But I'm not organized, I don't wanna die, and I never really cared how it ended as much as I cared about focusing on the cool little stuff.

I got into the series after Prisoner of Azkaban came out and before Goblet of Fire. (So it wasn't the movies or that Daniel Radcliffe was -then- Elijah Wood before he was uglier.) What made me want to read them? The Dursleys. I thought they sounded wonderfully delicious (they are hilarious. I love it when Vernon tells everyone that Harry attends ""St. Brutus' Center for Incurably Criminal Boys"". His Japanese golfer joke. When playing trivia games with friends I'd piss myself with excitement if I got a muggle question. ""Vernon's drill company is called Grunnings! Yes! I'm more amazing than all of you put together!"" Wonder why no one plays reindeer games with me anymore...) I love muggles.

I loved the stupid shit. No, not the mythology references. Yaaay she read Shakespeare. My Uncle Remus did too. Not even that she listened to The Smiths and The Beatles while coming up with the series (I do love that). I loved the Aberforth goat stuff. I loved the names of Lockhart's books (Gadding with Ghouls, Year with the Yeti, etc.) and the little humor stuff she slips in. I can still quote asshole-y things that Draco Malfoy taunted them with (Potter stinks!) and can't remember the basic plot twists.

I was a card carrying Potterite (laminated!). Sigh. I do miss wondering what was going to happen next. I miss having that place to retreat to in my mind. I'd go on my favorite Harry forum and have fun making up theories (I was right about EVERYYTHING *coughs*). I'm jealous of JK Rowling for having that place in her mind. Yeah, I've got my own stories. But I don't think I have as much fun with mine (probably because I'm not a sadistic murderer like she is).

I liked the books better before they grew up. Rowling couldn't write a love story for anything. I hated it whenever Ron was mad at Harry. My favorite Buffy seasons to watch when depressed are the first three because the core group are still together. I love the togetherness. (Aberforth was eventually important in the last book. That almost ruined it.)

P.s. In case I didn't look dorky enough... I used to get into rabid debates about the English to American changes with the transatlantic fans. They were all like: ""Americans are so dumb that you don't understand what Philosopher means."" I delivered eighteen shots to their stomach with my comebacks about Lee not being black in their versions, JK Rowlings name being JK in the first place (it doesn't mean Just Kidding. The publishers thought boys wouldn't read a female author), and their effing ugly covers (English kids lose so often. No Edward Gorey for Joan Aiken's books!). I did know that jumper meant sweater. It's not just a Hayden Christensen vehicle."
298,299,5,"My history with Harry Potter is a long and complex one. Originally, I refused to be part of the hype and read this book. No idea how long it took the series to cross the channel and come to Germany, but I never wanted anything to do with it. However, one Christmas there was nothing good on TV and the program showed the picture of a snowy owl (my favourite animal) so, reluctantly but also finally slightly curious, I switched on the TV and was ENCHANTED by Diagon Alley, the atmosphere throughout and the insightful and funny story as well as the performance by all actors (my favourite was McGonagall from the start).

Not long after, I was asked to come see the 4th movie in theatre and I loved the Triwizard Tournament. I watched the 5th movie in cinema as well, but still did not own the books. About a year later, I even held a presentation in English Literature together with three others (each of us was representing one house, complete with the respective scarf, Dobby and some Hogwarts banner for decoration and Harry's wand instead of a laser pointer for the power-point presentation on the screen). It was only after that that I looked for the books online. I never bought them because I never liked the normal editions, but then I found this special edition of the hardcover which I bought immediately as well as the special hardcover edition of the second one (the others followed shortly later). Only then did I finally read the story for myself!

What struck me immediately upon reading this for the very first time was that Rowling always matched the age of Harry with the writing style: we see everything through Harry's eyes, easing into an entirely new world, being just as amazed as he is, and the writing style represents that from one book to the next (there is a development in complexity that matches the development of the kids growing up).
At the same time however, the story moves the reader so much because it doesn't shy away from addressing dark topics like child abuse and bullying.
The dialogues are witty and comical, and core topics such as friendships and loyalty are present everywhere. In principle those are standard ingredients for stories and yet Rowling manages to mix them together in such a unique way that is simply (excuse the pun) .
The way she makes the characters, creatures and places come to life and transports the reader into the wizarding world, is a master-stroke. There are so many intricate details that make everything seem so utterly real and that show she had the entire world planned out from the beginning, just waiting to tell the entire tale.

I always love coming back to this fantastic world, taking classes at Hogwarts, eating in the great hall, solving mysteries even if it's life-threatening. Yes, I'm a complete Potterhead and proud of it! :D

For anyone wondering: I'm a Gryffindor; my wand is spruce with phoenix feather core, 10 3/4 inches long, unyielding; my Patronus is a fox (and in Ilvermorny I would have been in Horned Serpent). So there you go."
299,300,5,"There's a decent chance you won't like this book.

Let's be honest here. If you're reading my reviews and haven't read this series, you're probably an adult, which means two things. One is that you have lived through this series releasing 7 novels, 8 movies, and becoming a cultural phenomenon. If you're here, you felt that societal pressure to read this, or one of your friends won't shut up until you do (probably). There is little chance the hype can withstand reality.

And that is partly because... you aren't eleven years old. This book is written for children. Yes, the books get darker and more mature (and much better) later on, but this one is for middle school aged kids.

This is my first time rereading book 1 in at least 6 years. This book commits sins I would never forgive if they occurred in a different book. The main characters are dumb, the authority figures should all be fired for child endangerment, and in order for some events to make any sense, one has to create their own head-canon. Typically at such points, I stop, remind myself that this is a children's book, and get a glass of Maker's 46.

But forgive them I do. Rowling creates a fantastic world, characters, and story over these seven books that makes it all worth it. If I were reading this for the first time today, I honestly do not know if I would DNF this due to the above sins or simply for it targeting a much different audience than adult me. But I do know that having read the rest of the series, it didn't even cross my mind not to finish this reread, despite seeing all of the problems. The writing is designed so the target audience ages with Harry, so while we never get adult novels, we do get much ""better"" writing in later books. If you read this book or even the first two and the writing is much of what turned you off, I encourage you to keep going for another couple of books.



As a final note, my rating for this book is for the series. I can't honestly rate this book by itself at this point."
300,301,5,"This was a reread of the illustrated edition and even after countless rereads, this story will always remain magical and hold a special place in my heart.

If I had to credit one series that started my love of reading, it would be the Harry Potter series. I know I definitely read books prior to reading them but when I look back in my memory it’s the first book that I truly loved.

There isn’t much to say about the story that people don’t know, so I will just say that it’s a timeless classic. No matter what age, I will be able to come back and reread any book of the Harry Potter series and feel like I’m home.

I really like the addition of this illustrated series because it adds a visual element to the story. I personally never had a problem imagining all of the wonders of this magical world and story but I know some people need illustrations to encourage their imaginations. Additionally, Jim Kale’s artwork is beautiful and absolutely stunning. Even for those that will prefer to solely read the original novel form, this item is a Harry Potter collector’s item. Now that I have it, I can’t imagine not having it as a part of my series collection.

Overall, there isn’t a lot that can be said that hasn’t been said before when it comes to this series. If you haven’t read it, give it a chance...no matter your age. You might be surprised how much you enjoy it."
301,302,5,"First read: this first edition hardcover is from october 2000, so I guess around that time..?

Second read: buddyreread in June/July 2016, with good AND bookish friend Rowie, how perfect is that :D.

It was a great experience to reread this book for the first time. I loved meeting all the characters again while I already knew them, and I love going back to places I already love. I'm really happy I still like my favorite character, Hagrid, as much, and I'm really happy the book was this good second time around as well.

I had some issues with Harry and how some events went down, but I still loved reading this a lot and it's Harry Potter so still 5*!"
302,303,5,"First read 1997-ish 5/5 ★
Second read via audio october 2019 5/5 ★ (jim dale is a master narrator!)

I was 9 years, 1 month and 19 days old when Harry Potter first published, which quickly ignited a 9 year old's passion for reading that has spanned a little over two decades now. With money my parents gave me for one book at my 4th grade scholastic book fair, I chose Harry Potter. I grew up with each book and I always knew to expect the next release on either my birthday or Christmas. I finished the series as a 19 year old sophomore in college when Deathly Hollows released.

Thank you, J.K. Rowling"
303,304,5,"Тази година и аз реших да се включа в честването на рождения ден на Хари Потър (31-ви юли) като препрочета първата книга.

(Все пак това беше любимата ми поредица от детските ми и тийнейджърски години, и тогава излизането на всяка нова книга /и филм/ за Хари Потър за мен си беше особено събитие и празник.)

Като цяло първата книга е с преобладаващо по-детски и лек сюжет, в следващите историята започва да еволюира по-малко и става по-сериозна и обоснована.

Ако днес я четях за първи път, вероятно нямаше да ѝ дам толкова висока оценка, но пък книгата ми носи много приятни спомени и преживявания, така че просто няма как да я променя към по-ниска.

😍😍😍"
304,305,5,"So this is the first time I read Harry Potter (yeah I know WHY???) and now I can officially say it is AMAZING!

I'd love to describe how this book made me feel but I just can't find a word to do it so let's say...you know that feeling when you didn't know a part of your heart was missing until you feel like something starts to fill it? Well, it was kind of like that (*starts crying*).

Anyway, I recommend it to everyone who hasn't read it yet. I can asure you it's never too late to start reading Harry Potter."
305,306,5,""" Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him!

312,313,5,"To seria mojego dzieciństwa, kocham ją całym sercem i nieważne który raz z kolei ją czytam, zawsze świetnie się przy tym bawię, zdecydowanie 5 za wszystko"
313,314,5,"Als im Oktober 2015 der erste Harry Potter Roman Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen von Joanne K. Rowling als illustrierte Schmuckausgabe in den Handel gekommen ist, war es für mich eine mehr als einfache Entscheidung, mir dieses Buch anzuschaffen. Ich bin mit den Geschichten um den kleinen Zaubererjungen Harry Potter großgeworden und ich liebe nach wie vor die Bücher und Filme sehr. Man kann für Harry Potter, Hogwarts und Co. einfach niemals zu alt sein! So hatte ich das Buch also bereits kurz nach dem offiziellen Erscheinen tatsächlich in den Händen und war von Anfang an total überwältigt. Bereits das wundervoll illustrierte neue Cover von Jim Kay lässt erahnen, mit wie viel Liebe Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen neu aufgelegt worden ist. Bevor man auch nur ein Wort gelesen hat, ist man über beide Ohren in dieses Buch verliebt (wenn man es nicht ohnehin schon war). Die ersten Seiten beeinhalten eine Skizze von Hogwarts und zahlreiche wundervoll gezeichnete kleine Bildchen. So ist bspw. das Inhaltsverzeichnis mit den fliegenden Schlüsseln, welche im weiteren Verlauf der Handlung eine kleine Rolle spielen werden, dekoriert und man ist fasziniert vom hohen Maß an Details, mit denen uns Jim Kay hier verwöhnt.

Nun kann ich nach dem ersten Schwärmen auch endlich zur eigentlichen Geschichte kommen. Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen handelt, so wie alle weiteren Romane, vom Zauberer Harry Potter, welcher zusammen mit seinen besten Freunden Hermine Granger und Ronald Weasley die magische Schule für Hexerei und Zauberei Hogwarts besucht. Doch weiß Harry zunächst gar nicht, dass er ein Zauberer ist. Aufgewachsen ist er nämlich bei seinen nächsten Verwandten, den Dursleys, weit ab von allem, was acuh nur ansatzweise magisch zu sein scheint. Harry Potter verlor in seiner frühsten Kindheit seine Eltern bei einem Autounfall und musste aus diesem Grund bei den Dursleys aufwachsen. Diese konnten aber nie so richtig etwas mit Harry anfangen und behandelten ihn dementsprechend auch. Er wohnte in einem Schrank unter der Treppe, musste sich mit abgetragenen und alten Klamotten seines Neffen Dudley zufrieden geben und führte ansonsten insgesamt auch ein sehr unscheinbares Leben. Doch das alles änderte sich schlagartig zu seinem 11 Geburtstag an welchem sich herausstellte, dass es tatsächlich so etwas wie Zauberei gibt und er an der Zaubererschule Hogwarts aufgenommen worden ist und er in der Zaubererwelt eine echte Berühmtheit ist. In Hogwarts erlebt er letztendlich ein sehr spannendes Jahr, gewinnt neue Freunde und muss sich einer dunklen Bedrohung stellen, die ausgestorben geglaubt war. Eine packende Geschichte nimmt ihren Anfang.

In dieser illustrierten Schmuckausgabe von Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen gelingt dabei eine einzigartig gelungene Kombination. Joanne K. Rowling kann auf ganzer Linie mit einem sehr mitreißenden Erzählstil von Anfang an an die Seiten fesseln und entführt uns durch ihren sehr bildlichen Erzählstil in die magische Welt von Harry Potter, aus welcher man gar nicht mehr zurück in die Realität kehren möchte. Die tollen Beschreibungen und Handlungsstränge werden dabei insgesamt durchgehend wundervoll illustriert von Jim Kay dargestellt, wo ein absolut stimmiges Gesamtpacket entsteht. Eine einzigartige Geschichte, die bis heute ihres Gleichen sucht gepaart mit dem absolut genialen künstlerischen Talent von Jim Kay. Ich habe selten so ein fantastisches Buch in Händen halten können und in Zukunft werde ich mit Sicherheit wieder einen Blick hinein werfen und die Geschichte von Harry Potter immer und immer wieder lesen. Großartig!

Fazit:
Magisch, mitreißend, wundervoll erzählt und toll illustriert. Hier stimmt von Anfang an alles"

“There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.”



I really enjoyed this “going slow” approach. Reading only a chapter a day made me focus on smaller details. It made me really appreciate how much time put into these books. The little things foreshadowing what the rest of the series will hold.

created my best friends in these books. I didn’t catch the first book when it came out, so I had the luxury of reading the first two books in the same year. And only then had to start the
I was in love from chapter 3; where Hagrid tells Harry he is a wizard.


This new magical world and all the greater characters climbed into my heart and I could not but love every minute I spend with them. The camaraderie of the trio, their adventure and all the trouble they got into.
As an adult, I’m still in love with everything in these books, but now there is more.
I see different things, hear words differently and I fall in love with it even more.
This sad, valiant tale of an orphan that just wants love and acceptance breaks my heart. And I just want to hold him, and care for him and make him understand that he is worthy. Even knowing how it all ends, this over-protective feeling prevails.
The magic is still there, but now it’s tainted with a deep sadness of what could have been.

This will most probably be my most cherished series.

I’m more than happy to dedicate this year to reading a chapter a day to get the most out of this serreis. #PotterADay #ReadAlong #Litsy

Last year I read by
Between the pages that explaining flower meanings I found this note:





I think this is a new record!

This was almost just as much fun to read as the first time, only difference is I didn't need to do it in secret late at night so my parents wouldn't catch me reading a banned book.
Okay, it wasn't that much fun this time, but the book transferred me straight to a magical place, just like the first time!

J.K really out did herself with this."
315,316,5,"Harry Potter at Home and the Illustrated Version

Radcliffe and a bunch or other actors read Harry Potter at home and we get to share the experience:
https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/i...

Individual chapter videos:


Radcliffe started with Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived and did a great job.

Chapter Two: The Vanishing Glass was read by Noma Dumezweni. She was fantastic and so much fun to watch, whilst reading it...



Chapter Three: The Letters from No One, read by Eddie Redmayne, very good job! The Dursleys are so abominable! My cheeks were hurting from laughing so much...

Other good ones... Stephen Fry does a great Hagrid! Whoopi Goldberg brought a bit of an American twang to the proceedings... David Tennant was very good. And David Beckham as Lee Jordan, doing the commentary for Harry‘s first Quidditch match, was a brilliant bit of casting. Hugh Bonneville, also a good one... And Tom Felton is a bit of a book torturer, apparently...



Chapter Sixteen... Kenneth Brannagh, very good job!

It was a nice touch for the last chapter to have it read by three different families—one from London, one from NY and the third from Belfast.

Rowling reading the last few pages was the icing on the cake. Difficult with the current controversy about her. Generally though I really liked this read-along via video, keeping pace with the illustrated version.

————


It‘s been ages since I read Harry Potter. More or less when the books were published the first time, in the original UK editions. I ordered myself an illustrated version a few years ago, but never read it. Every now and then I take a look at some of the illustrations — very pretty! Now a friend mentioned Kindle in Motion. It‘s basically the same version as my hardcover, as a kindle and with animated illustrations — it‘s mesmerizing!

I can‘t get over the owl on page 43 and how it moves! So cool... Diagon Alley is so pretty in this!



And I love how the Golden Snitch zoomes around the page, when the crate is opened and Harry gets his introduction to Quidditch!

This is a very nice addition to the illustrated edition. It brings it to life and enhances the already pretty illustrations well."
316,317,5,"Leí esta novela por primera vez hace 19 años. Fue el único que leí después de ver la película correspondiente. Eso debió haber contribuido a que, entonces, lo considerara como el que menos me gustó de toda la saga.

Ahora en la relectura es una historia diferente: me encanta el tono irónico y rimbombante con el que están narrados los primeros capítulos. En ellos se nos cuenta la vida común y corriente desde el punto de vista de los Dursely, y después, esa normalidad se rompe para dar paso a la magia.

Harry no es un personaje que tenga un personalidad muy distintiva. Diría que es un chico como cualquier otro. En parte, creo que esa fue la razón de su éxito: todos los niños y adolescentes cruzan por esa etapa en la que creen que no son especiales y que su vida es aburrida. Todos los que leímos Harry Potter en la adolescencia nos identificamos con él en cierto nivel. Todos quisimos alguna vez romper nuestra monotonía y entrar en su mundo. Yo tenía 14 años cuando leí los primeros libros, pensaba que no podía identificarme con un niño de 11 años, pero aunque tengas 30 o 40 la asociación es inevitable. En aquella época quería ser estudioso como Hermione, quería ser arriesgado como Harry y Ron o buena onda como Dumbledore. Aún hoy quiero ser como ellos, aunque terminé siendo amargado como Voldemort.

La otra parte del éxito viene los detalles mágicos que plagan la historia. A cada vuelta de página la autora nos bombardea de magia. Desde una señora que se transforma en gata hasta un sombrero que habla y razona. Objetos o situaciones de la vida común salpicados con algún detalle sobrenatural. Todos quisiéramos tener objetos o habilidades así.

Yéndome a detalles un poco más técnicos: en mi primera lectura me sorprendió (y aún lo hace) el nivel de planeación que tuvo Rowling de las 7 novelas. Todas las piezas estaban acomodadas. TODO. Me la imagino con mil hojitas de notas tipo: ""aquí mencionaré esto"", ""aquí saldrá este personaje que será relevante en novelas próximas"", etcétera. Aprecio cuando un autor planifica su historia y al terminar te das cuenta de que todo pasó por algo.

En conclusión, me divertí leyendo como cuando era adolescente y descubriendo detalles que no salen en las películas (las cuales volví a ver el año pasado). Agregué este libro a mis lecturas de GoodReads el año pasado y le di 3 estrellas, ahora la cambiaré a 5. No creo que sea el mejor de la saga, pero de verdad fue muy divertido volver a leer ""La piedra filosofal""."
317,318,5,"I'm a huge fantasy reader ⚯͛ , I remember the first time when I got this book I was 9,growing up on this series until today I still get excited like the first time I did read it,this shows how amazing is J.K Rowling writing is, she's just takes us to a world we never been to.

""There is not good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it.""

There once was a boy named Harry,
who constantly conquered death.
But in one final duel between good and bad
he may take his final breath.

The story begins with Harry living with his uncle Dursley after Hogwarts send thousands of messages for Harry, Hagrid finally comes to take Harry with him to Hogwarts and Harry got to know about how he's parents really died and they're stories oh and he got to know he's a wizard too!"

Welp, I guess I'll briefly rewrite:

So! For your consideration, I'll sum up my past review into something more pocket-sized. Basically... this novel skirted around the Breakfast Club hype, I got excited, and then wished for Dudley's watch to ship to me in the mail. In a nutshell. The mic has been dropped. Thank you for coming.

319,320,5,"A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous. He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: ""To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!""

Thank you, J. K. Rowling for making my childhood so awesome. An entire generation of readers (and many more to come) will forever be grateful to you! ♥

I love the adventure and magic of these books, but I especially love the journey we take with Snape's character. He is everything. So hard to love, but I love him for it.

Melissa's review here
-----

The first time I had heard of Harry Potter was when my brother brought home the movie for 'Sorcerer's Stone' ... he wasn't a reader but the movie had appealed to him. It looked interesting to me to so we had a movie night and watched it together.

Michael (my brother) didn't think much of the movie himself... I think he gave it to me afterwards and said nothing else about it. As for me, the movie didn't blow me away, at first. It did get me curious enough to pick up the first book. I remember falling love with everything about it, finishing the book quicker than I had finished one before and immediately hungry for the next one.

At the time, I didn't know popular the series was... I just knew I loved it and had to read them as quickly as possible. By the time I discovered these beautiful books, the first four were already out and OoTP was released not long after... needless to say, I caught on quickly as to how big the fandom was.
I loved the it all though, it felt like a big family :) I loved to hear people swap theories while waiting in line, and soak the whole atmosphere as we all eagerly waited for the bookstore to open (ours never had midnight release parties but they did open extra early).

This is part of my book family :) <3

The question I have to ask myself is not what should I say in this review but what CAN I say that hasn’t already been said by the 4.75 million reviews that proceed mine. And the short answer is nothing. I think everything new that could be said in a review has already been said so I’ll do what so many others have and tell you all about my Harry Potter experience, as that at least will be different from the others.

This series is just so nostalgic for me, and many others of my generation. I didn’t start reading the books until the third one was out and I was eleven years old. I had heard about them, who hadn’t? But I had dismissed them as something I wouldn’t be interested in. However then a family friend, knowing that I was a big reader, asked if I wanted to borrow his copies. I didn’t, but not wanting to be rude I compromised with myself by saying I would just borrow the first book, privately thinking that I would just read a couple of chapters and then give it back saying that it wasn’t my type of book. That way I wasn’t being rude but I wouldn’t have to waste time reading a load of books I didn’t care about.

Anyway suffice to say I got hooked with the first couple of chapters and devoured the whole book in a day. I then begged my dad to give me a lift straight to the family friends house (luckily only a couple of minute drive away) so that I could give it back, and by that I mean I wanted an excuse to go over and get the next two books straight away!

Unbeknownst to me this all happened a couple of weeks before Goblet of Fire was due for release so I had a pleasant surprise when I happened to walk past a shop with a display of them in the window (of which I bought one asap!). After that I joined the many people in counting down for the release of books five, six and seven and queueing up at midnight to get my hands on them.

The first Harry Potter book if read on its own may not seem all that special but it really is the beginning of a brilliant adventure story about bravery, loyalty and overcoming evil. It’s only when you reread this book, knowing how the series ends, that you can really appreciate how clever the first couple of books are. There are so many easter eggs in them, seemingly insignificant details that end up being so vital to the plot as a whole. J.K Rowling is a truly a genius!"
333,334,5,"Wow, well what can I say? It was INCREDIBLE!
I didn't remember it was that beautiful the first time I read it.

Harry is so cute! Everything is new to him and he doesn't know anything about this world. Throughout the story I felt exactly like him, everytime he discovered something new I felt as amazed as him.
Even though I already knew what was going to happen everything was like the first time as I never heard of all of this before.

There were also times when I got goose bumps. When Ron meets Harry and then Hermione... gosh I was like 'you don't what's going to happen to all of you! You will face so many adventures together, prepare yourself!'

As regards the ending, during Dumbledore's speech I was about to cry when he says: . I thought of Neville and how from a vulnerable little kid he becomes a brave and strong man!

Anyway, I am pretty sure that this story will NEVER be forgotten. As for me, it will have a place in my heart."
334,335,5,"Wow!!!
What an adventure! This was just amazing .. I've never read Harry Potter books before
I watched the movies million times and memorized them by heart and I've never ever thought that reading the book will be more fun than the movies themselves but the opposite happened I enjoyed every single word as if I was watching the movie and even more

so many details that weren't in the movie although not mentioning those details didn't ruin the story at all .. The most amazing adventures of all time that makes me as usual wishing to find Hogwarts in real life and be part of it one day :D

I will keep reading the rest of the books I think and enjoy every single word by leaving this world I'm living in to get into this magical world once again"
335,336,5,"This might just be the very first book I've ever read in English. I was in high school at the time. I remember desperately trying to find out the meaning of the word ""tantrum"". Hahaha! The good old days. I need to find the time to reread this series, and its last book. I've never had the strength to finish reading the last one. It launched the year I had my son. It felt too much reading it. I didn't want it to end. That was nine years ago. I think it's high time I read it."
336,337,5,"Read #3: 8-29-2020

Still five stars!

Read #2: 4-13-2018

This is only my second time reading Harry Potter, although I've watched the movies dozens of times. I was afraid that I wouldn't enjoy reading it as much as the first time. I'm so relieved that it was still a five-star read.

346,347,5,"Τρίτη φορά που το διαβάζω και θα αλλάξω την βαθμολογία μου από τρία αστεράκια σε πέντε! Δεν ξέρω γιατί του είχα βάλει αυτή την βαθμολογία αλλά η εμπειρία μου αυτή την φορά είναι άξια των πέντε αστεριών.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Δεν είχα ποτέ την διάθεση να διαβάσω Χάρι Πότερ για πολλούς λόγους. Ένας απο αυτους είναι οτι δεν μου αρέσει ιδιαίτερα η φαντασία σα είδος λογοτεχνίας. Δεύτερο και κυρίοτερο είχα βαρεθεί να ακουώ για τον κόσμο του Πότερ. Σε όποια βιβλιοφιλική σελίδα έχω κάνει λάικ στο facebook κάθε δεύτερο άρθρο του είχε σα θέμα του τον Χάρι Πότερ. Κάθε τι που έβγαινε απο το στόμα της J.K Rowling ήταν ιερό,ε, νυσάφι. Αλλά έλα που έπεσα σε λογοτεχνικό τέλμα και τίποτα δεν μου έκανε και ανοίγοντας το Kindle ήρθα μούρη με μούρη με την Φιλοσοφική λίθο and it was good. Δεν ξέρω τι να πω για αυτό το βιβλίο και τι θα θεωρηθεί σπόιλερ μιας και τα βιβλία είναι πασίγνωστα και οι ταινίες έχουν χιλιοπεχτεί παρόλα αυτά θα προσπαθήσω να είμαι διακριτκή και να μην προδώσω πολλά απο την πλοκή.

Το βιβλίο ξεκινάει αμέσως μετά την επίθεση του Βόλτερμορτ, του πιο ισχυρόυ μαύρου μάγου, στους Πότερς. Η επίθεση είχε αποτέλεσμα τον θάνατο της Λίλη και του Τζέιμς, της μητέρας και του πατέρα του μικρού Χάρι. Ο μόνος που επέζησε ήταν ο μικρός του γιός. Κανείς δεν ξέρει γιατί έζησε ο Χάρι αλλά όλοι θα τον ξέρουν πια σα το αγόρι που έπεζησε και το σημάδι με το σχήμα κεραυνού θα προδίδει πάντα την καταγωγή του. Μέτα την επίθεση ο Βολτερμόρτ εξαφανίζεται αφήνοντας πίσω του ένα ορφανό το οποίο χρειάζεται ένα σπίτι μακριά απο την μαγεία και οι μόνοι που μπορούν να του προσφέρουν ένα σπιτικό ήταν η Ντάρσλι, οι θείοι του Χάρι, ένα μάτσο αντιπαθητικοί άνθρωποι. Έντεκα χρόνια αργότερα ένας τριχωτός γίγαντας εισβάλει στην ζωη του Χάρι για να τον ενημερώσει πως ήρθε η ώρα του να φοιτησει στο Χόγκουαρτς, την μεγαλύτερη σχολή μαγείας. Και κάπως έτσι ξεκινάει ο πρώτος μας χρόνος στην σχολή μαγείας.

Μου άρεσε και δεν το περίμενα. Θα πρέπει όμως να αναφέρω πως ο λόγος που μου άρεσε ήταν το πόσο ""ελαφρύ"" ήταν και λάτρεψα την παιδικότητα που ήταν εμφανής σε όλο το βιβλίο. Με έβγαλε απο ένα άσχημο αναγνωστικό τέλμα! Πάντως γνωστοί μου που το έχουν διαβάσει μου έχουν πει οτι δεν είναι απο τα καλύτερα της σειράς!

Επειδή δεν είμαι παιδί η αναγνώση του βιβλίου μέσα απο τα τριαντάχρονα μάτια μου ήταν πολύ διαφορετική απο αυτή που ίσως θα ήθελε η J.K Rowling. Τα πρώτα έντεκα χρόνια του Χάρι ήταν γεμάτα κακοποιήση που με έκανε να τρίζω τα δόντια μου. Παραμελημένος και παραχωνιασμένος κάτω απο μια σκάλα το μικρό και κοκαλιάρικο αγόρι ζει χωρίς κανένα συναισθηματικό ερέθισμα. Στην πραγματική ζωή πολύ πιθανόν το αγόρι να είχε εμφανίσει πολύ άσχημα στοιχεία στον χαρακτήρα του. Αλλά όχι ο Πότερ. Ο Χάρυ ήταν ένα ευγενικό παιδί, τρυφερό με τους φίλους του και επιθετικός εκέι που χρειαζόταν. Ήταν καλός με μια έμφυτη διάθεση για περιπέτεια αλλά όχι και πολυ έξυπνος. Ο Ρον, ο φίλος του, ήταν ένας πολύ ενδιαφέρον χαρακτήρας. Λίγο ουδέτερος αλλά με καυστικό χιούμορ και την ανάγκη να διακριθεί ανάμεσα στα μεγαλύτερα αδέρφια του, είναι εξαιρετική παρεά για τον μοναχικό Πότερ. Και φυσικά η Ερμιόνη, η πειθαρχημένη. Η διαβαστερή. Η γλυκιά παρουσία που τους μαζεύει τα χαλινάρια αλλά και που είναι πάντα δίπλα τους. Θα ήθελες να τους είχες φίλους σου. Αλλά πιο γλυκούλης απο όλους ήταν ο Νέβιλ. Αχ, το αγόρι μου. Το φοβισμένο, ατσούμπαλο αγόρι. Ταυτίστικα μαζί του! Και δεν θα μπορούσε να λέιπει ο κακός της υπόθεσης. Ο Βόλτερμορτ. Δεν ξέρουμε πολλά για αυτός εκτός ότι μισεί τον Χάρι και ότι είναι πολύ δυνατός. Οι μάγοι τον τρέμουν.

Μου άρεσε το σχολείο και ο τρόπος που το έχει περιγράψει η συγγραφέας. Τα διάφορα μαγικά στοιχεία που μας έδινε κάθε λίγο και λιγάκι ήταν πολυ διασκεδαστικά!

Μπορώ να καταλάβω γιατί τον αγαπούν τον Χάρι. Αν ήμουν παιδί όταν το ξεκινούσα και μεγάλωνα μαζί με τους χαρακτήρες θα ένιωθα το δέσιμο που νιώθουν όλοι. Αλλα όμως δεν είμαι παιδί. Σίγουρα θα τα διαβάσω όλα!"

This time reading I had been so desperate to read this series again, and this clearly had an impact on my reading experience. I was so ready for this book, this is the most I have ever enjoyed this book ever, and so five glowing stars from me.

Follow this link to see my video review of this edition of Harry Potter:

This was a reread for me, though I haven't read this book in several years and of course this was my first time reading this beautiful illustrated edition.

If you don't know the plot of Harry Potter, have you been living under a rock? This book is about a young boy named Harry, who lives with his Aunt Petunia, his Uncle Vernon and his cousin Dudley. They are the worst of muggles, which is wizard language for non magical humans. They treat him badly and make him live in a cupboard under the stairs. Then one day a letter arrives for Harry, he never gets post and so his uncle is quick to snatch the letter and dispose of it. The next day another letter comes, before you know it the house gets inundated with several copies of the letter as more days pass. His aunt and uncle decide to take him away from the house to avoid the letters and so they go to a rainy island to escape in a hut. In the middle of the night a giant named Hagrid breaks the door down and gives Harry a copy of the letter to read himself. Harry discovers that he is a wizard and that his deceased parents were also magical and went to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and that Harry himself has been invited to attend. From here the reader gets introduced to a wonderful magical world as Harry prepares to go to Hogwarts and then attends to have the most adventure filled year of his life so far.

I gave this book three stars the first time I read it and this time I'm giving it five. This may seem like a huge jump, but there are many reasons for this. First of all, reading this story in the illustrated version just added so much to the story, it made it a more magical read and just made it so much more special. Secondly, rereading this story at this time in my life just made me feel so nostalgic and like I was at home at Hogwarts hanging out with all my old friends. I enjoyed this novel back in the day of course, but reading at again now it just had so many extra feelings for me as this is where it all began. This is where everything began for this series, I've read all the books, I've seen all the movies and I've visited the studio tour in London twice. In all this time I have avoided picking up this first book, and when this edition came out, it seemed the perfect time to reacquaint myself with where it all began. I felt so much more emotion and connection with the characters this time around, so of course this all led to a much higher rating.

Reading this book as an adult is just as rewarding as reading this book as a young teenager. I still found the whole world fascinating and I desperately found myself wishing I was a student at Hogwarts, just as I had dreamt as a child. This book isn't as dark as books later on in the series, and this made me find this book slightly more dull when I was younger. This time though, I loved just relearning about Hogwarts and the characters. I loved learning about Quidditch with Harry and about the whole wizarding world that he had missed out on until now.

This story is just magical and the illustrated edition brings the magic even more to life. If you have never read Harry Potter, or you would like to reread it, then I definitely highly recommend you try out this illustrated edition."
348,349,5,"Indeed, it does! And it always feels like coming home as well. 🥰

I've written a number of reviews of very different editions over the years (the House editions, the gorgeous special hardcover edition, my prized possession that is the illustrated deluxe hardcover edition, the regular audio edition and the absolutely stunning ) so this will be a little short.
I mean, surely, by now everybody knows about The Boy Who Lived who discovers he's a wizard and goes to THE most famous school for witchcraft and wizardry where he meets friends and has to face his tragic past while also learning everything from scratch without missing out on all the fun there is to be had.

What makes this so fantastic is that the author addressed tragic events and choices as well as happy ones and no character is perfect (neither perfectly good nor perfectly bad). Sure, the books themselves aren't perfect either (if you want to nitpick), but the FEELING they convey ... *sighs contently* There is a reason why this series is almost legendary by now. The whole story is just cozy .

Not just the thrill of shopping in Diagon Alley, or the quirky sports and other past-time activities of the wizarding world, or getting your very own wand. No. Not even the heartwarming stories of friendship, finding/making your own tribe or the already existing wonderful families (can you say Weasleys?). More than all of that, Rowling managed to address real-life problems cunningly for small (and not so small) readers to grow up with and learn from. She showed an imperfect world with high stakes and the path to being a good person despite making mistakes and the odds sometimes being against you. For example, she taught a lot of people the true meaning of courage (thanks, Neville).

As always, reading this book was balm for the soul - not least because I once again listened to the one and only Stephen Fry and his masterful narration (his Prof. McGonagall is THE BEST).

You might have guessed it by now, I'm going to once again re-read the entire series - the times are definitely calling for it. LUMOS!"
349,350,5,"For this Christmas I decided to give myself over to the magical world of Harry Potter completely. Therefore, I'm looking at the gorgeous illustrated deluxe editions of the first two books, then reading the ""normal"" printed books all the while listening to the audiobooks narrated by Stephen Fry.

Since I have already listened to this first Harry Potter audiobook (back when I was not really into audio versions which is why I stopped), I decided to try the American version narrated by Jim Dale. However, I can honestly say that that version is just ! It's not so much the American accent as I had feared at first because he is toning that down a lot; it's more that after listening to Stephen Fry throwing himself into the roles of the different characters and doing the different voices so brilliantly, any other version sounds in comparison.

The story is so well-known by now that it doesn't really need a summary from me. Suffice it to say that the fantastic way Rowling made the reader plunge into the wizarding world through the eyes of Harry himself comes to life in such a vibrant way thanks to Mr. Fry that sometimes I forgot this was just one man narrating the book. He gave everyone their own voice and nuance and his own quirkiness played a huge part in bringing out the underlying humour of the story. This will always be my favourite edition (apart from the printed version that I will always prefer to the audio version) and it is thanks to this brilliant man."
350,351,5,"As the first book in the Harry Potter series, this book is perfect. Introducing you to the world, forming friendships, and moving the plot along fairly quickly. Nothing is mentioned in this book without having some purpose, even if you don't know what that is right away.
Also, reading this book is a nostalgia for me that nothing else can ever compare to.
I can't remember how many times I've read it now. But if you haven't read it yet, please give it a go. The series is incredible. And if you read and think ""it seems a bit childish for my liking"" push on. Keep going. The next books are even better."
351,352,5,"capolavóro – 1. a. La migliore in una serie di opere di un artista, di uno scrittore, o di un’età, di una scuola. b. Opera (e per estens. anche azione, impresa, comportamento) eccellente in genere.
Ho detto tutto.
Con chi parla di ""buchi di trama"" vorrei fare due chiacchiere (tutte le Tutti i gusti+1 al cerume solo per voi, infamih!).


AH!

Ho piagnucchiato parecchie volte, ma qui mi sono lasciata andare tantissimo."
352,353,5,"So I couldn't contain myself when my soul was plunged into the chasm of boredom. I just picked it up and promised myself to only read a chapter or two .But as you can see I wouldn't be here if I was good at keeping promises . Without knowing it I re-read the entire book!!! I just LOVE the entire HP series ..... Kept me spellbound right from the first book..... Jk Rowling is a really great writer. The way she unfolds the story, describing young Harry's journey in the totally unknown world ... The series is just perfect for any kind of reader... And it holds a special place in my heart as my reading mania began with this series....."
353,354,5,"Tenía tiempo que quería comenzar la saga pero no me animaba,ya que sentía que sería bastante densa y compleja.A penas el año pasado comencé a leer habitualmente así que no tenía mucha experiencia.
Este año me decidí a comenzarlo y me lleve una maravillosa sorpresa.
Amo a Harry,a Ron y al principio no me caía muy bien Hermaionie jeje,pero también ya le tome cariño.
Es bastante ligero y siempre ocurría algo que te dejaba con ganas de seguir 💕💘
Ahora entiendo el furor por estos libros!!!"
354,355,5,"Honestly, I'll admit I was nervous going into my reread. What if it wasn't as magical as I remembered it being? Well, I need not have worried. It was as incredible as I remember it being! And funnier too. Excited to keep on rereading the series!"
355,356,5,"The illustrated edition added so much for me. Jim Kay is a genuis and he's in my brain. I didn't know it was possible to love this series even more, but I'm on to the next illustrated edition."
356,357,5,"Leído en 2018, 2014 y 2000. A cada lectura lo amo más."
357,358,5,"Como siempre, fantástico."
358,359,5,"What can I say... I don't trust people who don't love Harry Potter, because I adore this book and all that magical world. I mean, it's Harry Potter, what not to like :)"

360,361,5,Für immer ganz große Liebe für diese Reihe ♥️
361,362,5,"So nice to jump back into this series! I don't think I've read any HP for about ten years!

This was such an easy read and so many little details from the book I had forgotten!

Loved it!"
362,363,5,I remember reading this in the 3rd grade and loving it so much! Reading it now at 27 I felt the same excitement. I read this to my kids and they both looked forward to their chapter every night!

365,366,5,It's always pleasing to reread a fav 😍
366,367,5,i think rereading harry potter is always going to feel like coming home.
367,368,5,"As soon as the first signs of autumn start to appear – cold weather, PSL lattes in Starbucks (basic I know but I am a sucker for them!) and the slight color change happening on leaves – I am filled with an overwhelming desire to cuddle up on my sofa with a hot drink, candles and a copy of Harry Potter. This year has certainly been no exception!

I don’t think there will ever be another book that gives me the same experience as reading . Don’t get me wrong there have been other books that I have loved ( and spring to mind) but this is the book that really made me fall in love with reading. And if books have taught me anything, it is that you never forget your first love <3

There is a sense of comfort that I find in reading this series, but I don’t think any of them compare to that feeling of being welcomed into the world of witchcraft and wizardry that can be found in the Philosopher’s Stone. I love that feeling of learning about this world along with Harry, and that is one thing that J.K Rowling is wonderful at – creating a fully developed world. I have recently read , who is another master of getting lost in world creation, and it is interesting to see the influence that it must have had on Rowling as it is so subtly woven in her writing.

As with many massive HP fans, I have read lots of headcannon that has changed the way that I look at interpret different scenes in the novel, which means that I take something different away each time that I read the story. And honestly, it just means that it keeps getting better and better. (Don’t get me wrong I know that there are major plot holes and flaws to the series as a whole but it is still wonderful in my slightly biased eyes.)

for my first love who always holds a special place in my heart no matter how many other wonderful books I read."
368,369,5,"⭐️5 Stars⭐️

A magical and captivating plot filled with humour, thrills, fantasy, fun and adventure. Better late than never they say, I’m in my fifties and this is my first Harry Potter book and what a entertaining read no matter how young or old you are!

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first book in the best-selling and most successful book series in history.

At eleven years old an orphaned boy Harry Potter discovers his magical heritage and is invited to study at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is excited for the opportunity to escape his ordinary and dreary life where he is constantly abused by his aunt, uncle and their horrid son.

At Hogwarts he becomes good friends with Hermione, Ron and Neville who together always seem to find trouble he also finds himself enemies! Harry encounters murdered unicorns, trolls, ghosts, baby dragons, flying broomsticks, magic mirrors and learns to overcome evil forces and social obstacles like bullying.

The plot is cleverly constructed to have universal appeal, it's surely loved by children and adults alike. There is so much to write about but read it for yourself. A book that will never outdate."

i really cannot express what this series means to me. this brought me out of a slump when nothing else could.

first read: june, 2019.
my review for this will be simple since we’re all familiar with this novel...

there is absolutely no reason for me not to give the five stars. for what it’s worth, i basically finished this in two sittings. i was never board and my attention never diverted. it did take a bit to get used to jk rowling’s writing style but... that’s the only possible complaint i can muster up.

about a third of the way into this book i understood why this world is so amazing. i cannot wait to finish this series."
370,371,5,"Well, this book was released when I was only 3 years old, and the final one came out when I was 7. Obviously, I was unable to read them then. I wasn't interested in the movies until last year (2014) when I watched them all when I was sick! I never had interest in the books until watching the movie, but I always assumed I would read them at some point. I AM SO GLAD I FINALLY STARTED READING THEM. I LOVE THESE BOOKS SO MUCH. I also can't believe I deprived myself of the amazingness that is Harry Potter for so many years."

UPDATED:
Returning for a second time round with the audio books. I've been struggling to concentrate on books for the last week or so (effects of lockdown maybe?) and as ever, Harry Potter and his world always manages to capture and hold my attention. No matter how many times I've experienced it, it always works its magic. 💖 This time around I don't have to pace myself as I wait for a new credit, so I'm straight onto the next one!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
This is the book I decided to start with on Audible, because for years I have wanted to hear the brilliant Stephen Fry narrate one of my favourite ever stories -- and yes, it was just as wonderful as I had anticipated. The man is a gifted reader - this I already knew, because I had watched him read from his book online, but I hadn't expected the voices, the perfect enthusiasm, or that I would feel so emotional while listening to it.

I'm about 99% sure I was seven years old the first time I read -- a family friend had read the book, loved it, and insisted my grandparents read it. They did, and then my Poppa insisted that read it too - he knew I would love it, even though it didn't have any horses in it, and he was right. I was completely enthralled by it. I can never be certain if it was this or that got me hooked on fantasy, perhaps it was both in conjunction, but I can be certain that it was this book that made me realise all books were worth trying. That reading something unfamiliar could result in discovering magical worlds, characters that felt like real life friends and books that I could read over and over and always find something new to love and appreciate. Whatever was happening in my life, good, bad or neutral, I could get lost in the Wizarding World, wondering what kind of wand I would have, being absolutely assured in the fact that I would be an excellent quidditch player, probably a seeker like Harry, because I could ride a horse decently and surely a broom would be similar? And anyway, I'd be instinctively gifted at it. Again, like Harry. And I would be an outstanding young witch. Like Hermione. I did concede that I probably wouldn't be good at Wizards Chess though -- best to leave that to Ron.

The movies started to be made, and I loved (and continue to love) those too, but there's just more to the books. The characters are more complex -- something I really noticed on this re-read. The dumbing-down of Ron in particular was keenly felt as I remembered just how bright he was in the book vs the films (I still think Rupert Grint was superb though!). The movies have merged into my mental image of the story - I can't picture Alan Rickman as Snape -- he was exceptional in that part and completely obliterated whatever my previous idea of Snape was.

As has been the case during any reread of the series that has taken place since the publication of the final book, I love seeing the way things resonate even more deeply now, the way everything was being put in place so it could all be woven together into one of my most loved books series ever.

This reading experience was quite simply lovely. I had to make a conscious effort to limit my listening to the times when I was doing the chores that had led me to give Audible a try - you know, those things that don't require your complete concentration, but do require you to be physically present, so reading a paperback is inconvenient or even potentially dangerous! If I had allowed myself, I could have just devoted the entire day to listening. Everything about it was excellent, and I'm anxiously awaiting my next Audible credit (I think that's what they are called) so I can listen to the second book!


Updated 2023:
I have now listened to this seven times. It's become my go to if I am feeling unwell or overwhelmed, and I haven't tired of it yet! 💖

And again near the end of 2023:
Returning to this series again. I am reading mostly nonfiction books at the moment, fascinating, but I find myself hankering after a comforting audio book alternative. I listened to most of this first book while I scrubbed my bed-frame, something that is much less dull with Stephen Fry reading a childhood favourite to me! 😂🎧"

...حيث يمكنك ان تتعلم السحر في مدرسة اشبه بقصر الجنيات

تتغير فيها السلالم باستمرار


...حيث تصرخ الكتب عند اسقاطها أرضا


حيث البوابات تحرسها لوحات تنبض بالحياة


و حتى لعبة الشطرنج تبدو بالتأكيد مختلفة


و في حال تساءلت كيف ستكون الرياضة الأكثر شعبية فسأخبرك انه لا وجود لكرة القدم و انما هناك الكيديتش


تعرفت على هاري بوتر من ايام المدرسة الابتدائية صبيحة ذات يوم احد حيث عرضت القناة الايطالية الأولى على شبكتها الأرضية الفيلم... عبثا حاولت فهم ما يجري و اكتفيت فقط بالألفاظ المشابهة للفرنسية و ما لبثت ان غيرت القناة...تراكمت الأجزاء بعد ذلك و في كل مرة اصاب بالكسل من مجرّد التفكير في الوقت الطويل الذي ستأخذه مني هذه المشاهدة...
ثم شاهدت فيلم كريستن ستيوارت ""كامب اكس راي ""حيث كان بطل الفيلم سجين غوانتانمو يتمنى ان تحظر مكتبة السجن الجزء السابع من السلسلة! فقررت ان اقرأ الروايات ثم اشاهد الأفلام...طبعا لولا الكتب القديمة المستوردة التي تباع في اسواق الملابس المستعملة (البالة) لم أكن لأعثر على جزء و احد حيث ان النسخ الانجليزية غير متوفرة و الترجمات الفرنسية على غلائها لن توفي تجربة القراءة حقها ,خاصة لعدم حبي للغة...أملك الى الأن الأجزاء الأربعة الأولى على امل استكمال باقي السلسلة...

بالنسبة للفيلم فقد أبدع فنانو الخدع البصرية في تصوير هاغوارت وفي رسم الكائنات الخيالية اضافة الى اختيار الشخصيات بعناية و تشابه الممثلين الشديد مع وصف الشخصيات في الرواية...غير ذلك و كما ذكرت سابقا فقد اضاع عدة تفاصيل جميلة

الرواية تحتوي على عدة دروس اخلاقية بحكم انها كتبت بدرجة اولى للأطفال ممررة بطريقة مميّزة اضافة الى عدة اقتباسات كتبت بطريقة بسيطة في ظاهرها ثرية في معناها











ختاما انصح بشدة بالاطلاع على هذا العمل ...فليس من باب الصدفة انه حول كاتبته من ام مطلقة تعيش على مساعدات الدولة الى الكاتبة الأكثر مبيعا عبر تاريخ بريطانيا و أول من تجاوزت ثروته المليار دولار من الكتابة.

381,382,5,"El libro que inició todo. Hasta podría decirse que es el libro que sobrevivió, ya que fue rechazado por varias editoriales antes de ser publicado.

Entre ayer y hoy releí este libro. La última vez que lo leí, hace unos cinco años, me había parecido infantil, pero esta vez me pareció adulto y quizás esa sea la magia de Harry Potter, el haber atravesado varias etapas de mi vida y, en las últimas veces que lo volví a leer lo encontré diferente o, creo que sería mejor decir, el diferente soy yo y el libro me acompañaba en todo ese trayecto, porque fue el primer amor y porque siempre deseo volver a él.

La historia está demás contarla, quien más y quien menos, conoce algo de la historia, más allá de que no haya leído los libros ni visto la película, como esa frase casi premonitoria que la profesora McGonagall le dice a Dumbledore al principio de la historia: ""¡Será famoso... una leyenda... no me sorprendería que hoy sea conocido en el futuro como el día de Harry Potter... escribirán libros sobre Harry... cada niño en el mundo conocerá su nombre!""

Me encantó volver a la magia, a los partidos de quidditch y sobretodo, a las enseñanzas de amistad y valor, a la superación de obstáculos y a la eterna lucha entre el bien y mal, y, también, como la vida no es color de rosas, hacer el bien muchas veces consiste en tener que pagar un precio.

Si de algo estoy seguro sobre este libro, es que en el futuro volveré a él, como alguien distinto, con más años, con otros problemas y que no sólo yo habré cambiado, sino que el libro habrá cambiando conmigo."
382,383,5,"Τις φετινές γιορτές αποφάσισα να διαβάσω το πρώτο βιβλίο της σειράς με φόντο το καταστόλιστο δέντρο και πράγματι λάτρεψα την ανάγνωσή του. Παρόλο που έχω δει και τις εφτά ταινίες, δεν είχα διαβάσει ποτέ το βιβλίο και ομολογώ πως ήταν ακόμη πιο μαγική σαν εμπειρία. Από τις πρώτες σελίδες βυθίστηκα στον κόσμο που έπλασε η J.K Rowling και δεν ήθελα να επιστρέψω στην πραγματικότητα, ευτυχώς θυμόμουν ελάχιστα σημεία από την ταινία και είχα αγωνία. Με ενθουσιασμό διάβαζα πως άνθισε η φιλία των τριών παιδιών και πως φρόντιζαν για το κοινό καλό, τολμώντας να ριψοκινδυνεύουν. Ξαναένιωσα μικρό παιδί σαν να φοιτούσα κι εγώ στο Χόγκουαρτς και λαχταρούσα να πάρει όλους τους πόντους το Γκρίφιντορ ώστε να θαυμάσω το λάβαρο με το μεγάλο χρυσό λιοντάρι. Τα αγαπημένα μου κεφάλαια ήταν ''Τα γράμματα από τον Κανέναν'', ''Ο καθρέφτης του Έριζεντ'', ''Μέσα από την καταπακτή'' και φυσικά το τελευταίο μέρος ''Ο άνθρωπος με τα δύο πρόσωπα'' που με συγκίνησε πολύ. Τέλος, οφείλω να αναφέρω πόσο εντυπωσιακή είναι η έκδοση με την εικονογράφηση και τα περίτεχνα κινούμενα μέρη από το στούντιο γραφιστικής MinaLima γιατί συμβάλλει στο να οπτικοποιήσουμε όσα διαβάζουμε.

''Λέγε τον Βόλντεμορτ, Χάρι'' τον διέκοψε ο Ντάμπλντορ. ''Πάντα να λες τα πράγματά με το όνομά τους, γιατί, αν δεν τολμάς να προφέρεις κάτι με το όνομά του, ο φόβος σου γι΄αυτό μεγαλώνει''.

''Δεν είναι κάτι που φαίνεται.. αλλά όποιος έχει αγαπηθεί τόσο πολύ, ακόμη κι αν το πρόσωπο που τον αγάπησε δεν υπάρχει πια, έχει γύρω του μια αόρατη προστασία για πάντα''."
383,384,5,"First of all, this book ought to be the Philosopher's stone, dang it. We Americans are NOT STUPID.
Second of all,this is the book that started it all. It's classic! I first read it in college and I enjoyed it so much, the funny candy names, the characters, the reader is taken along with Harry on a magical adventure they will never forget.
I have read this book, this series many times. The enjoyment of it usually doesn't wane. There's maybe a few minor inconsistencies, but all and all it's just too enjoyable. It's earl grey tea. It's eating a delicious sundae. It's sprawling in your bed on a weekend just enjoying a good book that doesn't nag you, but it entertains you. It's a great book and you can see why JK Rowling went from being a struggling single mother to a kajillionaire because she is just that good.
Not perfect, no writer is, but great enough.



It's still very good. But dang it, I hate that Hagrid got everyone in trouble!"
384,385,5,"I may or may not expose my age here 😂, but I think it’s been...17 years since I last read this?

Sure I remember the gist of the plot throughout the years, but reliving the smaller things was an experience in its own: the funny banter between the characters, Dumbledore’s quotes, and even the protective relationship between Hagrid and Harry (the album with Harry���s parents had me tearing up😭). I can’t describe how happy I am right now having finished this book in so little time like the good old days - it’s been awhile since I’ve had a solid good reading session and this pulled me right out of my slump.

This series really is genius and is something that’s gotten me through some shit so I’ll be giving it 5 starts until the day I die 😂😂"
385,386,5,"<3 <3 <3 <3 <3

5*

I can now say, I finally see what all the fuss is about in these delightfully woven, darling little characters.

Sheesh. I even teared up at Hagrid's present to him. I have discovered that I am beyond a sap.

I just had to add this in because it also made me cry...my goodness...I am a mess with tears over all humanity this year...."
386,387,5,"What can I say about the book on which it is already a lot has been written. The perfect story for all generations of readers. The writer J. K. Rowling draws us into the story of perfect elegance in writing. The story is great, the whole world is great, the characters are great and all in all, the book is perfect. Since I have a whole collection for a long time in possession, I think I will with pleasure to continue reading. The book I would recommend to all fans of sorcery and magic."
387,388,5,"5 STARS ✨
I was really scared i wasn’t going to like this book. Mostly because of how hyped it was and the pressure surrounding me to like it. But to be completely honest with you, it was SUCH A GOOD BOOK. I haven’t felt as cheerful, happy and fully invested in so many characters + a plot all at once in a pretty loooog time. This story deserves everyone’s love and i really can’t wait to continue with the rest of this series."
388,389,5,This is such a wonderful read!! I always love rereading Harry Potter but with the illustrations it just added so much to the story that you get new surprises through the images while reading! This is just fantastic!
389,390,5,"It never gets old to read the first book of Harry Potter; It's always magical like the very first time.
However this time, it was a million times more fantastic because I can't even begin to explain how gorgeous the illustrations are and how more magical they make the story be."

392,393,5,-Mayo 2021. Sexta lectura.
393,394,5,I don't think I'll ever be able to explain how much I love this series
394,395,5,"It was totally epic! I enjoyed every bit of it! Much more epic than the movie if you think about it, really love this book!"
395,396,5,"I've honestly read this book so many times I find it kind of boring. {She did not say that!} I think I need to start skipping this when I do my re-reads for awhile because I have this memorized. *Please be aware that for many of my formative years in middle school and high school I only had access to books 1-4 as J.K. was still tormenting her audience working on finishing her series. So I have read this particular book no less than 100 times - no hyperbole in that statement I swear.*

This is my review of the illustrated version which I found to be an absolute gem and a for all Harry Potter fanatics, such as myself. Before I share some photos of my favorite illustrations here are some thoughts about the overall book:

This may be one of those things that is more of a versus an essential book for reading. It was fun and offered me a whole different experience to reading the book in general, but I'm not so sure I would be so quick to pick it up again for . It is very large and heavy. It is awkward to hold and can be difficult to read if you do your reading in bed (guilty). Like I mentioned, it enhances the reading experience but not completely essential to enjoying the book.

Now, I don't have kids and the last picture book I read was Berenstein Bears. I did personally find the images to be on the darker side and more wacky and whimsical instead of soft and child-like (whatever that means). I feel like these illustrations may appeal to more adults than kids but I don't read to kids before bed or even know what kids like. I don't even have the faintest idea who Jim Kay illustrates for so take that tidbit with a grain of salt.

Here are some of my favorite illustrations so enjoy!


The house in the middle of the ocean.


Harry and Hagrid.


Diagon Alley.


Hogwarts Express - full version of the cover.


Some insanely cool ghosts. (Prob my fav of the book - not sure why I abbreviated those words)


The potions master!



I Hagrid's hut in this book! I would visit this place every weekend too if I could!!!!

So there's that for you! I really just posted all of these for Sean so I hope he enjoys them!"
396,397,5,"Re-read (23 or something like that) in October 2016:

Still a shame magically and wondefully fantastic as always.
I am completye in love with the illustrated edition.
I am sad that some of my personal favorite ""picture moments"" did not get an illustration but I can't tell the talents how they should do their job!

Because what is pictured? It's beautiful!

I love how Kay managed to actually bring the described words into form and color and didn't let himself be swayed by the familiar movie faces!

This book was glorious and exactly what I needed to feel better!



Original review on here from 2015:
Harry Potter is a cult classics for a reason, generations literary grew up with this book series -myself included.

So what really is there to say about this book and this series that others didn't already say?

Instead of talking about the actual book, lets just talk about the specific edition -the Illustrated Edition- instead, because why not?

Its beautiful. Which of course everyone knows already.
I am a bit sad that some moments have not been documents, such as ht ""Sunday. There is no post on Sunday"" moment because who wouldn't have love to see the fat uncle get letters smacked against the back of his head?
Or the entry way of Diagon alley. Or Harry's face when he first sees it. Or the entry way to the Platform. Or the Weasley family all together with their young faces... Or Hermione first introduced standing in the door of looking at harry and Ron.
Not saying that i could have done better -i personally draw worse then wind blowing a piece of dirt across a piece of paper!- but there are some of those iconic moments that ALWAYS pictured and they aren't pictured in this book and because the illustrations are so damn beautiful, i would have love to see those moments.

I loved that Kay didn't draw pictures of the actors but kept to the actual descriptions Rowling gave.
And the colors, the different sizes of the pictures, how they are incorporated into the text... its all a beauty. But this book was glorious. And Kay knows that he is doing when he draws, and i have no idea if Rowling had any say to what he drew or where its as placed- i am guessing she did since she seems to be rather involved in all the Potter projects- it was certainly thoughtout and wonderfully planned and executed.

This is the best version to read in my option and i can not WAIT for the next books and many re-reads to come.
And if in a magical way i will ever have the chance to have children? This will be the version i will read to them and they will learn to read with (lets just be honest here because any kid of mine will first read harry potter in any language they learn!)

So if for some strange reason you have not yet bought and read the Illustrated version of this book? What are you doing with your life and why are you still here reading that, and not going out buying this edition and reading it?"
397,398,5,"This is a review of the entire series and does contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.
A series revolving around dysfunctional teens and paranoid professors including:
Harry Potter~ an adopted, forlorn teenager with a scar that can be mistaken for a strand of hair, yet is infamous due to its origin. He battles nightmares, paparazzi and the Dark Lord almost every alternate day.
Ron Weasley~ Harry's disorderly yet loyal redhead best friend who loves rats and chocolate frogs and irritating Hermione.
Hermione Granger~ Harry's neurotic bestie number 2 who has an IQ higher than Einstein's a.k.a. the brightest witch of her age. She likes punching douchebags and correcting people's pronunciations in her free time.
Draco Malfoy~Moody teenager who is pressured by his folks to continue their family career of being first class jerks and annoying every single being present on this planet for all of eternity.
Luna Lovegood~ Eccentric girl who is never afraid to be herself and has a peculiar sense in fashion.
Neville Longbottom~ Puberty hits this scared boi harder than the *mean girls spoiler* bus that hit Regina George .
Dumbledore~ The wise old headmaster who decided to make Harry Potter's life more difficult by hiding extremely vital pieces of information essential to defeat Voldemort because Harry was :) His ultimate goal in life is to ensure Gryffinndor wins every year NO MATTER WHAT.
McGonagall~ Cat loving professor who questions why she tolerates the above mentioned people every bloody minute.
Hagrid~ Big guy with an even bigger heart who is obsessed with all types of beasts (dragons, huge spiders, centaurs, you name it)
Snape~ The professor that's still not over his ex and has slight anger issues when trying to start a conversation with Harry. His intentions are unclear until the very last minute."
398,399,5,"Oh my gosh, I can't breath. This is EVERYTHING to me. I love this book. Send a doctor please.


I'm pretty sure EVERYONE knows what this is about, so I'm not going to waste my time saying what it's about.

Poor Harry, stuck with Mr. and Mrs. Dursley. And Dudley. WTF IS A DUDLEY! Who names their child Dudley? It's sounds like some kind of candy. Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, you can do better.

I need to enroll to Hogwarts. HOGWARTS IS FUCKING AWESOME! I don't want to be a muggle anymore! I want to be a wizard!

Ron was literally my favorite character. Harry was okay, Hermione was annoying as fuck, couldn't understand what the hell Hagrid was saying, Draco was a prick, Neville was a crybaby, Dumbledore was barely in the book, Snape was a sneaky, dark weirdo, and Quirrell, oh my gosh. WHAT THE HELL QUIRRELL! That ending! Why would you do that! Okay, calm down Steph, calm down. Let me get back to why Ron's my favorite character. HE'S FUCKING AWESOME! He's funny, loyal, and pretty much the best freaking character in the book hands down.

That ending was nothing I expected. I won't spoil because I'm not a prick, but it was nothing I expected, but everything I wanted. See ya. I have to go finish binge reading the series."
399,400,5,"UPDATE 15 OTTOBRE 2022

che strana sensazione ascoltare questo libro con la voce italiana di Hagrid dopo aver saputo della morte di Robert Coltrane 💔 (il libro l'ho finito proprio ieri sera). Ma parlando di Pannofino, la maggior parte delle volte è stato perfetto, ma in alcuni casi fastidioso specie quando fa la vocina stridula di Malfoy.

Poi non posso fare a meno di notare come i film abbiano rovinato il personaggio di Ron renderlo solo scemo, mentre nel libro è un ragazzo intelligente (basta pensare alla partita a scacchi!).

Per il resto niente da aggiungere.



SUL BLOG:

Provo un certo odio nei confronti del primo film. Da piccola mio fratello me lo faceva vedere tante di quelle volte che non lo sopportavo più e ancora oggi, quando lo riguardo, una parte di me lo detesta mentre l'altra parte lo adoro (non a caso, so tutte le battute a memoria). Per fortuna non succede la stessa cosa con il libro e posso dire di aver amato come la prima volta 💖
Non vedo l'ora di continuare la rilettura...

(Silente senza dubbio il miglior personaggio, saggio e bizzarro 💞)"
400,401,5,"Has it been almost 19 years since I picked up this book on a sultry summer afternoon for first time? I feel giddy and excited the same way like the 13 year old me felt, when I read this book out of compulsion and boredom born out of summer vacations. Although I've read this series numerous times, this time however, I got nostalgic of the bygone halcyon days, when life such as it was, was much more simpler.

402,403,5,"When Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone became available for free on an audiobook site this week, I immediately grabbed it and listened to it. I remember reading this book to my middle child, and being enchanted, mesmerized, ensorcelled. Listening to Stephen Fry, this week, I reminisced, feeling that same sense of magic that drew in readers. It still holds up. When I posted on my blog, the Top Fifty Books a Geek Should Read Before Dying, this was number one on my list. This is a Big Time Must Read Recommend for me, and now that it’s available for free, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t. Harry, Hermione, and Ron will forever remain an iconic trio thanks to J. K. Rowling. Regardless of her own political views revolving around the trans community, her ability to write fantasy is in the upper echelon with Tolkien, Colfer, and Gaiman."
403,404,5,"I'm very late for starting this series but I'm glad I finally did!

""It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live""

I think the reason I didn't pick up this book earlier is that I thought it was intended for much younger audience and I won't enjoy reading it. BUT I WAS TOTALLY WRONG!

It is a beautiful start to a magical journey. I loved every single part of this book. There is no way I can write a review to do justice to this book.The story is highly entertaining, with amazing characters and the writing style is very easy to read!"
404,405,5,"Definitely 5/5 stars

“You're a wizard, Harry.”

It's been 14 years since I read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone for the first time. Even if I've read this series a countless of times over the years, I still love it as much as at the beginning. Harry Potter always and forever will be my favourite series. And it's nice to finally read this in English."
405,406,5,"No hay manera de reseñar Harry Potter, simplemente... no hay. A fines del 2015 decidí que quería empezar a releer la saga pero para eso me compré las ediciones británicas y, no sé ustedes, pero la diferencia se nota y demasiado. O quizás es la experiencia de volver a leerlo, no sé. Pero estoy flipando a lo grande y estoy tratando de releerlo lo más lento posible porque no quiero terminarlos a todos muy rápido. Quizás lea uno por mes."
406,407,5,I'm a 22 year old woman and this is my first time ever reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It was everything that people said it was going to be. The world is beyond magical. I feel like a got a better feel of the characters. Neville Longbottom is my fave!

421,422,5,"Wow...nggak kerasa sudah 15 tahun sejak saya kenalan sama Harry Potter dan terpesona pada dunia buatan Madame Rowling ini. Saya tahu kalo saya mestinya bikin review, tapi sebelum itu, rasanya pengen nostalgia saat pertama kenalan sama bocah dengan luka berbentuk petir ini.

Saya pertama ketemu Harry Potter di Bras Basah, sekitar akhir 1997. Saat itu saya sedang asyik memilih-milih buku bekas ketika shopkeeper-nya menawari saya buku ini. Dia berpromosi kalo ini buku bagus banget dan sayang banget kalo ampe gak saya beli. Dia juga bilang kalo Harry Potter ini lagi happening banget di Inggris sana.

Waktu itu saya kenal internet cuma sebatas email dan chatting doang, gak pernah browsing. Saya pun bukan tipe yang langganan majalah ato koran, jadi saya benar-benar gak tahu kalo ada buku berjudul Harry Potter yang lagi booming. Saya malah curiga kalo buku ini adalah buku jelek yang gak laku. Ya logikanya aja, kalo emang tuh buku buagus banget kok udah ada yang jual second-nya di Bras Basah? Dan kalo emang laris buanget, kenapa juga si shopkeeper maksa-maksa saya buat beli? Tebakan saya sih ini buku gak laku dan si shopkeeper mo nepu saya (Oh...how stupid I was).
Akhirnya buku Harry Potter 1 itu saya beli juga karena sang shopkeeper menjamin saya boleh tukar dengan buku lain kalo nggak puas. Dan begitulah awalnya saya kenal sama Harry Potter.

Rasanya saya gak perlu menulis sinopsis buku ini ato bahkan memberi tahu buku ini termasuk dalam genre apa. I mean, seriously? Sudah 15 tahun lebih sejak demam Harry Potter melanda dunia, it's been all over the news. Kalo bahkan ampe detik ini Anda nggak tahu garis besar cerita Harry Potter, berarti Anda emang gak berminat sama buku ini. Then why bothers now? ;)
Jadi lebih baik saya membahas apa yang saya rasakan sewaktu membaca kembali buku ini setelah 15 tahun berlalu.

Yang saya rasa sih ""aura""nya yang beda. Sewaktu pertama baca Harry Potter dulu, teman-teman saya gak ada yang ngeh sama buku ini (yah sebenernya ampe sekarang temen saya yang baca buku ini juga sedikit sih :| ). Jadi saya heboh sendiri, bahas buku ini sendirian (dan dapat tatapan loe-ngomong-apa-sih dari teman-teman) bahkan fangirling pun sendirian . Sekarang ini, berkat GR dan BBI, saya jadi kenal banyak orang yang juga ngefans sama Harry Potter bahkan ampe baca bareng. Jelas vibe-nya beda banget. Dan itu menyenangkan. Horeeeee....saya masuk golongan mainstream .

Yang , saya mengubah pandangan saya tentang Harry di buku pertama. Awal baca dulu, saya beranggapan Harry ini kepo banget. -- itu adalah pertanyaan saya dulu.
Sekarang saya ngerti kenapa.
Seperti yang dibilang Harry, Dumbledore tahu bahwa Harry butuh untuk mencoba melawan karena pertarungan dengan Voldemort itu personal untuk Harry. Gimana pun, Voldemort lah yang membunuh orangtua Harry. Dan Harry sadar kalo Voldemort bisa kembali menyerang dia.

Tapi terutama, karena Harry sadar bahwa kembalinya Voldemort dapat membuat dia kehilangan dunia sihir.
He was nothing in the muggle world. Gak punya siapa pun dan apa pun. Lalu dia menemukan semuanya di dunia sihir : sahabat, kebahagiaan dan terutama : penerimaan. Penerimaan yang tak pernah dia dapatkan sebelumnya.
Gak heran kalo Harry berkeras mempertahankannya. I'd do the same if I were him. I'd fight the nastiest wizard if I have to in order not to let something most precious being taken from me. So I could understand Harry's determination to fight Voldemort even when he's still a kid.

, ternyata saya sudah suka Ron dari buku ke 1 X).
Jangan salah, dari trio itu Ron memang favorit saya kok. Saya suka Ron karena kalimatnya yang witty dan rada sarkastis, belum lagi sindirannya yang tajam. Tapi kualitas itu baru keliatan di buku kedua (ato malah ketiga?). Yang pasti bukan di buku pertama.
Dulu saya gak ngerti apa yang bikin saya bersimpati sama Ron sejak awal. Sekarang saya tahu. Karena Ron orang pertama yang ""menerima"" Harry. Dia gak meremehkan Harry seperti yang dilakukan Malfoy, tapi dia juga gak memujanya secara berlebihan. Dia menganggap Harry sama normalnya dengan dia, and that's enough.

, saya makin kagum dengan persahabatan Ron dan Hermione. They're true bestfriends.
Tanpa ragu Ron dan Hermione menemani Harry untuk melawan Voldemort walopun mereka tahu resikonya. I mean, saya ngerti kesetiaan Ron dan Hermione pada Harry di buku ke-7. They've come a long way. Tapi di buku 1? Saat mereka baru kenal 1 tahun kurang serta belum ngeh seberapa parah kondisinya kalo Voldemort kembali berkuasa? That's great.

, perubahan karakter Neville kerasa banget ya. Neville yang penakut dan gak berani membela dirinya sungguh berbeda dengan Neville di buku ke-7. I forgot how awkward, clumsy and shy Neville was. But let's talk about him on the later book.

, wow...penerjemah Harry Potter ini keren sekali ya.
Saya sudah pernah sih baca versi Inggris dan terjemahan buku ini (untuk reread yang ini, saya baca versi Inggrisnya lagi), dan dari dulu memang saya tahu penerjemahnya emang canggih. Tapi baru sekarang saya benar-benar ngeh..
Mirror of Erised diterjemahkan Cermin Tarsah. Erised yang merupakan anagram dari desire, diterjemahkan jadi tarsah yang anagram dari hasrat. Wow! Dan setelah saya googling, saya dapat info kalo sebenarnya ide Tarsah ini baru kepikir belakangan, menjelang bukunya turun cetak. Karena sang penerjemah berkeras mesti ada padanan yang tepat untuk ""erised"". Dan iya, beliau emang bener karena erised dan tarsah adalah padanan yang cocok.

, hmm....saya tetap gak ngerti kenapa Professor Quirrell gak bisa menyentuh Harry hanya di bagian akhir buku ini? Waktu awal cerita, Harry bertemu Prof. Quirrell di Diagon Alley dan saat itu mereka sudah berjabat tangan. Kok saat itu tangan si Quirrell gak melepuh ya? Padahal sudah jelas kalo Voldemort telah ""nebeng"" di tubuh Quirrell saat itu.

, saya makin kagum deh sama JK Rowling.
Oke...saya tahu kalo JKR emang banyak menggunakan bantuan mitos, legenda ato apalah itu dalam ceritanya. So it's not really original. Tapi toh emang gak ada formula yang benar-benar baru. Yang penting sih gimana Rowling bisa meramu bahan yang ada. And she's really good at it.

Tapi yang sebenarnya keren dari Rowling adalah : dia benar-benar paham karakter pembacanya.
I guess in some points of our life, even if it's just for one time, we ever felt like Harry, who's a misfit and wishing to go to some place new where we could start everything from the scratch or becoming a different people. But not everyone could do that. Apparently Harry is one of those lucky people.
Reading Harry's journey gave me happiness. Happiness that comes from knowing that at least there's one person in this world who could fulfill his dreams. It also gave me some hopes that in the end everything will be fine for me too. If this boy whose life was much more miserable than me finally found what he always wanted, how could I not? :)

Dan Rowling juga dengan cerdasnya memilih setting di Inggris, suatu tempat yang masih bisa terjangkau dan karenanya masih terasa ""dekat"". Bukannya tempat jauh antah berantah seperti di Middle Earth sana, atau dunia magic namun tak terjangkau seperti Abarat. Terlibatnya kaum manusia non sihir (aka muggle) juga tempat-tempat di Inggris seperti stasiun King's Cross membuat cerita ini makin terasa dekat di hati, membuat kita (oke...sebenernya sih saya) berani berharap bahwa suatu saat nanti saya juga bisa dapat..ehem...surat saya sendiri.
Seorang teman saya bahkan sampe mencoba menekan pilar di tempat yang semestinya jadi peron 9 3/4 waktu dia lagi ada di King's Cross dan waktu salah seorang petugas di sana melihat kelakuan teman saya, si petugas bilang : ""You're not the first person who tried looking for that platform."" Bhahak....ternyata banyak yang bermimpi ke Hogwarts eh? ;)

Dan alasan kenapa saya kasih 5 bintang walopun saya mengakui kalo cerita di buku ini masih kalah spekta dibanding buku-buku berikutnya?
Karena ini adalah buku pertama. The one that started it all. Buku ini juga yang bikin saya kenal dan jadi langganan (sampe sekarang) sama sebuah toko di Bras Basah itu. It's always nice to find a new friend because of one certain book.

Lastly, just wanna say this : for you all who feel like you don't fit in, who wished for a magical school, or secret garden or magical cupboard that could open secret passage to magical land and still secretly keeping those wish alive : keep on wishing. Keep on hoping. Who knows, maybe your ""letter"" is on its way now :)"
422,423,5,"First of all I have read this book more times than I can count, literally. I know I've read this first one at least twelve times because that's how many copies of it I own, but that is a gross underestimate because many of those copies I have read multiple times (especially the battered paperback I still have from 1999). I also used to re-read every year, and every time a new book in the series came out, so I've read this one the most. My OCD is crying inside because I didn't keep track of what books I read and how often as a child. I have to stop dwelling on this. My point is, I have reviewed or written about this book a lot, so this time around, instead of doing an overview (which sounds completely overwhelming), I'm just going to pull quotes, random little things I notice while reading.

I wanted to start 2019 off auspiciously, and I really wanted a re-read, so what better way than to make this my first book of the year? My plan for now is to start February-July off with each subsequent book in the series, so this way I have will have many auspicious months. My magical thinking is strong.

Lastly, if you haven't read Harry Potter yet (why?) this review probably won't be much interest to you. I'm basically just going to spoil things and talk about things in minute detail with no context or explanation.

- - -


Just wanted to highlight this little bit because of the way she describes Hagrid using objects you wouldn't think could be used to describe a human-shaped person. Dustbin lids and baby dolphins. Bless.


I feel like this is Jo posting a warning sign on her book for all Dursleyish people who also don't approve of imagination to GTFO.





I just think this is really sweet. He meant to say thank you but couldn't. And later, the same thing happens to him when Hagrid gives him the photo album with all the pictures of his parents, only that time he's struck entirely speechless.






I have always loved Harry's reaction here. I don't know why.






Little moments like this were almost completely removed from the films, and that is why they will always be inferior. These books have such sly bite at times.












Such blatant Hufflepuff dismissal goes on in this book, by almost everyone. As a quintessential Hufflepuff, this greatly upsets me. Also Slytherin gets a bad rap, but at least that's SOMEWHAT justified. And did we ever figure out for sure if this line was Jo mistake or a Hagrid mistake? Because Sirius Black was in Gryffindor, and at this point, they think he went bad.



HERMIONE, NOT YOU TOO.




Harry is sassy af. This will continue throughout the series.


For some reason, the very first time I read this book, this paragraph gave me a nightmare. I was so upset about someone trying to make Harry be a Slytherin. Maybe I was just feeling guilty because I'd stolen the book off my sister's bedroom floor and never gave it back.


I legitimately think about this line all the time.


Voldemort is in that turban, so the Weasleys are throwing snowballs at his face. #NeverForget






Neville is the most precious gumdrop of a person.


Okay, so here is something I've been low-key upset about for years, and I would be interested to hear thoughts. What are the ethics, exactly, that are involved into either turning a live mouse into a snuffbox (which would be killing the mouse, yes?) or turning a snuffbox into a mouse (which would be creating life???). I just picture all these eleven year old children casually murdering mice and then worrying about how pretty it is, and not grappling with the reality of just having killed a living being??


I'm really glad she moved away from using this phrase to describe Voldemort and his side of the conflict. Too much Star Wars connotations to be taken seriously.

Thank you for reading this pointless, rambling post."
423,424,5,"""Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.""
Very true, isn't it?

My words while reading: stunning, terrific... (can't stop myself from praising this book)
One of the best books ever! My emotions are still in the influence of this book's ending. What a great book and the ending it was!


--- Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
One of the finest school for wizards and witches to learn magic. I liked it very much. It is very well written.



,

--- An orphan child. He lives with his uncle and aunt (), who don't tell him he is a WIZARD! Even though they knew it.

--- A very appealing and effective character. I liked him very much.
One thing I didn't like about him:




--- One of Harry's best friends.

--- A good one. I also liked him almost as much as I liked Harry.


Bio
--- Also one of Harry's best friends. She has a very brilliant mind.

--- Actually, I didn't get any feelings while reading her. I don't know why? Although she is very well written. But I liked her dialogues with Ron. That's sort of...HUMOROUS.



--- A bad wizard. Main antagonist of this series, I assume and the killer of Harry's parents. He also tried to kill Harry but couldn't and He vanishes after that and nobody knows where he is?

--- He seems a powerful antagonist I will ever read. he didn't appear much. This book just gives us the introduction of his existence. But I am sure I will enjoy reading him in the next books.

Albus Dumbledore(Headmaster of Hogwarts) and Hagrid(Keeper of Hogwarts). Both of them seem nice persons to me.



Harry finds out he is a wizard when Hagrid gives him the letter from Hogwarts for admission. Harry's life changes completely while studying in Hogwarts when they() run across the forbidden section of the 3rd floor of Hogwarts.


:




Everything! from beginning to ending except for one minor thing ().


I liked this sport a lot. When I came to know about it I thought ""Author will skip this and announce the winner"" BUT author wrote this sport in such a brilliant way that I want more on this sport. There is a book on this and I will read that book soon.


Just one line: ""Anyone can betray anyone.""

This book contains a good deal of very entertaining scenes. I liked the imagination of author.


()


This book took little long time to introduce Nicolas (
), 2 chapters (). I couldn't like it much because Harry was wondering he had heard/read that name before but he didn't remember it right now. I can understand. BUT 2 CHAPTERS! Seriously! Even though we knew where Harry had read that name. In the train when he was coming to Hogwarts. It didn't look good to me or I couldn't find any fair reason to make this topic that long.I didn't completely hate that fact. I liked it but not that much I liked the whole things in the book.



Everyone should read it regardless of their tastes, I mean, favourite genre. I don't think there would be a person on this planet () who would dare to hate this book. I have become a very big fan of this series. It is not a surprise who wouldn't be. I highly recommend this book to those who hasn't started reading. This book would be a great start for them.



I must say author has done a good deal of hard work. She wrote every scene in such a way that there would be no need of any visual form of this. I could visualize every scene of this book very easily while reading. I didn't thought I would read this type of writing style after Rick Riordan's. She is on second position in my list of Author's-Writing-Style. SORRY! I can't replace Rick Riordan's style with anybody's. I liked his style more than anybody's. I am really looking forward to read Parcy Jackson series BUT you know, 2 series of 10 books () is more than enough books for me to read right now. BUT Sooner or later I will read that series too.

According to fact I mentioned above, I would like to give:








""He didn't know what was going to - but it had to be better than what he was leaving.""

""...hard work and pain are the best teachers...""

""Petrificus Totalus!""

""It was one of those occasions when the true story is even more and exciting than the wild rumors.""

""...you couldn't have everything in life.""

""'The truth' Dumbledore sighed. 'It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution."""
424,425,5,"Nikada u životu nisam doživeo ovako magično čitalačko iskustvo. Ovo izdanje Hari Potera je perfektno. Jako me čini srećnim činjenica da Hari Poter tako aktivno nastavlja da bude deo mog života. Sa 8 godina sam krenuo sa čitanjem knjiga i gledanjem filmova. Sa 17 sam pogledao poslednji film. Unazad devet godina ponovo čitao knjige i kupovao nova izdanja, a sada sa 26 hvatam sebe u prevelikoj radosti jer znam da ću narednih sedam godina iznova osećati uzbuđenje vezano za magični svet, jer je MINALIMA studio već najavio da je drugi (a i ostali) ilustrovani deo u pripremi. Magija se nastavlja, and I’m sooooo looking forward to it! To Harry Potter, the boy who lived! ⚡️"
425,426,5,"This is where it all started. With a boy who lived. With a cat that looked like she was wearing glasses, that sat all day and watched muggle's house until a giant on a motorcycle brought a baby all bundled up to their front door. ...

With a kid that lived under the stairs, the one who beat the One who Must Not Be Named.

And here we are, 20+ years later. How the time flies in the muggle world...and yet it somehow stands still for all of us, who go back to these amazing books time and time again.

Reading Harry Potter is like eating your favorite childhood food, the one memory that takes you back and makes you smile even on the crappiest of days. Like in Ratatouille when Ego takes a bite from that famous dish and suddenly, he is a kid again and his mom making him his favorite food and making his bad day all-right.

Harry Potter is a food for soul, like a warm blanket that you get to snuggle in on a cold day, while drinking the best hot cocoa out of your favorite mug.

And that could be it to summarize the story, but it is not :)

Of course, purely because of nostalgia and what a phenomenon HP is, it is definitely 5 stars. Yet, it doesn't come without some minor annoyances.

Minor Annoyances:
Yes, Harry is a bit of a lug. But given the fact that he was wearing hand me downs from fat Dudley, went to some crappy school and spend most of his time alone, he definitely didn't have a chance to develop the social/mental skills of his peers. Plus Vernon, Petunia and Dudley are one of the most awful families to foster a child. That is related to them at that. They could have made Harry a brother to Dudley, but because they had tiny brains and were wizard haters, they sucked balls as foster parents, which is a shame.

The entire forbidden forest plot - I understand it was necessary for Harry to be in that forest to see Voldy drinking unicorn blood (which is still gross as hell), but:
a) Dumbledore strictly prohibits ALL students to go there and yet, under aged kids just wander around IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, by themselves through the darkest parts of the forest. They are scared as hell and rightfully so. They have wands, but I don't think you can fight werewolves with a Wingardium Leviosa spell.
b) Hagrid would never let Harry and Draco wander alone out there. He of all people would know all the freaky creatures that lurk inside the forest. Yes, he has a penchant for scary creatures to call pets, but still. He is a half giant. These are tiny, clueless kids who learned maybe like two spells at best at this point.
c)Going through a scary forest that is called THE FORBIDDEN for a reason as a punishment for sneaking outside of a castle after curfew kind of beats the whole purpose. It's like if you came home late and drunk and your parents wait for you with the lights off until you sneak in, then tell you that you have to go back out there and party harder and drink even more and maybe smoke some cigarettes while you are at it. Makes no sense. Sorry.

Also, someone else already mentioned this, but I really miss Neville in the movies. The movies definitely did him wrong by excluding him from the story and pushing him to a ""minor"", supporting character at best. In the book, he is very much involved. He is the one, who has to go to the dark forest with Harry, Hermione and Draco. But alas, someday we will get a better version of the story on our screens.

Other than that, HP is the bomb and I love reading it again and again and again and again. Classic and timeless."
426,427,5,"What a perfect book to listen to! My sons loved the Harry Potter books and still do. When I was trying to figure out what to listen to next, one of them suggested I listen to these books and I am so glad I took his advice. Will definitely be continuing this series. Now I get it- I know why these books are so loved.

I felt like my inner child had a chance to emerge again.

Published: 1997."
427,428,5,"I remember when this series was everywhere, I never got around to reading the books but I remember following the movies and I love the movies, after years of procrastinating I decided to give the book series a try and I’m glad I did. Since I watched the movies before reading the books, I can’t help but compare the both.

One thing is for sure, the movies did a good job but the book is way better than the movie, they cut off some vital parts that are very important to the progression of the plot and character development, I understand why they did that but I don’t have to be happy about it.

The book began with the death of Harry’s parents, we saw how that affected the wizarding community and how he came to live with the Dursley’s. To say his uncle and aunt are horrible people is an understatement. The book features lots of his childhood with the Dursley’s and his admission into Hogwarts where it all began. I love how all the students are in different houses, brings back memories.

I love the world, it’s kind of like urban fantasy with it’s own twist, it’s contemporary but the wizards have their own world where they live in a sort of fantasy world where magic and mythical creatures live. The writing is straight forward which isn’t surprising since it’s a young adult book. The book is written mainly in Harry’s third person POV with a few by other characters.

The magic system isn’t exactly original, the author gave a new twist to something we’re familiar with, it’s usually elemental magic with spells and the like thrown in. The depiction of the magic system was well done.

So far I love all the characters in this book, even Draco the bully, they are all so well written. I still can’t decide on a favorite, I’m torn between the three friends, Hermione, Ron and Harry.

Harry is the weird one who knows nothing of the wizarding world but somehow survived the worst villain they had even seen as a baby, they all know him but he is lost but slowly finding his place.

Ron knows all about the community but he has very big shoes to fill, his brothers are big names so everyone expects him to be as good as them, being poor doesn’t help.

Hermione is the know it all, she’s very smart and though new to the world have read all there is about it, meeting her helped Harry and Ron’s academics big time.

Then there’s the Weasley twins, George and Fred, Percy, Neville, Hagrid and many other awesome characters."

429,430,5,"Harry Potter changed my life.

I don't say this lightly.

I was very young when I started reading these, I was 9. The librarian at the elementary I was attending pulled me aside and gave me this book to take home to read, her own personal copy, because at the time Harry Potter hadn't been read and approved for the library yet. She may have broke some rules at the time, but I'll bet she doesn't know that breaking that rule made me who I am today.

This story is magical. Literally. I re-read this series every year. Every September. Sometimes twice a year if I feel the need. No matter how old I get, when I pick up these books I feel like a kid again. You don't have to be a kid to love Harry Potter, you don't have to like fantasy to like Harry Potter, you don't even have to be a big reader to love Harry Potter. All you have to do is open your mind (and your heart :').)

Please pick up one of these books if you haven't yet. I don't care if you're 6 or 60, they will enlighten you to a whole new world. They will make you feel happiness, sadness, anger, all of the feelings, all of the time.

I remember begging my mom to tell me all the stories about Harry Potter when I was only 5 years old. Little did I know this book series would turn out to be such a huge part of my life. This book was the book that got me into reading when I was 7 years old, it made me want to live a life full of adventures and it definitely changed my life to the better, even at such a young age.

What I loved right from the start was J. K Rowlings kind of way to tell to her stories. I was, and still am, absolutely amazed by the magical world she created. Reading this book, or better said this series, made me feel like Hogwarts was my second home, it made me feel like I could escape reality and dive into a whole different world. I think that's what made me fall in love with reading.

Another thing I loved was definitely that the friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione became quickly the center of the story and remained the center through the entire book series."

Firstly of all, I didn't own the books and I can't just buy so many books like that, ain't nobody got the money for that. But then I finally got them as e-books and the thing that stopped me was that there were so many of them. I was just scared to get started But since you all kept reading them and kept on rating so highly, I decided to see if it was really true. And god, I'm so happy I finally did it.

This book was very good! even though it was written so long ago and I've seen the movies, it just never gets old does it? I loved the writing and the concept. It still keeps me wishing that I could be a wizard someday, no matter how old I get. I was already a fan of Harry Potter before reading this, because of the movies. But since I didn't dare to call myself a real one until I read the books, this is going to be my start of reading all of them. I'm excited."

A venit în sfârșit momentul când pot face și eu o recenzie pentru una dintre seriile mele preferate: Harry Potter. Primul volum al acestei serii scrise de J.K. Rowling se numește Harry Potter și Piatra Filosofală și a apărut recent la  sub o nouă traducere care îi aparține lui .

Nu am mai citit cap-coadă în de câțiva ani buni, dar aceea este traducerea cu care eu am crescut și care m-a atras, în ciuda părerilor negative. Ajunsă acum la o vârstă, și trecută prin mai multe cărți, pot spune într-adevăr că traducerea unor nume proprii dintr-o limbă în alta, fără a se face referire la numele originale, nu este un lucru bun întrucât se pierde din farmecul creat de autor.

 revine cu o traducere mult mai bună din punctul acesta de vedere, numele proprii sunt la fel ca cele din engleză (și nu , și nu , și nu , etc.).

Am auzit o serie de despre cum nu era una corectă cu privire la ce am menționat mai sus, dar și deoarece existau pasaje din cartea originală care nu au fost traduse în întregime. Eu nu am apucat să citesc seria (este în proces acest amănunt), așa că nu pot spune cu certitudine acest lucru, dar adevărul este că am avut senzația că traducerea veche era un pic cam simplistă, ca și când lipsea ceva pe alocuri.



de la este , și pot spune că după ce am făcut o , această nouă ediție este mult mai recomandată fiind una completă și corectă, sensul ideilor din engleză nepierzându-și originalitatea.

Întâlnim și aici o serie de traduceri de care sunt sigură că sunteți curioși: (nope, Severus Plesneală nu mai există, în cazul în care vă întrebați; Severus Snape a rămas și în traducere - , în traducerea veche), (, sau după traducerea veche), (, în traducerea veche), (, în traducerea veche), (, în traducerea veche),  (,  în traducerea veche), etc.

Aceasta a fost o selecție de denumiri care mie mi-au sărit în atenție mai mult. Unele dintre ele îmi plac cum sună și în noua traducere, multe îmi plac și în traducerea veche. Cu toate că majoritatea numelor proprii nu au fost traduse, am observat și mici excepții.



Revenind la , pentru că nu am apucat să vă zic nimic încă! Această este una . este una dintre lumile care m-a fascinat în copilărie, cărtile și filmele fiind prietenele mele care mă amuzau și mă linișteau de fiecare dată.

447,448,5,"I've only just read this. Have I been hiding under a rock? No. I enjoyed the films and I just read this to my 9 year old daughter. The thing is, when this came out it was the perfect time for me to NOT read it. It first came out in 1997. At the time I was twenty and wasn't really reading much. I was spending most of my time smoking cigarettes, drinking and rocking out with our band - 'The Liability Crisis'. At that time I probably ONLY read Terry Pratchett. I also think I wouldn't have enjoyed this back then - why? It reads like a children's book. It's a happily ever after story, which is right for it's target demographic, but wouldn't have been right for 20 year old me.

I actually really wanted to find this book a bit 'meh'. Why? The hype. It's a best-selling novel, it's had a massively successful series of films made . Am I jealous? Well, a bit... But it's more complicated than that. When a book is so successful, you expect it to have stand out qualities.

Right off the bat, I wasn't blown away by the writing. It was fine. It was perfectly serviceable, however I understood what the Guardian was getting at when it quoted on the front of 'Rowling can type, but Le Guin can write.' Le Guin uses a lot more nuanced, and poetic language. They read as more high-brow than Rowling. However the writing in Potter is probably exactly what you want, no more no less. It isn't going to win a Pullitzer prize, it's not likely to go down in history as the greatest piece of english literature of all time. It's fine, but it's not really 'stand out'. At least not for me.

Okay, so what about originality? I didn't really feel at any time that this story was entirely original. I'm cheating because I've seen the films, but Voldemort is a fairly typical disembodied 'Dark Lord' I suppose his origins are a little interesting, but Tolkien really did the disembodied Dark Lord thing to death with . Horcruxes? Basically the way I interpret it, the One ring of LOTR was basically a Horcrux. It almost reads like Rowling thought, 'Ooh, that's a good idea! I know I'll not only steal the idea, but I'll stick two fingers up to Tolkien, call it a Horcrux and have seven or eight of the things!' The thing is; that worked for the story. Instead of a quest to destroy the One Ring we have a several quests!

The whole children vanishing off to have magical adventures battling evil. That kind of stank of C.S. Lewis '. Yes, the school setting is kind of interesting, and the dichotomy of Harry's horrible life with the vile Dursley family is kind of fun....

The bottom line is though, Harry Potter - at least to me - isn't 'stand-out original'. It's more a clever blending of previous ideas with a few tweaks, twists and subtle changes. Not that that's a bad thing. To me that's the norm! Stories need some previously used elements. Readers feel much more engaged when there's an element of familiarity in the story.

By this point, you probably think you're reading the wrong review. I gave this five stars, but I'm not writing like I'd give it five stars.

The writing and the originality aren't bad things. I wouldn't mark the book down for these aspects, it's just they aren't 'stand out'. They're just what you expect to me. For me, the strength of this book and probably the reason it translated so well into film is the characters and their interactions. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Snape... Even the less prominent characters they seem real and likable. They're all easy to engage with. They are also distinct and have their own easily identifiable characters. The dialogue too, for me was very strong. For me the magic of Harry Potter and the reason for it's enviable success is really the characters and their interactions.

It won't be for everyone. Though there are a few 'dark' moments, all in all the book is a happily ever style tale with no major characters meeting their untimely ends. It isn't what I'd call gritty, but again that makes it a good fit for the target demographic.

I was impressed with the dynamic of Snape and the mystery of his intentions. I will say though, the waffle about him hating Potter but saving him stuff at the end - it felt a bit clumsy. Foreshadowing the truth about Snape whilst keeping the resolution secret was always going to be difficult if not impossible. Ultimately it doesn't matter. The parts of this book that are hard to put down, the parts that make you want to keep turning are the parts where Harry, Ron and Hermione... Even Hagrid, Dumbledore and McGonagal...

So if you missed it first time around like me, because you were at the wrong stage in life to appreciate it - pick a copy up and read it to your kids! You never know, you might enjoy it just as much as they do! :)

448,449,5,"I didn't kid when I said that I was a Slytherin, and starting this review, I feel my dark influences even more plainly. Because the truth is, I've loved Harry Potter with all my heart for over 15 years, and for this reason, I won't change my 5 stars rating, but perhaps I shouldn't have reread this first book. I wouldn't go as far as saying that I'm disappointed, because the magic isn't gone, and I'm still wiping off the stars stuck in my eyes, mesmerized by all the creatures and fantastic ideas brought to life.

. Don't hate me, but GAH, I didn't remember Harry, Hagrid and Ron being so short-minded sometimes. Is it because I already knew the ending? Perhaps. Surely, it must be that. Also, I love Snape and Draco - who's a little shit in here, I do realize that - and they're rather seen as one-dimensional assholes for now. I also LOVE HERMIONE, and felt just as annoyed as the first times when Harry and Ron dismissed her so easily.

Anyway. It doesn't change a thing, really. I'll still love this series to pieces and read it to my pupils for the years to come. I've always preferred the next books anyway, starting with .

450,451,5,"This read was a 'read it out loud to the kids"" affair and I can review it like this - on a Saturday afternoon they all kept saying ""one more chapter dad"" until both the book and the afternoon were done, and then we watched the film adaptation.

J.K. Rowling's much loved books don't need another review from me as everything that can be said about them has been. The real pleasure of them is to read through them and see that they fully deserve the place they have. They are genuinely universally appealing stories that inthrall both adults and children alike while wonderfully taking on themes such as standing up to adversity, building meaningful friendships and not judging people on first appearances.

These books also treat there younger audiences with great respect and focus on a well written story rather than 'dumbing it down' to make sure everyone understands - the result is that the quality of the story keeps all readers engaged. The upside of this is the great fun that we had reading the book together - bring on six more of them."
451,452,5,"Y de repente me encuentro con una nueva aventura por vivir. Algo tarde quizá, pero bueno, ya saben lo que dicen, mejor tarde que nunca. Con suma honestidad, voy a admitir que le tenía un poco de miedo a la idea de iniciar la saga de Harry Potter. No me explico bien por qué, pero suelo darle la espalda a las sagas, soy una persona muy despistada y temo olvidar detalles importantes, y no quisiera que todo perdiera sentido por algo así. Pero creo que la magia de las sagas está en seguir el hilo, llevar la historia con atención y con entusiasmo, dejando cualquier inseguridad atrás y permitiéndote conocer mundos nuevos. Realmente estoy ansiosa por continuar con los libros de Harry Potter, y supongo que pronto lo haré ya que me resultó muy entretenido el primero."
452,453,5,"I won't write a full review on this book because I'm not sure what to say. Lol. I've read this book so many times, it an amazing book and series that I'll still be rereading in 30 years and possibly even my grandchilren. It been more then 20 years since this book came out and children are still reading it for the first time and falling in love with the same way we did.

I hear alot about how its a kids book meant for kids. If you feel this way than you truely don't belong with your nose in this book. There is something for everyone of all ages in this series."
453,454,5,"The MinaLima team designed the look of the Harry Potter movies, and I have loved their editions of classics, so I knew this would be great. And it was. Jewel-like illustrations, giving it the look of an illuminated manuscript, special features like fold out maps, Dumbledore's pocket watch, and Quirrell's turban made it especially fun as a read aloud. The paper itself is heavy and faintly tinted like parchment, each page decorated along the edges. We have the illustrated edition, but this is even more spectacular!"
454,455,5,"""To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.""

This edition of Harry Potter and the the Sorcerer's Stone is absolutely gorgeous. It enhances the story in all the best possible ways. Rereading this book is like coming home after a long stressful day. It welcomes you with open arms as if you've never left.

465,466,5,"""سوف يصبح شهيراً.. أسطورة.. وقد يسمى هذا اليوم في المستقبل باسمه، وستؤلف حوله الكتب، سيعرف كل طفل في عالمنا من هو هاري بوتر""

كنت أتفاجأ دوماً من رد فعل أصدقائي طوال مراحل حياتي الدراسية وحتى في العمل بعد التخرج عندما أخبرهم أنني لم أقرأ أي جزء من هاري بوتر ولم أشاهد أيضاً أياً من أفلامه فيحدقون بي في ذهول تام ⁦🤷🏻‍♀️⁩
ربما لم يكن لذلك سبباً معيناً وربما هو من حسن حظي أني ادخرتها لهذا الوقت، فأنا من عشاق الفانتازيا ومن عشاق كتب الـ Young adult أيضا، خاصة تلك التي يكون لها أبعاد إنسانية ملهمة تشعرني بالتوحد معها، فما بالنا بأكثر وأشهر سلسلة عالمية تضم الإثنين معاً؟

ولكن أخيراً وبعد العديد من التأجيلات التي كانت تشعرني دائماً بأنني لازلت أحتفظ بمتعة وسحر لم أطرق بابهما بعد، اتخذت القرار وقررت الانضمام لفريق البوترهيدز.. مرحباً بكم في عالم هوجوارتووس الساحر، من فضلك اخلع منطقك على أعتابه، فالمنطق سُم الخيال 🧙‍♂️🔮⁦🤩
""أستطيع أن أعلمكم كيف تعبئون الشهرة في زجاجات.. والمجد.. وحتى الحياة""
لا أعلم ماذا يمكن أن أكتب عن هذا الجزء فأعتقد أنه لا يوجد أحد لا يعلم قصة هاري بوتر الرضيع الذي قتل أحد السحرة الأشرار من قوى الظلام والداه اللذان كانا من أنجب تلامذة مدرسة هوجوارتووس العريقة لتعليم السحر والشعوذة، والذي انتقل بدوره إليها في سن الثانية عشر ليكمل مسيرة والديه ويسير على خطى عظام السحرة ويصنع المجد (بالمعنى الحرفي للكلمة)، وذلك بعد أعوام قضاها في عذاب ومعاناة في بيت خالته وزوجها وابنهما المدلل السَمج..

""هناك أنواع مختلفة من الشجاعة، هناك شجاعة نحتاجها للوقوف في وجه الأعداء.. لكن، نحتاج إلى أكثر منها للوقوف في وجه الأصدقاء""
ربما لم أرى هذا الكتاب مجرد قصة خيالية عن طفل ساحر ومدرسة تعليم سحر وكتابة غارقة في عالم الأحلام والخيال ببراعة شديدة، ولكني وجدت ما هو أبعد من ذلك، وجدت كيف يمكن أن يلعب القدر لعبته الرابحة في حياتك حتى يساعدك لكي تعيش حيث تنتمي، وحيث يجب أن تكون، وحيث تجد التقدير والعرفان، وجدت ما معنى أن يعرف الإنسان ""حقيقته"" ويجد نفسه بها، بعد أعوام من المهانة والتهميش وسوء المعاملة.

لا يمكنني إغفال جانب الصداقة الرائعة البريئة والشُجاعة في نفس الوقت بين هاري ورون وهيرمايني التي وجدت بها الكثير من شخصيتي، وكيف أن الصداقة الحقيقية في أي مرحلة من عمر الإنسان يكون لها مفعول (السحر) بالمعنى الحرفي للكلمة أيضاً..
""هناك أشياء عندما يشترك فيها الناس تنتهي بأن يصبحوا أصدقاء.""

لم أستطع أيضاً أن أتخطى ""هاجريد"" ذاك الجسد الضخم والمظهر المخيف الذي يحمل في داخله قلب طفل سرعان ما يذرف الدموع لأبسط الأسباب، ملاك هاري الحارس الذي لا يمكن إلا أن تحبه ⁦♥️⁩
وبالطبع الأب الروحي ""دمبلدور"" الشخصية الحكيمة المنصفة ذات العقل الراجح والدهاء الماكر في نفس الوقت، الشخصية التي يحفظ شكلها الصغار والكبار من الأفلام الخاصة بالسلسلة، وجدتني أقول في نفس يا ليت دمبلدور موجود بالفعل في عالمنا.. ⁦♥️⁩
""لا تجري وراء الأحلام وتنس أن تعيش الحياة""
""رغم أن أكثر شيئين يريدهما الإنسان هما المال والحياة، فإن البشر دائما ً يختارون الأشياء التي تضرهم""

أخيراً لا يمكنني القول إطلاقاً بأنني تأخرت في دخول عالم هاري بوتر، بل بالعكس لقد جاء في وقته الصحيح تماماً وربما لو كنت قرأته وأنا طفلة أو وأنا مراهقة لم أكن لأستمتع به ويلمسني إلى هذا الحد.. فنحن في كبرنا نحتاج لكل المعاني الموجودة فيه أكثر من الأطفال..
""فالحب يا هاري يحوّط الإنسان ويحميه إلى الأبد حتى لو رحل الشخص الذي أحبه عن الدنيا""

وها هي المحطة الأولى انتهت وأنتظر بفارغ الصبر رحلتي الثانية مع حجرة الأسرار :)

466,467,5,"Here's the thing, I reread this series every single year. Why? Not just because I absolutely love it but because it sparked my intense immersion into literature. This book changed my life. Melodramatic much? Sure. Honest? 100%. You need to know that I have always been a reader. I started reading before I was 3 and around the same time starting telling my own bedtime stories. Not kidding. I didn't allow my parents to read to me before bed. They were required to listen to a story I told before I'd go to bed. I read all the time. I always asked for more books. Bigger books! So I read everything from your classic kids picture books to full chapter books. It wasn't until Harry Potter though that I became fully engaged in a world. I needed to know what was next! I felt for the characters and I understood them!!! I remember all the hype surrounding the third book in elementary school- how everyone around me talked about ""the boy who lived"" and how super excited they were about the book and how long they had to wait for it through the library. It was at this time that I gave into peer pressure and decided to try out the book. Once I did I was hooked. Hogwarts became my home.

Reading this book taught me so so much at that time. Specifically that I didn't have to be alone - that even in my darkest times there was someone I could turn to. Someone cared. It didn't matter that these people were fictional. They became my best friends. I related to them. I grew up with them. I struggled and laughed and cried and experienced life with them. How did an 8 year old develop these complex emotions and philosophical realizations? Not a freaking clue. I just know I had a journal entry regarding these newly discovered truths of my life. Needless to say this series holds a very special place in my heart. Always.

Enough about me. Onto the book! Harry grew up a rather neglected child being raised by his reluctant aunt and uncle. Strange things occasionally occurred with him always be blamed for no real reason. That is until a series of unusual happenings took place around his birthday. His 11th birthday! Dun dun DUN! What's so important about turning 11 you ask? Nothing for you mere mugg... I mean mortals! But for Harry it's everything! He gets a letter informing him of his acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Come again? What??? But that's not all! A friendly giant gives him his real life story. Then whisks him away to gather supplies.
Tag along as Harry is reintroduced to the world he was born into. Learn the truth about his origins and embrace the quirky characters he meets on his journey. Delve into the world of magic and the enchanting adventures that unfold! Just keep an eye out for He-who-must-not-be-named!"
467,468,5,"Der Anfang von Harry Potter

In dem Buch Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen (Harry Potter 1) von J. K. Rowling, geht es um Harry Potter, welcher bei seiner Tante Mrs. Dursley und seinem Onkel Mr. Dursley, sowie seinem Cousin Dudley aufwachsen muss, weil seine Eltern bei einem Autounfall gestorben sind. Leider hat es Harry bei seiner Tante, Onkel und Cousin nicht gut, den er wird schlecht behandelt so ähnlich wie Aschenputtel. Erst kurz vor seinem elften Geburtstag bekommt Harry einen Brief zugeschickt, erst einen den er nicht lesen darf und dann kommen immer mehr, bis Onkel, Tante und Cousin mit ihm ans Meer fahren um dem zu entgehen, denn egal wohin sie gehen, es kommen immer Briefe für Harry an. Das reicht Mr. Dursley und sie fahren gemeinsam zu einer abgelegenen Hütte an der niemand ist. Als alle schon schlafen kommt ein sehr großer Mann zur Tür herein, der behauptet Harry sein ein Zauberer.

Meine Meinung:
Ich kannte natürlich schon den Film und wusste ungefähr was passiert, aber die Geschichte dazu zu lesen war auch nochmal sehr spannend und teilweise etwas anders als im Film. Der Schreibstil war flüssig zu lesen und die Geschichte spannend geschrieben. Ich mag es wie Harry, Ron und Hermine Freunde werden und sich mit Hagrid anfreunden, sowie wie sie die Abenteuer erleben und gemeinsam meistern.

Fazit:
Als Buch und als Film einfach toll."
468,469,5,"I grew up with Harry Potter and have read the books so many times that the bindings are falling apart but I wanted to tackle them again as an adult. No words will ever do these books justice so have simply compiled some of my favorite quotes below.

I am listening to the books this time around and though it is different it is no less magical. The narrator is perfect! If you have not experienced the magic of Harry Potter (books) then you need to!!! Both audible and written are great and I am feeling I appreciate them even more this time around.

“It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.”

“It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.”

“There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.”

“To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.”

“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. Love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves it's own mark. To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.”"
469,470,5,"Well written and entertaining

I don't think that there is anything new which I can say about one of the world's most popular fantasy novels so I will merely address one of the controversies. That is the worry which some Christians have about witches, wizards and magic in the book. I have been a Christian since childhood. I have also been reading science fiction and fantasy, including C. S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, since childhood as have many of my relatives, friends and acquaintances. Neither I nor any of those I know have ever had any trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy. Nor have any of us tried to emulate the obviously fictional antics we have read about. None of us have ever tried to fight a lion with a knife ala Tarzan nor tried to cast spells. Though unfortunately there are such people in the world. Any child or adult who can not separate reality and fantasy has more serious problems than reading Harry Potter and should be receiving professional help.

Meanwhile, enjoy this wonderful, well written and entertaining book."

Iako ga inicijalno nisam pročitala kao mala djevojčica, nego kao malo veća, pripremila sam se za onaj dio u kojem ""divovi padaju"" i u kojem se ruše neki ranije postavljeni uzori. Nema šanse da će mi danas biti toliko dobro kao nekad, zar ne? Iz iskustva znam da se to i prečesto događa, osobito sa štivima namijenjenim djeci (Hobitiću, da, tebe gledam).

Ali ne, opet sam uživala, u nekim dijelovima možda i više nego tada. Možda i zato što je danas djetinjstvo puno udaljenija uspomena nego kad sam imala 16 godina i maštala o odraslosti. Mnogo je čarolije u ovoj knjizi, i to ponajmanje one vezane uz magiju."

495,496,5,"Nereden bilsin, o anda ülke boyunca gizlice toplanıp kadeh kaldırıyordu insanlar, ""Harry Potter'a"" diyorlardı fısıltıyla, ""sağ kalan çocuğa!""


Benim Harry Potter'a olan sevgimi bilmeyen kalmadı çevremde ama ben buna rağmen hiçbir yerde Harry Potter hakkında yorum girmemiştim. Benim için Harry Potter'a yorum girmek oldukça zor çünkü ben hayatımda sadece ve sadece Harry Potter dünyası için böyle yoğun bir sevgi besledim. Ne en sevdiğim sanatçı vardır, ne en sevdiğim film. İlk ve tek yaptığım şeydir Harry Potter.






Fakat seriye tekrar başlamışken yorum girmeye karar verdim. İçimdeki sevgi müsaade ederse bir iki şey karalayacağım.

Seriyi defalarca okumuş ve delice seven biri olarak söyleyeceğim ilk şey Felsefe Taşı'nın diğer kitaplara kıyasla çocuksu bir dille yazılmış olmasıdır. Serinin diğer kitaplarında hissetmeyeceğiniz düşüncesini bu kitapta hissediyorsunuz fakat bana kalırsa bu seri sadece çocuk kitabı olarak geçemeyecek kadar uzun ve derin. 7'den 70'e her yaşın okuyabileceği bir dünya var.

Bide söylemek istediğim bir şey daha var ki o da çeviri. Bence YKY'nin çeviriye el atma zamanı geldi de geçiyor. Evet Ülkü Tamer çevirilerini seviyorum fakat çeviri o kadar eski ki insanın karşısına tuhafına giden kelimeler bile çıkıyor. Bide çeviride en rahatsız olduğum şey 'Mr. ve Mrs.' unvanlarının çevrilmemiş olması. Normalde bile çevrilmesi gerekiyor sonuçta çevirilen dil Türkçe ama hadi onu geçtim bu kitap dünya üzerinde çocuk kitabı diye ün yaptı. Ne istiyorsunuz bu çocuklardan siz, bırakın da Bay ve Bayan diye okusunlar yazık değil mi -.-

Kitapları okurken o kadar heyecanlanıyorum ki zaman zaman mutluluk gözyaşları dökerken buldum kendimi. Harry Potter okurken ağlamak benim işim adgjhasgdja

Hemen ciddileşiyorum.

Harry Potter söz konusu olduğunda en sevdiğim karakteri seçemiyorum ben, hepsi o kadar özenilerek oluşturulmuş ki hepsine ayrı ayrı hayranım.

Dediğim gibi her karakteri seviyorum, Voldemort'u bile. Ama bazılarını daha çok seviyorum. Mesela Weasley ikizleri. Mesela Ron. Bence kitabın en eğlenceli kısımlarını hep Weasley'ler oluşturuyor. Ron'un her diyalogu insanı güldürür mü, güldürüyor. Kendimi hep kıkırdarken buluyorum asjhdgja






Seride her karakterin kendine has özellikleri var ve her karakter bir şeyi simgeliyor. Dumbledore bilgeliği, Ron dostluğu, Hermione zekayı ve soğukkanlılığı, Harry cesareti, Severus fedakarlığı ... diye uzar gider bu. İnanın bana kitabı defalarca okuyunca en ufak detayı yakalıyorsunuz, her şey size daha anlamlı geliyor. Yani bence sizde defalarca okuyabilirsiniz benim gibi,

Allahım içimden buram buram sevgi fışkırdığı için yorum bile yazamıyorum ama size ufak bir bilgi de vermeden geçmek istemiyorum. Rowling bu kitap için tam olarak 12 kitabevine başvurdu ve hepsinden de red yanıtı aldı. Düşünebiliyor musunuz ? 12 kitabevinden red yedi ama pes etmedi. En sonunda Bloomsbury Yayınları kitabı basmayı kabul etti ama bir şartları vardı. Kadın bir yazarın önyargı yaratacağını düşündükleri için yazarın ilk isimlerini kısaltarak J.K.Rowling adı ile kitabı basacaklardı ve böylece Harry Potter ve Felsefe Taşı 26 Haziran 1997'de yayınlandı.

Hahah! Şimdi kafasını duvarlara sürtüyordur kitabı kabul etmeyen yayınevleri. Çünkü Harry Potter serisi bugüne kadar toplamda 520 milyon sattı. Ve bu da bence hemen pes eden yazarlara çok güzel bir örnek olmalı.

Ay yine aşka geldim. İçimdeki sevgi yorum yazmama engel oluyor arkadaşlar, üzgünüm. Hemen gidip filmini izlemem lazım."

RAEF'S RATING (age 6): 4 STARS
MEG'S RATING (age--none of your business): 5 STARS

LEAH'S REVIEW:

I liked the book and I liked the movie. It was exciting when they destroyed the troll.

LEAH'S FAVORITE QUOTE:

""Welcome!"" (Dumbledore) said. ""Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you.""


RAEF'S REVIEW:

They should have figured out the answers faster and had better questions. The part I liked was the part when they were trying to get the Sorcerer's Stone at the end. The ending was a surprise.

RAEF'S FAVORITE QUOTE:

""And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?""
""Throw it away and punch him on the nose,"" Ron suggested.

MEG'S REVIEW:

I get it! I finally get Harry Potter! I know it's not exactly rocket science, but I didn't fully understand the obsessive fascination with this series until I read the first book to my kids. They were absolutely RIVETED the entire time. Every magical enchantment was rewarded with an ""ooohhh"" and ""ahhh,"" every one of Ron's jokes met with hysterical laughter, and I could actually watch my son and daughter grow stronger with each impossible obstacle or horrific monster Harry overcame. In one early scene, Leah literally started crying when Harry thought he would be thrown out of school and sent back to the Dursley's. Now THAT is a sure sign of someone who is LIVING a book, not reading it.

So that's why my kids loved it. Here's why *I* loved it: Harry is strong. He stands up for what is right regardless of who stands against him (friend, enemy, authority figure, incorporeal undead wizard of darkness, etc.), which makes him a powerful hero for my 4- and 6-year-old. He's brave, self-sacrificing, and honorable. I think Harry proves his own character, and addresses the book's central theme itself, in a scene he shares with Malfoy near the beginning of his time at Hogwarts. In this particular scene, Malfoy gives a snotty little spiel on how he can introduce Harry to the best wizarding families and help him stay away from the ""wrong sort."" Harry then refuses to shake Malfoy's hand and responds, ""I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."" And isn't that the essence of growing up? Moving away from simply doing what others tell us to do and learning to discern right and wrong for ourselves? Then, as soon as we know what's right, we can work on growing strong enough to stand up for it regardless of who stands against us. Harry is brilliant! Almost as brilliant as his author, who's created a story that is both wonderful and wonderfully told. Bravo!

MEG'S FAVORITE QUOTES (and, of course, Dumbledore says most of them):

Scars can come in handy.

Harry wished he had about eight more eyes.

The very dust and silence seemed to tingle with some secret magic.

From that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.

It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.

One can never have enough socks.

Death is but the next great adventure.

Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.

The truth... is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.

To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin.

There are all kinds of courage. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends."
497,498,5,"This is the book that made me love reading. When I was younger I used to hate reading. I couldn't do it and I had no interest in learning it, but I could memorize. So in kindergarten reading groups that was exactly what I did. I memorized. I memorized the reading group books and passed through them all without ever learning how to read. It was my first grade teacher that figured me out and spent four weeks teaching me to read. I owe a lot to that woman. Still, I didn't really like to do it. It wasn't until second or third grade my mom brought this home and handed it to me and told me to give it a shot.

Chapter one I handed it back and said I didn't like it, she handed it back and told me to try again. Rinse and repeat for a few chapters until something amazing happened. I didn't want to give the book back. I didn't want to put it down to go eat dinner and I certainly didn't want to put it down and go to bed. I stayed up until I was falling asleep on the pages and then I took it to school and started my bad habit of reading in class. Then I read through lunch and recess and silent reading time until I finished this book.

I devoured all the others when I could get my hands on them but between Harry Potter books I didn't know what to do with myself. So my parents did a little digging around and found me another book I liked and then another and another until I became the family bookworm. I started borrowing books from my older sister, I started reading books to my younger brother, I read just about everything and anything I could find and I loved every minute of it.

It's really hard to rate a book that I grew up on, but if any book deserves five stars, it's this one because it helped turn me into the person I am. The series itself got me through a lot of hard times and I love going back to it and re-reading it because it feels like coming home."
498,499,5,"i've seen a couple of other people do this, and i love the idea: in light of jkr's horrible transphobia being unearthed yet again, it's time to promote some trans authors!!!!

primarily, i'm promoting Jordan L. Hawk, a trans man who has written literally THE BEST m/m romances i have ever read. no trans main characters in his books yet, but still an author worth reading. Widdershins is the best, but it's a bigass series (but small books) so you could always start with the wonderful, enemies-to-lovers historical paranormal .

i also adored the contemporary , a YA book about a trans girl.

and if you're more of a poetry person, there's the magnificent , and my own little thing, .

TRANS RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS!!!!!!"
499,500,5,"Reread in November 2021
Nothing new to add. Just wanted something to kind of get me out of the funk I've been feeling.

Reread in April 2020
I haven't read this series since 2016, haven't even thought about picking up a Harry Potter book in almost 4 years. Which is crazy. I decided that I wanted to reread this first book for the and so I listened to the audiobook again. And it was just a lovely experience. I think I'll continue to reread this series, maybe one a month until I'm done, just because I have so much love and nostalgia for Harry Potter. It's a comfort series that I will continue to return to probably for the rest of my life.


I know I just reread this back in December. But I decided that I want to reread the entire series this year because I just love Harry Potter so much and it's been so long since I reread the entire series. This time around, I decided to listen to the audiobook. While the narration was great, I kinda almost feel like listening to the audiobook took away a little bit of the magic of the story. I still love this book, of course. And I'd never give it anything less than 5 stars. But I'm curious to see if this audiobook opinion is actually how I feel about the audiobook or if it's just because of my over-saturation of audiobooks lately. Only time, and The Chamber of Secrets, will tell.


This is probably my fifth or sixth time reading The Sorcerer's Stone. I've been feeling a bit slumpy about my reading lately and I thought picking up this old favorite might help me out a bit. I was right! I feel ready to jump back into reading. The only question now is, do I pick up a different book or do I continue on and read The Chamber of Secrets?"
500,501,5,"Have you heard of a little series named Harry Potter? No? Well, I know it's a small series that is barely ever spoken of but I think it's worth checking out.

Okay, okay....I'm done with that BS.

I'm positive that I've reviewed this book on here before for another edition but alas, this book (and this series in general) is a classic. A classic for children. A classic for adults. Across the lifespan, it's a classic. I know it says I've only read it twice on here but I've actually read and reread this book at least eight times. That's an estimate, the reread count could actually be much higher.

There is something about this book (and the series) that makes it feel like ""home"". Having a bad day? Need an item of comfort? This book is always does the job for me. After countless rereads, you would think I would get bored of the story but that is definitely not the case.

It's hard to describe this book, especially to newcomers of the series. It is a story about a boy that finds out he's a wizard and then goes on an adventure to wizarding school but it actually is much more than that. It's a story about love, about friendship, about strength, about perseverance, about what is right and what is wrong. I could go on. This story addresses so much and even though it's a fictional story, there is wisdom that is applicable to everyday life, even as an adult.

If I could name one book that shaped me into who I am as a reader, I would say that it would be this one. Even though it's hard to choose one book, I would say this book really started my love of reading to the intensity that it is.

This book is magical and I can only hope that it gets into the hands of many more in future generations."
501,502,5,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K Rowling - 5/5 stars

I wished that I had read this book when I was younger. It really is amazing. The plot development and the characters in this book were so good! I just can't get enough of it.

In this tale of the Philosopher's Stone, Harry discover that he is a wizard. He lives with muggles and is treated rather poorly even though his muggle family know that he is a wizard.
On his eleventh birthday, Harry receives a letter from the school for wizards and witches. He eventually attends Hogwarts and meets his friends, Ron and Hermoine. The friendship between these three will definitely be one of my favorites easily, I can already tell.

I loved the entire book and breezed through it. It left my mind amazed and bewildered. I have watched the films countless of times and now I SEE THE MISSING PORTIONS that are so relevant to the plot. The book makes everything much more clear and I loved the casting of spells and the sorting hat where Harry was sorted into Gryffindor!

Will definitely be reading this series throughout this year and I can't wait. Planning to listen to the auidobooks for a new experience as well."
502,503,5,"Ich glaube nicht, dass ich noch irgendjemandem erklären muss, warum Harry Potter eine wunderbare Geschichte ist und ein ganz besonderes Buch!
Ich habe es nach über 15 Jahren noch einmal gelesen und war sofort wieder verzaubert von der Welt und den Charakteren die J.K.Rowling da geschaffen hat. Auch wenn ich die Filme sehr sehr oft gesehen habe und ich die Umsetzung wirklich top finde, ist das Buch natürlich viel intensiver oder es passiert einfach noch mehr. Ich bin sehr froh, dass ich endlich wieder mit der Reihe begonnen habe und es hat mir richtig gut getan!
Man kann Harry Potter ganz wunderbar auf englisch lesen und ich bin förmlich durch die Seiten gerauscht und habe jede Seite genossen.
Zum Glück habe ich einen Großteil der Folgebände auch schon zu Hause :)"
503,504,5,"I started Harry Potter late, and I kept telling myself better late than never. Yes, that does work to an extent. And then I think of my younger version, reading all the crap our school teachers used to give us. And then I think how much fun would have been to read Harry Potter at that age. I can’t wait to get my hands on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."
504,505,5,"I have been richly rewarded for waiting all these years to read this - what an indulgence to be able to read the new illustrated version for my first Potter book. It's brilliant! I especially love the incredibly soulful sketch of Harry on page 238.

Loved this, all of it - but no point in reviewing and remarking on what the world already knows. If you are a fan and haven't perused the Jim Kay illustrated volume yet, you really must. It's a masterpiece. I hope they do all the volumes, but I'm not waiting any longer to read the rest of them! On to #2........"
505,506,5,"Many, many years ago I set about reading this series and only made it through three of them. Recently I decided to FINALLY get my grubby paws on a set to call my own and give the series a read. This book was just as good, if not even better, this time around! Knowing I had read it before and having also seen the movie more times than I care to count didn't change how perfect it is for a series opener.

I cannot wait to tuck in to the second book! ♥"
506,507,5,"For 20 years I have been reading the books and watching the movies. I‘ve been to the exhibition and I regularly have Harry Potter evenings with my friends. And no matter how often I experience this story, it never gets less than phenomenal. Hogwarts is always there to welcome me home.

507,508,5,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone is worth the hype. It’s full of magical world-building and magic. It’s a fun and addicting read that keeps you reading from the very first page. Besides the Dursley’s and House points, everything about this book is enjoyable. I will admit that keeping my mind away from the movies was a bit hard but in the end, it was countered by the events that are different between the book and the movie. I highly recommend reading this book!"
508,509,5,"The second reread after 14 years and the first time to read it in English.
I enjoyed it more than I'd expected, I felt the joy of being back to Hogwarts and all ❤️.
The writing style is easy and understandable for those who want to improve their English language. The story is fascinating and really capturing.

I can't wait to read the reread the rest of the series again! It's been a long time!"

519,520,5,"UPDATE 1/8/2018: For our first episode in the new year, Book Geeks Uncompromised had a very similar discussion to this. We talked about what it was like reading this first book in the Harry Potter series as an adult versus our experience reading it as kids. Honestly, recording this episode was a blast and I would love to know what you all think as well. You can listen here or on iTunes or your podcatcher app. :)

Note before reading this: as long as these books have been out and as prevalent as the series is in pop culture, I am taking it as read that everyone has at least seen the movies if not read the books. So .

It has been at least 5 years, if not more, since I re-read this book. As one of the most prominent things in pop culture, especially in book culture, I really don’t think that there is anything that I can add in terms of reviewing it. I love it, of course. was my introduction into magic and fantasy. But I just don’t feel like there is anything new to be said as far as reviewing it. So I just kind of want to ramble about things that I noticed reading it now that I didn’t when I was younger. More of a blog post than an actual review.

I was a little bit worried that having aged 18 years since I read for the very first time, a lot of my fondness for the series would be based on nostalgia rather than actually still finding it an enjoyable, even magical, read. .

I cannot tell you how happy I am to realize that, for me at least, Nostalgia does of course play a part in that magic for me. This has been something that has been a part of me pretty much for over half of my life and I was a pretty hardcore fangirl once upon a time but I think even if I was just picking it up for the very first time, I would still find it to be a great book.

The thing that actually bothered me though that I never noticed before was that the demonization of a group of children. Discrimination is a huge theme in the series but I don’t think it gets called out enough Obviously Slytherins that grew up to actually be Death Eaters (aka Terrible People) deserve all the shit that they receive. But these are kids.

I know that it has been pointed out many times before that Dumbledore taking the House Cup away from Slytherins at the end of Sorcerer’s Stone was unfair. And that’s true, it is pretty bullshit. This is something that I noticed while watching the movies again a while back but it wasn’t until reading this book that I noticed a somewhat deeper problem.

Something that I have come to really appreciate in books is nuance in the shades of gray in characters. I like the complexity and depth. That’s not to say that there are not complex characters in Harry Potter. There most certainly are! But the series as a whole does take a very black and white view of things and people.

In this first book, this is taken out on children.

Everyone’s hatred of Syltherins is rooted in its being tied to dark magic and to Voldemort. But that’s not the case for everyone that is in Slytherin just as being brave and true isn’t the case for everyone in Gryffindor (i.e. Peter Pettigrew).

There are comments made in the book about it not being just Gryffindors that hate the Slytherins for winning the House Cup for so many years in a row prior to this story. Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws are bitter about it always being Slytherin that wins.

So why is it that Slytherin always won?

It is mentioned that Snape favored Slytherins but there is never any mention of any other teacher favoring them. Surely it can’t be that the favoritism of one single teacher skewed the House Cup in favor of one group for several years. If this were the case, why didn’t someone step in?

So we have to conclude that the . So everyone, including apparently the headmaster, is in on tearing these kids down as soon as Harry Potter shows up, even when the points for the House Cup show that they simply were more deserving according to Hogwarts rules.

No wonder they all hate him.

Imagine that you are a parent of one of these Slytherin kids. A victory was just taken away from your child because of another kid. Yeah, that kid did stop Voldemort from returning but Slytherin kids spent the whole year working up to their points that should have won them a victory only for it to be snatched away at the very last minute by some very reaching logic from their Headmaster.

As a parent, I’d be pissed.

Not only that, but they then get to see not just the Gryffindors who just won cheering but Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw cheering as well solely on the fact that it was not Slytherin that won.

So you have these children that because of their House, and in some cases their families, they are accused from childhood of being evil, of being lesser, or conspiring with dark magic. They themselves are discriminated against for something they really have no control over. What are the odds that when Voldemort returns, someone like Malfoy join the Death Eaters? Yes, the Golden Trio should be rewarded for preventing the return of a dark lord whose goal was little more than slaughtering people he saw as lesser. But is too much to ask to reward them in a way that doesn’t create more victims?

I thought Hermione was crazy when she comments (I believe in book 5 but I’m not certain exactly) that the concepts of Houses and, even House Quidditch teams, promotes division rather than unity.

I was too young to understand it then but she was so right! Draco Malfoy can be a bully and a snooty little brat and his character should be punished for that but the book kind of holds him and Snape as the standard for all of Slytherins and punishes them all equally when we only see a handful of them behave poorly.

Paradoxically, though there is this persecution of Slytherins, if I am not mistaken there have been studies done that show that people that read Harry Potter as kids have grown up to be people that see the harm in persecution and discrimination. I also think it is interesting that JK Rowling is one of the most liberal-minded and accepting people out there. I just don’t see her as the type of person that would judge a whole group of people based on the poor decisions of a few.

Perhaps, knowing JK Rowling for who she is (at least on social media, and I have no evidence to suggest that she is faking a stance online just for the popularity), she realized this and tried to move away from it as the series went on. As the series goes on, it moves a little away from the stark black and white view of the world and adds some nuance. Both Snape and Malfoy are given some shades of gray to their character, Voldemort is given a motive for why he is evil (as opposed to it just being evil for the sake of being evil), and the books actually begin their exploration of the harmfulness of persecution with Hermione in the second book.

This is also a reason that I love the Harry Potter fandom and got into fanfiction several years ago. So many stories were so good at exploring the characters in ways that differed from canon, sometimes drastically, or that delved into things that the books/movies only touched on.

I think this has managed to be my longest review/blog post yet so thank you to anyone that stuck it out all the way through with me. XD

But I would like to know what everyone else's thoughts are on this or regarding any other topic related to Harry Potter so tell me what you think! There is never not time for a Harry Potter discussion!"
520,521,5,"Por mais anos que passem, Harry Potter sempre será Harry Potter. É tão bom entrar de novo neste mundo. Tenho de admitir que ri muito na leitura deste livro, especialmente com os Dursleys."
521,522,5,I JUST LOVE IT SO MUCH.
522,523,5,"HP is my number one book series for a reread!
Reading Harry Potter and Philosopher's Stone is like meeting an old friend. It never gets old and I'll never get tired of reading it!

“There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.”

You can't help falling in love with reading after discovering the Harry Potter series as a young reader. This is the magical place where book worms are born!!HP turns reluctant readers into series bookworms and devourers of book series, and this is true for my eleven year old daughter.

I began reading the Harry Potter series to her two years ago and she quickly fell in love with the HP world and characters. She laughed, cried, celebrated with and cheered for HP and his friends. She can even remember the names of each of the characters in the whole series!


Reading Harry Potter has opened up a world of books for her and now she's reading book three in the and she has already finished reading series, a few YA (middle grade) paranormal books, and my YA horror book , and she loved it! I think my little bookworm is about to raid my stash of books and I better move my romance/grown up books out of the way until she's a bit older.



Once again, I finished reading but this time I read it with my nine year old son. He's a reluctant reader who loves the outdoors and computer games so I decided to use HP to improve his reading skills and perhaps help him discover love of books.



He loves watching the HP movies (only the first three) but this is the first time he has read and he tells me the book is better than the movie! I'm so proud of him! He's upset the movies left out Peeves the Poltergeist, the prankster ghost and his new favourite character. He's already quoting The Philosopher's Stone (and he's adding a few twists of his own) and it's pretty funny and adorable!



We've already started , It's going to take us a long time to finish the HP series but it'll all be worth it in the end.

Already a new generation is discovering the phenomenal, magical and beautiful series that is Harry Potter and I'm so happy to play a small part in this discovery.


, humour, incredible, imaginative and easily accessible writing skills makes reading HP is as easy as..."
523,524,5,"This is one of my all-time favorite series! I had actually first heard of the series when a friend of mine was reading the Prisoner of Azkaban and was trying to describe a dementor to me. From there I did some looking into the book to discover it was a series. The day before I flew out to visit my grandparents my dad bought me the first book to read on the flight. By the time the flight was over I had devoured the book! I have since read it several times and have yet to tire of it, and each time I read it, I take a little more with me. It never gets tiring or old. I draw a bit more insight from the characters, the places, and the minute details each time I read this.

I think just about everyone has heard about the books by now which is why I am not focusing so much on plot and characters. We've all heard about them. Instead, I want to share mostly the overall feel the book leaves you with.

The world of Harry Potter has to be one of the most engaging concepts I have ever read. Invigorating and rich. Magic and adventure lovers should not miss this book. Honestly one book I think everyone should read at least once is this. In truth, I also recommend once more minimum, after you have read the entire series. find and place and the hidden dots, clues and spoilers. It actually enriches the entire experience.

Saying you've seen the movie does not do it justice. There are so many details you'll miss this way. From how they celebrate holidays with Wizard Crackers to the fantastically annoying Peeves the Poltergeist of Hogwarts (still mad he is not in the movies). While the films are good, the book is so much more!

The story is real enough we can all relate. We've all read stories about good vs evil and this is no exception. But the originality that goes into the world building changes everything! Not to mention the imperfect heroes. Harry Potter is not some grand, perfect student. me makes mistakes, break rules, and is overall average as a student. His friends and even enemies have their own strengths and weaknesses as well.

Yet relate-able as the characters are, the magical world is one so fantastical I hate leaving it. This is one of the best 'escape' from reality books. And a great mood lifter as well.For older kids, teens and adults of all ages! People of all backgrounds can enjoy this book. So if you haven't read it, do so NOW!

2020-It's amazing the things you notice with re-reads. Like how easily muggle-raised wizards/witches like Harry and Hermoine fit into the wizarding world. Like, wasn't Hermoine and her family skeptical finding out about her? I'd love to know earlier reactions or learn about her first trick to get her supplies. Did someone help her like Hagrid helps Harry? Its such a rich world and I always want to go further into it! And Draco- I forgot nearly forgot how immature he was! But how they explained Harry's broom and Draco's part in it was priceless!

2023- Extra focus was give to Snape's scenes this time. My visual image of the potions lab sure changed this time! I found it interesting that Harry was able to have access to and was reading his school books all August long (potentially), yet he still seemed clueless. Did the books not make sense from a more ""muggle"" standpoint, I wonder? Also small other small inconsistencies to the later books. While I still love these books, the more I read them, the more things I find where I see JK nearly scrambling to come up with a plausible answer. Guess when you reach a level of fandom, you also get critiqued more, especially as we continue to evaluate again and again. Still I love it!"

What!!! 0,5 star less than before? Yes.. Although this is my favourite series of all time, I want to be objective.

I think this was my seventh or eighth reread, but now I really am reading it with adult eyes, instead of in the atmosphere of nostalgia. I was a bit afraid I would like it less, but I was wrong. This first book is written more like a children’s book than I remembered and the pace is very quick for a fantasy series. It really is very fast-paced.
But the quality is still exquisite. It’s so funny and witty. Rowling makes jokes while not explaining why it’s funny and just shows the reader how dumb the Dursley’s are. Things I read past the first times around (I think), like how Vernon is doing increasingly mindless and crazy stuff, which is written matter-of-factly. Very clever and I can see why children would like that, cause the child in me likes it too.



Rowling can capture a persons essence in a single sentence. It’s good to know the characters flesh out in the end of this series, otherwise it would be too two-dimensional. This part is still a children’s book, so it’s actually perfect. Also, I really like that the protagonist isn’t a ‘chosen one’ without any flaws. Hermione basically saves everybody from their deaths. They would be nowhere without her.

Though, one thing that really bothered me is the sheer arrogance of our favourite trio when trying to
But well, it fits their age to think they are smarter and better informed than their elders. So this annoyance is forgiven because I’m not the intended audience anymore with my 31 years.


Furthermore, Dumbledore is my favourite old and wise character of all time. Here are some of my favourite quotes from this book:"
525,526,5,"As many know, illustrated editions have been released for the first two Harry Potter books and yes, this little Potterhead right here had to have them. ;P
However, when looking them up online, I came across the deluxe editions with the fold-out maps of the different sides to Diagon Alley and although the price was pretty high, I couldn't resist. After all, there's only one being published every year so it's affordable right? *is hearing her bank account cry in the background*

Anyway, it was definitely worth its money! The book comes in a linen slipcase with the Golden Snitch printed on, with the book itself being covered in the same linen as well but having the outline of Diagon Alley printed on the cover (front and back).

The story, of course, is the same as it has always been: abused Harry finding out that - thank goodness! - he will not have to live with the Dursleys until he comes of age and lead a miserably grey existance because he's a wizard! Wouldn't we all risk death by three-headed dog or Dark Wizard for that?!

What makes this book shine are the illustrations by Jim Kay! So here are some examples:






Although some of the illustrations (namely of the people in the story) don't always show the characters as I had pictured them for myself (Maggie Smith will always be the perfect McGonagall), I loved the artwork. The colours used, the quirky little details in the bigger spreads ... Kay gets the humour between the lines and the otherness of the magical world. By the way: the map of Diagon Alley I mentioned is so big when folded out that I couldn't take a good picture of it! But it's so detailed and that I fell in love with it right away!

P.S.: For anyone needing proof that McGonagall / Maggie Smith is bad-ass:"
526,527,5,"What can I say about a book I have read dozens of times that has a bazillion reviews on here already?

Well, I can say that for some odd reason, I realized after my most recent re-read that I accidentally rated this 4 stars at some point. What?!?! If a book I want to keep reading over and over again doesn't deserve 5 stars, I don't know what does.

Is Harry Potter a classic? Many literary critics wonder if ""extremely popular"" translates into ""instant classic"". No, it doesn't. Many of the top selling books or series over the past decade or so are, quite frankly, horribly written. They are popular for a minute, get turned into movies, make tons of money, and then poof. People aren't still purchasing those books by the millions. In fact, I got an email from my favorite secondhand book store the other day asking everyone to please stop bringing in copies of 50 Shades and Twilight. They have too many and can't even sell them secondhand.

But you know what they don't have?
That's right.

Nobody gets rid of their Harry Potter books. In fact, I have several different editions in my home. So does my sister. And my other sister. And my mom. And my best friend. And my ex-boyfriend. And... well, you get the picture. This is the book that started it all, and it is a classic already.

Yes, I am in my 40s AND I DON'T CARE. I am a Harry Potter fan. I might even be a fanatic. I know my house, my wand, my patronus, the back stories of all the characters, the futures of all the characters, and I never ever miss a trivia question on this subject.

Reading it over and over again, one finds all those little nuggets that are well-hidden but are important later. One sees how truly masterful Rowling was in creating this other world that we all want to go to. One sees that book Ron was given the shaft in the movies. One sees that book Hermione has flaws that are important.

One even sees that this story isn't about witchcraft or wizardry. It's about friendship and bravery, loyalty and courage, teamwork and kindness. It's about how the person who reads knows the stuff. Most importantly, it's about doing the right thing when it's really fucking hard to do that.

I can't think of better things to teach my son. He's a Potterhead, too, and I couldn't be prouder."

Reseña de primera lectura:
Oh shit !! Porfin comencé esta saga, era hora !! Pensé que esta lectura no me iba a sorprender tanto y a gustar tanto ya que había visto la película, pero todo lo contrario. A medida que iba leyendo el libro parecía que no había visto al película. El hecho de que hace un montón que no la veía de nuevo ayudo un montón también. Ademas de que obviamente un montón de escenas no están en la película, o le cambiaron cosas pequeñas (porque las películas de hp son bastante fieles, i think).
En cuanto a personajes, Harry es uno que a pesar que no haya amado, me encanta esa personalidad de todo a la mierda, yo lo hago igual. Y pensar que es super chico igual ajaja. Hermione es bastante infumable a veces, pero se nota que como amiga es excelente, amo sus ironías y su sentido del humor, me encanta !! Ron es otro personaje que me gusta muchísimo, es como un gran amigo fiel. Hagrid es como un padre con mentalidad de niño ajajaj, me encanta, su personalidad, su sentido del humor, sus bromas, lo fiel que es, etc. Draco es el típico niño malvado, que de vez en cuando se manda de las suyas, pero al final de todo, termina perdiendo!! Toma Draco, por gilipollas.

Le di 5 estrellas porque en este libro se introduce todo lo que es el mundo mágico de Hogwarts y de todo este mundo. Es increíble la imaginación de esta mujer! Cada cosa que hay en este mundo es increíble (a no ser los muggles, los muggles son mierda). Me sorprendí MUCHO en el final, porque sinceramente yo creía
.

La parte final, en la que Ron, Hermione y Harry van en busca de la piedra filosofal, es super intensa y emocionante. Voldemort, hate u.
En fin, imposible no amar esta perfección de libro, espero seguir con el resto pronto !!"
528,529,5,"The truth."" Dumbledore sighed. ""It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.


I read this book for the first time when my parents got it for me for Christmas when I was six. Now, little six-year-old me didn't fully appreciate it, and I didn't like it after my mom read me the first two chapters. But she made me keep reading, and I'm not kidding when I say this book changed my life. It was the book that got me into reading, the book that kindled my love for fantasy. It set me down this track of wanting to be an author and trying to be a hardcore reviewer here on Goodreads.



But no matter how badly I may want to be a hardcore reviewer, there is no way for me to sum up my feelings about this book, let alone this series, and put it into a review. It's beyond what feeble paragraphs I can try to conjure up on this page, beyond what I'll be able to come up with even if I sit here all night thinking about it. Harry Potter defined its genre and has become the most well-known series published in the past three decades. I seriously doubt that there is one person who interacts with the world who hasn't at least heard of Harry Potter.



I've read this book so many times, I know it by heart. But that doesn't stop me from re-reading it during the summer every year or two, even though it's technically a middle-grade book because it's one of those books that are absolutely timeless. You can read it when you're just a little kid, you can read it when you're an adult, it doesn't matter. The magic of Harry Potter is easy to spread and absolutely effortless to enjoy.



Would I recommend this book?
I'd recommend it to everyone and if I could only choose one book to recommend ever, I'd be this.

A re-read for me and I enjoyed it just as much as when I was a kid!

You can tell this book is an introduction full of character descriptions and magical moments. This book only took me two days to get through which is a lot faster than the first time I read this!

Reading this after seeing these films does make me imagine the actors instead of using my own imagination and there are a few things that are slightly different. This book has the perfect amount of humour to I LOVE Ron so much more in the books than the films which is hard! Plus Neville plays a much bigger part in the books which I wish would’ve happened in the films!

The introduction of Quidditch and the Sorting Hat were my favourite parts of this book other than Ron’s remarks!

These books started my love of ‘big books’ I always liked to read short stories like Goosebumps but then I read the first Harry Potter when I was 10yrs and it really kicked off my love of reading.

Giving that the first film came out in 2001 and I was 5 I was a little bit behind – I wish I was 10/11 when the first book came out!

I feel like Dumbledore’s silliness is dialed down!

""Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!""

""Strange how short-sighted being invisible can make you.""

""Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.""

I have read all the books ONLY ONCE! But I have watched the films a countless amount of time! I think it was long overdue for me to re-read these but for some reason I couldn’t bring myself to read these in case I was disappointed – but I wasn’t AT ALL!

Reading this book really takes me back – it might not be the best written book in the world but the imagination and joy it brings is unlike any other!

I will be moving on the Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets at some point – and I am hoping to have re-read them all by 2021!"
530,531,5,"Sixteen years ago, I was introduced to the world of Harry Potter by my youngest brother (he was 9 years old, I was 15) and I fell so hard for Harry Potter and the magical world of Hogwarts! I watched those movies hundred of times, but I must confess that the first book I read in the series was The Half Blood Prince. I wanted to know what will happen so badly.



I was one of the people who woke up around midnight, stood in a line, and got a copy of the last book on 02:07 in 2007! Harry Potter is a huge part of my teenage years, and it's a bound between me and my brother. I remember us having discussions about what might happen and imagine we would get a letter and go to Hogwarts.



Reading the illustrated copy of this book made me feel like I was introduced to the Harry Potter world for the first time. Hermione Granger is the star of the first book! She made me laugh so hard! I can't wait to have kids and read them these books!"
531,532,5,"The only thing I can add about this book now is its writing. I read it when I was 15yo, and I read it like a maniac. I read it again when I was 22yo, just to check, if I was over-hyped about it because I was a child (as some of my friends were saying).

Nope, it seemed, I was still a child at 22, considering I enjoyed it even then. Now my friends say I didn't have a job or a busy schedule when I was 22. If I did, I wouldn't have been overhyped about it. So, I read it once again, recently, being almost 30; part of it was to study the writing ... you know, the character-building and world-building stuff.

I know my friends will again say 'Oh, now writing and reading is your job, of course, you'll enjoy it.' But I must say exactly for this very reason, now that I don't just read, but reading is my job and studying writing is the base of my job, I can tell even with more emphasis, that books published before 2000s were simply amazing in their editing, in their character building and world-building and overall writing and crafting. Those books followed the structure that worked and it still works on the readers. Considering, even though I read this one several times before, I didn't feel annoyed at the writing."
532,533,5,"No se cuántas veces he leído esta novela a lo largo de mi vida y, lo que es más importante, cuántas veces lo leeré en el futuro. Es la saga de mi vida, una de las primeras que leí y devoré y ansiaba conseguir el siguiente libro cuando había que esperar por las siguientes publicaciones. He leído este libro de niña, de adolescente y de adulta y sigue maravillándome. Leer esta novela en su edición ilustrada fue el año pasado una experiencia nueva y fascinante pero que quizá en esta nueva relectura he disfrutado más. Estás ediciones son una obra de arte y acompaña cada ilustración a la perfección toda la historia. Me encantan los valores que tiene este libro: la amistad, el valor, la lucha y la valentía. Es impensable que este libro haya sido prohibido en tantos países cuando tienen tantos valores y enseñanzas para los niños... Los que no hayáis leído la novela y solo hayáis visto las películas, os recomiendo que leáis los libros. Completarán el mundo que conocéis de Harry Potter, hay muchas escenas y hechos diferentes y muchos de ellos, esenciales en alguno de los personajes, ni siquiera fueron mostrados en las películas."
533,534,5,"Rilettura.
Ogni volta è come ritrovare dei vecchi e cari amici che non vedi da molti anni, ma ogni volta che li rivedi è come se non li avessi mai lasciati e sul viso ti affiora subito un sorriso.
Hogwarts ormai è la mia seconda casa.
Lessi per la prima volta ""La pietra filosofale"" quando ero una bimbetta che andava ancora alle medie, il libro me lo consigliò la mia dolce amata bibliotecaria delle medie, chissà che fine avrà fatto: era un libro appena uscito, quasi nessuno lo conosceva, ma me ne innamorai subito perché mentre lo leggevo, la sera prima di andare a letto, mi portava in posti favolosi e la mia mente cavalca libera su quelle pagine. Mai e poi mai avrei pensato che la stessa sensazione l'avrebbero provata altri migliaia e migliaia di persone e che il magico mondo costruito dalla Rowling avrebbe fatto sognare e appassionare così tanti uomini, donne e bambini.
La trama è inutile che la riassuma, la conoscete tutti, ma ho voluto rendervi partecipi delle sensazioni che ho provato.
È stato così bello ritrovare Hermione, Severus Piton, Minerva McGranitt e Albus Silente che nelle ultime pagine ho versato anche qualche lacrima. 💙🤗"
534,535,5,"You guys... I've finally read it! I finally started reading Harry Potter! I'm not ashamed to be honest, cause I know there are lots of people who still haven't read these books. But oh my god, why have I waited this long?! It was perfection upon perfection. J.K Rowling's writing style flows and captivates readers by first site. In addition, her writing style is easy to read and creates perfect scenery's in your head. The first book in the Harry Potter series proves that fantasy books doesn't have to be long and and stretch out every single detail till the last book. The characters she created all have their own unique personality, and I love when a novel does that. Furthermore, I loved how we got to see the many places that hogwarts had to offer, and believe me guys, you never get to see this in a fantasy book until you get to at least the third book in a series. Overall this book was pure perfection and I would recommend everyone one to read it, no matter how old you are. BEST CHRISTMAS READ EVER!"
535,536,5,"“You're a wizard, Harry.”

It‘s been more than 10 years since I read Harry Potter and the Philosopher‘s Stone for the first time.
This is my first re-read (well, I was listening an audiobook) after all these years and I am so happy that I finally found the courage to read it again. I loved this book as a child and I was worrying that I will not love it so much as an adult but I was wrong.

:
+ When Harry found out that .
+ The reality of magic world.


+ When the hat shouted out:

Bonus points for the audiobook narrator for his enthusiastic sport commentary."
536,537,5,"Update:

Rereading for the third time: but this time it’s special. My 6 year old is a walking talking HP encyclopedia. I read to her every night, and thought why not start the HP series.

It’s literally the best part of my evening. We cozy up and get right into it. She stops me every few minutes to give me a lesson on my British vernacular. I’ve gotten quite well at Hagrid.

The entire story feels like our special world. My imagination, my daughters—like magic. These moments will last with us forever.

Harry Potter Magic
5/5 stars


I never reviewed this amazing book because goodreads wasn’t on my radar 10 years ago. After reading it again, I must say Rowling’s got it right. Books of the same
genre seem to miss the mark—confusing with too many protagonists and shifting plots. This is one read that never bores."
537,538,5,"About once every other year, I re-read a book from the Harry Potter series, and it really is like coming home each and every time. The first entry to a series is extremely important as it's the one which establishes the world, the characters, and the tone, with the quality determining whether or not people will stay for the followup. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone does all of the above right and is an absolutely smashing start to one of the most influential franchises ever. Amazing characters, wonderful one-liners, a solid plot, it really is an iconic series that I'm always happy to re-visit."
538,539,5,"Going through my first global pandemic seemed like a good time for some comfort reading. So, I decided to reread Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. I definitely made the right choice. After many, MANY, years I barely remembered anything from my first read and when I finished, I had to rewatch the movie of course!

What can I say about the Harry Potter series that hasn’t been said already. I won’t even try. I had so much fun going back to the beginning where it all started. It was easy to fall into this world Rowling has created. This was the perfect escape for me at the right time. This magical masterpiece of a series will remain a timeless treasure for me."

Sigo siendo Hufflepuff y sigo teniéndole manía a Slytherin, y nunca cambiaré de opinión; ni me van a llegar a caer bien nunca los Malfoy, ni Snape. Yo soy de Harry, los Weasleys, Hermione, Dumbledore y por supuesto de McGonagall."

 "
555,556,5,"¡Pues mira tú por dónde que me ha sorprendido gratamente! 4.5 estrellas que subo a 5 por el buen sabor de boca que me ha dejado.

Con tantísimo boom como tuvo esta novela y con tanta gente recomendándola, sólo podía acabar o con un 5 estrellas o con algo bastante pobre. En este caso ha sido para bien, aunque sé que me hubiese gustado mucho más de haberla leído en su día, cuando fue publicada, pues me hubiese pillado con mucho menos bagaje sobre los hombros y con la mente más despejada. Pero, incluso así, está claro que es una novela o saga que hay que leer.

Dar detalles aquí de la trama a día doy, después de 25 años desde que fue publicada, sería meter letras por meterlas. Así que, yendo al grano, dejo por aquí lo que más me ha gustado y lo que no.

Me ha encantado el ritmo ágil y desenfadado de la novela (lógico, siendo para el público juvenil), pero lo digo en el sentido de que va al grano; con poco o casi nada que no aporte algo al desenlace final de la misma.

Los personajes, hasta los secundarios, son empáticos desde el principio, lo que ayuda a querer seguir sabiendo de ellos. También son auténticos y diferenciados, lo que hace que no sea simplemente un nombre más por rellenar.

El desenlace y los distintos puntos intermedios de la trama son muy interesantes, con algunos giros de guion que se agradecen enormemente por el disfrute de que te pille a contrapié cuando tenías una idea que considerabas clara.

Si le he quitado esa media estrella ha sido porque he reconocido detalles en ella que me recordaban mucho a obras escrita con anterioridad a este libro. Como por ejemplo, Quien-Tú-Sabes..., que me ha recordado enormemente a Sauron (salvando las diferencias).

Seguiré con la saga a no mucho tardar, que estos libros se leen muy bien incluso para los que no tenemos apenas tiempo."
556,557,5,"¡AMO LA HISTORIA DE HARRY POTTER! Es mi adolescencia💙
El 1er libro es el que he releído mas veces, pero solo sé que fueron más de 4.
Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal es una historia de fantasía bien middle grade, la edad de los protagonistas es 11/12 años así que es una historia a mi parecer muy apta para pequeños especialmente, pero también para todas las edades si uno es amante de las historias con magia.
Harry, Ron y Hermione son el trío protagonista, su amistad surge aquí y empieza su evolución, la misma marca una de las amistades más reconocidas en la literatura, a mi parecer.
Si les gusta un mínimo la magia o la fantasía hagan el favor de leer esta saga, y si no, prueben aunque sea un chiquito de este🙏🏼"
557,558,5,"I finished 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' by J. K. Rowling with a tear threatening to spill out despite that I knew how the story would end.

*sniffle*

As everyone knows - everyone - this is a very good bildungsroman story hiding under the guise of a middle-schoolers fantasy novel. I highly recommend it to everyone (as if there's a single soul on Earth who hasn't read it or seen the movie).

If you really love the Harry Potter series, I suggest . It has even more wonderful fantasy adventures of the imagination for the young and young at heart. (Or maybe just the, maybe demented, elderly like myself - shut up)




Below is a personal opinion about Rowling's recent statements on current events, specifically bathroom access for transgender women:"
558,559,5,"I feel like everyone has a Harry Potter story, and yes, I am going to bore you with mine.

The first Harry Potter book I got was not The Sorcerer’s Stone, not even The Chamber of Secrets. The first book I got was The Goblet of Fire for my birthday from my dad.

I hated it.

Not the book, but I got the book before I loved books. Mom gave it to me in the car and I remember being so upset that I was given a stupid book for my birthday. Mom said “He really thinks you’ll like it. It’s supposed to be good.”

I read the first chapter, didn’t understand anything, and then put the book down.

It wasn’t until later that I actually decided to read the books. I was sitting on my couch and a commercial came on for Harry Potter school supplies. Yup. I decided to read a book because of a commercial. I then proceeded to find out that I had the fourth book and not the first.

My dad went out with me that same weekend day to buy me the first and second. We couldn’t find the third.

I read the first two in one day. Dad found me the third by the next weekend, and I had finished all four in two weeks, getting trouble in school for reading during class. I had to wait for the fifth to be published, and proceeded to reread the books like no one’s business.

My copy of is broken in the spine in two spots, mold on the first page from when my sister spilled something on it, and I have no idea where the dust cover is. I love that copy of that book more than anything else in the world.

I love it because I had a head injury at the age of 14, after all this had happened. After I fell in love with Harry Potter. Because of that head injury, I can’t remember much of me before the age of 14. It’s lead to quite a bit of problem and some existential shit that I won’t get into today.

Even with that head injury, I can clearly remember my mom apologizing for my dad’s gift in the car. I can remember my dad’s face light up when I asked to go get the first two books, after I was such a brat for him getting me the fourth. I can remember sitting beneath my Aladdin comforter, flashlight in hand, reading and being terrified of something petrifying me. I remember dragging my sister, who knew nothing of Harry Potter, to pretend that we had magical classes together. We have the binders to prove it.

That’s why Harry Potter means so much to me. It’s the bridge between the two different Marys. I may not remember our trip to Disneyland at all, but I remember everything about discovering this series.

So I can’t read this series like a normal person, an unbiased person, because to me this series is my childhood and it comes with all the rosy-hued glasses that remembering childhood comes with."
559,560,5,"Joanne Rowling dreamed up such a relatable, compassionate, inspiring fictional universe that everyone remembers when they heard of her phenomenon. A recent highschool graduate in 1997, I heard of Harry after he traversed to North America for the first, 2001 film. Publicity blared on talk shows. I believe we saw “Harry Potter And The Philosopher’s Stone” in cheap theatres but only that time. Instant fans, we watched every film upon its release thereafter. The tinkling introductory music thrills me. Ron & I even got to watch one film with friends, in an England theatre!

The last film played in 2011 and I sought the novels second-hand. I got and eventually the classic beginning but did not want to dig in until I had more on hand. Two weeks ago, my childhood friend gave them to me! It is July 2023 and I am 50, doing what most of the reading world wishes they could do. I am reading Harry Potter for the first time! It is time to experience this story on paper where it began.

My journey easily got five stars, with surprise that the film matches what is written exactly. I was refreshed on scenes I saw years ago and dialogue I knew by heart. It was nice to picture the actors’ faces and voices. I relished the rare appearance of independent details.

narration is straightforward, which I like. Profundity comes from the most original, unusual realm with complex histories and resolutions. The moving portraiture was a marvel to me by itself; boundless imagination aglow in any format. Mystery, clue-solving, ghosts, magic, coming to terms with loss; stories like this are inspiring in one way or another for everyone. Everyone’s skill plays a part, like herbology and chess. The sleuthing sequel is my favourite."
560,561,5,"My Great Christmas Harry Potter Re-Read—Book One: Every child’s dream, escaping your humdrum life to discover you’re actually an amazing magical person and you get whisked away from where you hate being to enter this magical world of wonder. You find your “family”, you find where you belong, you find your true self, and turns out you’re more special than you ever thought possible. It is, in fact, still my dream. At 34, I still hope that every Birthday I will get my letter from Hogwarts and it’s actually just for adults. Wishful thinking, but keep hope alive. The idea of being “saved” from your own mundane life and trading it in for a magical, adventurous and amazing one, is always appealing. The idea of leaving where you clearly do not belong and finding where you clearly do belong and are accepted, is always appealing. It was when I first read it at age 10, to now for the 20th time reading it at age 34.

I always forget about Peeves because he is not in the movies, but I enjoy that irritable ball of mischief. I still picture things a little bit differently in my mind than the movies when reading them, because it’s mine from childhood, from before the movies came out. I also forget how easy it is to fly through this book as an adult, because I still think of it from my childhood perspective in my head. As an adult, it’s a super fast read. It’s written on a level where kids Harry’s age (11) can grasp everything, but the story and aforementioned appeal is good for adults too. I absolutely love this wizarding world and I love being taken away to it— I always will. More than anything, I just want it to be real and be a part of it. My heart is bursting at the seams reading this series again, it just has such a special place in my life, woven into the fabric of my being. I’m so happy I decided to read through them again. Book two, here we come!"

Like most people in the reading community, Harry Potter is my all time favourite series. Partly for the magic, partly for the characters, partly for the nostalgia. So how excited was I when I found out NEW BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATED EDITIONS ARE BEING RELEASED EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS?



(And that’s an understatement)

Rereading this series is always one of my favourite things to do, but reading it with new additional drawings was just incredible. I can’t get over the art. The detail in every single drawing was unbelievable, and I spent ages just staring and drinking in every small bit of it.

I loved how the art varied too. Sometimes there would be simple backgrounds with ink splotches dotted around so make it look like parchment. Sometimes small diagrams would be between the text to back up a description. And then there were full page drawings, some of them being double page spreads. There was even some small added snippets through these drawings, diagrams taken from the books they studied. The art really did just add to the magic of the story.

The actual story was just as amazing as ever. No matter how many times I reread this story, I’ll never get bored of it. Since this is the first book in the series there’s plenty of world building involved, now enhanced through the art too. The adventures are fun and fast paced, and the characters just as lovable as ever.

I know that this book will be a prized possession of mine. I’ll still be flicking through the pages in many years to come!"
562,563,5,"Díganme porque había pensado que nunca iba a leer los libros de Harry Potter. Bueno, eso era lo que yo había pensado. Llevaba un buen tiempo negandome a leerlos porque no me llamaban mucho la atención. Sin embargo, este es mi mes de audiolibros y cuando entré a Storytel lo primero que vi es que tenían todos los libros de Harry en audiobooks y pues escuche los primeros capítulos y no pude dejarlo.

Que historia de lo más bonita, de lo más fascinate. Esta historia es pura magia. Ame todo. Se puede decir que ya soy súper fan y ahora solo espero que llegue mi carta de Hogwarts. Por cierto, ya averigüe y soy Gryffindor.

Cada uno de los escenarios eran tan bien descritos que mi imaginación volaba. Aparte la persona que narra el audiolibro lo hace de maravilla que siento que estoy presenciando ese momento. Mejor dicho, este mundo es tan maravilloso que me sacó del mundo real. Los personajes me encantan. Ame a Hagrid (me recordó un poco a Tyson de percy). Se me hacía súper tierno y también me hacía reír. Harry y Ron me han encantado desde que se conocieron en el tren. Amo sus ocurrencias, sus diálogos, su amistad todo. Mi personaje fav definitivamente fue Hermione, me hizo recordar a mi yo de once años. Así de intensa y ñoña era yo jajajajaj. La ame demasiado y se me hizo súper bonito que hallará también a su familia en Hogwarts.

No me aguante y ya empecé el segundo. Continuaré en este mundo donde la magia está en cada una de sus páginas."
563,564,5,"Es un libro y una saga que, a través de su relectura, te das cuenta que no es un libro de cinco estrellas porque contiene muchos plot holes y hay cosas que se generan o solucionan así, de la nada... pero van las cinco estrellas porque me encanta la historia y por la nostalgia.

Esta edición es muy bella, tiene información que, si bien une ya conoce, es re lindo tenerla también en la página. Y ni hablar de los colores de tu Casa en la biblioteca. Recomendada la edición de tu Casa si querés tener alguna de la saga.

DICHO ESTO: Rowling es una transodiante y el odio, y peor, el odio a una comunidad cuyos derechos se ven vulnerados todo el tiempo frente a un discurso violento y marginalizador, es más que condenable y repudiable. Tiene las herramientas para educarse, acercarse a personas trans para conocer sus realidades y las graves consecuencias de discursos denigrantes e hirientes como el de ella, y decide, a conciencia, desaprovecharlas. Harry Potter ocupa un lugar muy importante en mi vida y en la de muches, y por eso es el único producto de ella que aun consumo. Pero que la nostalgia y el amor por esta saga no nos tape el discurso horrendo de su autora, aquel que, a través de la saga, nos enseñó a enfrentar.

Trans rights are human rights, y eso es más importante que ser fan de una autora. Que no se nos olvide"
564,565,5,"A Harry Potter, il bambino che è sopravvissuto!

Ennesima rilettura (ma la prima che segno qui su aNobii) del primo libro della saga del Maghetto.
Scoperto e divorato in tempi non sospetti, ha fatto sì che io aspettassi con ansia ogni nuova uscita, e la pubblicazione de I doni della morte è stata per me una specie di lutto!

Questo è il primo volume della saga, e si vede. Poco spazio viene dato alla lotta contro il male (ovvero Tu-Sai-Chi/Voldemort) mentre molto spazio è dedicato ovviamente alla creazione di un nuovo mondo e dei suoi personaggi. Le parti più avvincenti sono senza dubbio quelle che vedono i nostri amici impegnati nelle classiche attività di Hogwarts! Ammettiamolo, chi non ha mai immaginato di camminare lungo quegli imprevedibili corridoi prendendo parte - magari anche solo come spettatori - alle magnifiche avventure del nostro trio? Un punto in più al capitolo in cui nasce l'amicizia tra Harry e Ron da una parte e Hermione dall'altra, e anche a quello in cui Harry scopre lo Specchio delle Brame.

Sperando vivamente che l'autrice decida di continuare a scrivere e pubblicare (a questo punto, qualsiasi tipo di romanzo) tengo vivo l'ardore per HP alternando libri e film!"
565,566,5,"“Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”

Harry Potter has always been my favourite book series. Not only because they're great books, but because of the amazing world that exists outside of those books. Decades later, we still have discussions about so many points in the hp universe, about the events that happened before Harry was even born, it's a whole universe we are a part of and I'm delighted to be part of those Potterheads who introduce themselves by their Hogwarts House right after their name and age.

I don't have to repeat again and again how amazing this first book is and everyone knows its plot now, right? So I'll just make a comment on something I thought about since a while now, about the Sorting ceremony scene. It's really no wonder many Slytherin students turn to Dark magic. Imagine being eleven, both excited and anxious when you start school, the Sorting Hat put you in Slytherin and immediately almost everyone in the three others Houses think you're evil or gonna turn evil and you will be ostracized by everyone except in your House. Duh."
566,567,5,"Finally, I start reading Harry Potter books. I've been reading/reviewing since 2017 before that I never pick up a novel, but I was always into movies. I watch Harry Potter movies a lot. Like a lot. I never get bored, and always think to read the book once in my lifetime. Here I am done reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

I don't think you need me to tell you that it is a fantasy book or about the characters because if you're reading this article, then you knew about it already. first book that sold millions of copies like other volumes, but as they say books are much better than movies. I agreed. There are so many facts that Warner Bros. didn't reveal in the movie, and those facts make me feel like, ohh so, this is what actually occurred."

568,569,5,"Reread #1 - The mister and I are doing a buddy read, which is...great fun

I read the Potter books just about as they were coming out, and I have a better memory of the movies. It's definitely time for a reread

There is no point in reviewing HP but some of my main observations were:

-I liked how they mentioned Harry playing muggle sports and having a not terribly square school life
-Dumbledore is a little nuts
-I forgot that Hermione wasn't exactly supposed to be attractive
-I also forgot that Luna wasn't in book one
-The writing was a lot more middle grade than I remembered - but I think the books mature in writing, action, and length with the storyline like she knew kids would be growing up with the books
-It was also observed that honestly the Dursley's were probably better parents to Harry than to Dudley, I mean he is disgusting

I think Norbert was my favorite plot line.

I love being back in this world, it's so...comforting right now"

I had so many pages within this that I adored, the colour palette is beautiful and has such a great vibe, and the style is free, flowing and fabulous.

I always have a new appreciation of it, especially when I watch the movie right after. I love Harry’s sass and Ron’s sarcasm. I also love how Hermione grounds them both and sets them on task. The movie is great, but the book has such memorable scenes that were left out of the movie, especially towards the end when Harry, Ron, and Hermione get past all the spells set up by the professors that guard the sorcerer’s stone."

Let’s get personal...

I still remember the way my journey with started very clearly.
My brother, who’s five years older than me and literally grew up alongside Harry, and my father were always raving about and I wanted to be a part of that joy so I listened when my father read us the first book and I came into the cinema with them when the first couple of movies came out.
But the year my love for this incredible world literally imploded within me was the year I lost most of my friends due to bullying. It was the summer holiday from year seven to year eight (2009) and I was finally ready for all seven books to enchant me.
I spent all six weeks in our garden with my head buried in those books, in the shadow beneath our apple tree. I let myself be swept away into the world that would be my safe space from that day on.
I became completely obsessed, read hundreds of fanfiction stories, wouldn’t talk about anything else for years, spent my time in my imagination with Harry, Ron and Hermione.
Whenever I had a tough time I came back to these books. I fall asleep to the audiobooks or the soundtrack. I watch the movies when I feel lonely. Now, after countless rereadings in german and a 2 year (?) break from the books so I could start fresh again, I’ve finally picked up the English/original version and I’m again overwhelmed by this story so obviously crafted by love. Reading this in another language is like discovering it all for the first time again and apparently reading and crying at the same time isn’t really working but I just can’t stop.
Not to be dramatic or anything (I am but well, can’t help it) but and whatever’s going on with J.K Rowling (going a bit mad, I see; posting all kinds of problematic things) I’ll forever be grateful that she allowed us all to be part of this crazy, brilliant journey that is . No story ever meant that much to me.







The writing or the story itself is by no means perfect and there are books out there with way more beautiful prose but I couldn’t give a lesser damn because this series is everything to me. There are problematic parts, no doubt, and I acknowledge them, I actually do care a lot about all of them but this has been more than just a book to me. It’s my comfort zone, my safe space and the thing that kept me sane in my darkest of times. I can’t and will not erase this.



I’ve created a playlist for all the stunning Harry Potter videos out there that I watch whenever I feel homesick ‘cause Harry Potter really is home for me.



Thought I’d share it on here; someone might wanna have a good cry over our Golden Trio (and Draco Malfoy because duh)."
602,603,5,"I was expecting my return trip to Hogwarts to be something of a dampener. I had finished the series and after all, how many more surprises could the first book reveal? The magic must have faded over time and the characters must surely have achieved the status of house-guests who had overstayed their welcome.

Predictably enough, I was wrong.

Returning to the first book in what I can now proudly say is my most favourite series was nothing short of magical. It was enchanting to see how the complex and multifaceted characters of the later books started off as nervous, unsure .

It was a time for firsts:

a) Ill-treated, neglected 11-year old orphan discovers that he is a wizard - an actual, honest-to-goodness, wand-swishing wizard.
b) There is a magical school called Hogwarts for young witches and wizards like him and at Hogwarts, Harry Potter is a legend and so much more than a small boy who lives in a cupboard under the stairs.
b) He discovers that he had brave parents who loved him dearly and lost their lives to the most powerful dark wizard in existence in a misguided attempt to save their tiny son.
c) It will be the first time that he will meet his soon-to-be best friends and , not knowing that it would be the start of many unforeseen and memorable adventures for the trio.

For me, the charm lay in reacquainting myself with my favourite cast of characters: the great and twinkly-eyed Headmaster , stern with a staunchly hidden soft-center, quivering who is brave enough to stand up to his friends, nasty , lovable , the irrepressible and and of course, delightfully detestable .

I also liked the fact that carved out a story that was a blend of fantasy and realism. She refused to patronize her young readers. She spoke about death in a manner that doesn't usually finds it's way into a children's book. With minimal sugar-coating, she created a world that was rife with pain, loss and love.

In this book, Harry Potter faces his vile enemy for the very first time with nerve and bravery. He gets his first opportunity to prove that he is more than just a legendary kid with a mysterious past.

The book sets an adequate pace, lays the foundation for future awesomeness and needless to say....the rest is history."
603,604,5,"Note, May 4, 2020: Since I read all of the Harry Potter books before joining Goodreads, and since my time limitations are such that it's rare for me to write more than one ""retrospective"" review of books in the same series, I really wrote the material below as a (relatively short!) review of the entire series. So, I thought it might be constructive to add this note clarifying that fact.

Rowling's Harry Potter series, which begins with this book, is one of the greatest works of modern literature, in any genre, and one of the best reading experiences I've ever had in any genre! The characterizations, especially of Harry, bring the characters to life and make you care about them; the intricate, carefully-dovetailed plotting (very skillfully incorporating mystery elements; Rowling could have gone to the top of the mystery genre, too!) is worthy of Dickens; and the imaginative details with which the author constructs her wizard's world are breathtaking. Most importantly, the book (and the whole series) has a solid moral grounding, from which it presents a serious tale of the struggle of good and evil. The whole thing is leavened with an adorable sense of humor and fun; and the author deftly weaves in elements drawn from an obviously wide acquaintance with a variety of actual arcane lore. (Of course, the titular ""sorcerer's stone"" of the American edition is the philosopher's stone of medieval alchemy --which the editors thought American readers would be too ignorant to recognize by its proper name.)

Ironically, Rowling (a practicing member of the Church of Scotland, who lists C. S. Lewis and Tolkien among her major literary influences) was pilloried by many Christians as having written a work that glorifies satanism --with which they equate ANY mention of magic in literature. Invocational magic, which calls on dark powers, or seeks to coerce God, to produce its effects, is certainly condemned in Scripture. But magic of the incantational variety --what early modern scholars called ""natural magic""-- which draws on morally neutral, inanimate forces created as part of the universe, analogous to magnetism or electricity (which were both viewed as ""natural magic"" at one time) presents no theological problem for Christians. All of the ""magic"" in this series is strictly of the incantational sort. (Of course, that distinction is lost on those who condemn the series without reading any of it!)"
604,605,5,"Caí en la magia de Harry Potter. He leído muchos libros de fantasía, de magos, de academias de magos... todos posteriores a Harry y ahora entiendo la importancia de esta obra. Un clásico ya, que tendría que haber leído antes."
605,606,5,"5 magic stars

Reading this made me happy. It was like going back to my childhood, when I first heard (and read) about Harry Potter. I was/am one of the lucky ones from the ""Potter generation"", and I have nothing but good things to say about the story, the world, the characters that J. K. Rowling created.

This is exactly the type of book children and young teens should read. Nowadays, mainly girls, are reading stuff that are marketed for older and more mature readers, focused on topics they know nothing about yet and probably shouldn't read about due to not being ready to get the grasp of it and a whole, objective vision of their own after reading said stories (for example, ""BDSM"" stuff that in reality is not BDSM but a ""how-to-be-abused-by-a-bastard"" guide... You know which book I'm talking about. And that one is not the only book with abuse being glamorized.)

This book, even though it's not the written book ever, focuses on the value of friendship, family and team work. It portrays flawed, yet strong characters. And not only male characters, but also female, which is currently hard to find nowadays. Women, girls, are normally being depicted as weak and needy, whose only purpose is to a man in order to find their lives complete, and whose happiness depends solely and exclusively in said man. And to get him, in many books friendship is torn apart just for the sake of getting their love interest. In my opinion, we're sending the wrong message to young girls. Many do believe that, indeed, they need a boyfriend to be happy. That if they don't have one, their worth is less or there's something wrong with them. Society itself promotes the message that if you're a woman and you don't get a man, you failed at life. All I can ask myself is .

In the other hand, Harry Potter shows brave characters, all in its own particular way. Characters that through each book continue to grow and develop. That's why I recommend anyone, young or not, to read these books. At least for the happy old times!

PS: Proud Ravenclaw here! :D"
606,607,5,"This book means so much to me. When I moved to my new school, my first year was not that great. I hate it. I was so used to school of multi-cultural, I felt like an outcast and I felt that my year 3 teacher hated me.

I entered year 4 and I had a wondering English teacher who had just came back from England with a new book that was getting popular over there. It was called Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone . As a reward for completing our work, she would read out the book for us. She had this amazing English accent and the whole class fell in love with this book. I remember begging my parents to order the 2nd and 3rd book on bookclub. This book helped me to love my school, to feel that I belonged part of a school community again.

I entered year 5 and I have to say I did not like my teacher at all. I got really in trouble one day and my mum made me write an apology letter (and looking back I was a little shit) and I gave her my first Harry Potter book to borrow as an apology present. She fell in love with Harry Potter and became one of my favorite teachers. This book helped me to bond with this amazing teacher named Ms Campbell and because of her (and my Year 4 teacher Ms Williams) I studied to become a teacher.

was a book I went to whenever I needed motivation, felt sad, bored, angry, alone or just needed to escape from the world. It helped me bond with my classmates, helped me decide my career and is my always constant friend.

is more than a book. It is everything to me. So thank you for not giving up and writing this amazing series!"
607,608,5,"Eu nunca li Harry Potter, assim como nunca vi os filmes, cheguei a ver uns 5 minutos mas depois fartei-me. Na minha infância não escolhi ler os livros, optei por outros, e agora arrependo-me. Durante a minha adolescência troquei Harry Potter por outros livro, e arrependo-me. Com 17 anos, comprei o meu primeiro livro de Harry Potter, no meu aniversário por acaso, e passado uns dias decidi o ler.
Como já referi, arrependo-me de não ter lido mais cedo Harry Potter, devia ser maravilhoso pertencer a este mundo quando era mais nova. Um mundo cheio de magia, senti-me em Hogwarts, e apesar de apenas ter lido o primeiro livro já estou à espera de ler o resto. Eu quero mais Harry Potter, quero ler os livros todos e depois ver os filmes, e poder juntar-me a todos os fãs e partilhar ideias acerca de Harry Potter.
Todos falavam tão bem de Harry Potter e eu ignorava, apenas mais uma saga famosa. Mas na verdade não é apenas mais uma saga famosa, é a melhor saga que já ouvi falar. Estamos a falar de um mundo diferente, totalmente criado pela J. K .Rowling, e podemos dizer que um mundo muito bem criado e pensado. Este livro deixou-me com vontade de fazer as malas e ir para Hogwarts.
Queria terminar os livros ainda este ano, mas penso que não ire conseguir. Queria pelo menos ler até ao quarto volume, mas com o começo das aulas e tudo mais será complicado. E claro, tenho ainda outros livros para ler.
As personagens são tão espetaculares, apaixonei-me por todas as personagens, ganhei tanto carinho por elas. Principalmente pelo Ron, e claro a Hermione. Sempre soube que iria amar a Hermione, como não amar aquela sabichona? E claro, Harry, é impossível não gostar do Harry.
Só tenho uma coisa a dizer, estou à espera da minha carta para Hogwarts."
608,609,5,"I just finished this for the nth time. I also just finished it for the first time. With my Spider! This is my absolute favourite series, and I'm absolutely thrilled at finally being able to share it with her.

I didn't read these as a child, because, well, old. However, it hasn't affected my enjoyment of these books even the tiniest bit. Although this first book is, admittedly, simplistic in comparison to later books in the series, it needs to be. I find it just complex enough to hook older readers (in my case, I was around 25 when I first read this), and of course, on re-reads, I always get just a little bit more out of them. I adore the humour (admittedly, a fair bit of it goes over the Spider's head), the friendship between the trio, but most of all, the characters are truly wonderful - particularly the adults. They are complex and flawed, and in Minerva McGonagall's case especially, totally kick-arse.

The series is, quite simply, magical.

And then, to watch my Spider experience them was another level of magic entirely. Seeing the excitement on her face, listening to her beg for ""Just one more chapter, pleeeeeeeease! You can't end it on a cliffhanger like that!"" is just the best. Just when I thought I couldn't love these books more, there it is. Thanks, J.K.

We watched the movie this past weekend, just after finishing the book, and I was amazed at how much the Spider remembered. She could even pick which two trials (at the end) were missing in the movie, compared to the book. I know that there are haters out there, but I honestly don't think that there are many books that are so beloved by both children and adults - and to me, that's some bloody clever writing."
609,610,5,"Ďalší rereading za mnou, už to ani nepočítam.
Tento raz to však bolo o dosť iné. Ku knihe som prišiel po dvojročnej nečítacej pauze. Proste sa mi nedalo ešte aj voľný čas tráviť pri knihách--nazvime to choroba z povolanie.
A potom som si povedal, že to prelomím.
No prvé dve-tri kapitoly boli utrpením. Čítal som ich rýchlosťou skapínajúceho slimáka. Proste sa to nedalo, a šlo to horšie ako v lete na saniach. Ale keď sa zjavil Hagrid... a všetka tá mágia... tak ja som mal opäť 13, a prvý raz som nakukol do sveta Harryho Pottera.
Čítanie mi šlo pomaly, čo však nebolo na škodu. Aj po toľkých rereadingoch som si všímal nové veci. Aj dejové, aj spisovateľské.
Hlavne zisťujem, ako filmy strašne zmenili moju pamäť na knihy... veci sa proste diali inak!!!
A JKR je fakt spisovatelka ineho rangu ako ostatní... jej slovná zásoba ma fascinuje. Aj to aké slová používa a podobne.
Proste super. A už aj čítam dvojku!!!

Sú knihy a knihy.
S Harrym Potterom som vyrastal, bola to pravdopodobne prvá kniha, ktorú som čítal dokolečka :) Mám v živej pamäti tie Vianoce, keď rodičia kúpili ten diel bratovi, a on to odmietal čítať, tak ja som si knihu vzal a hneď pekne polovičku pod stromčekom prečítal. Tento xtý rereading som si užíval ešte viac. A už to nebolo o deji, o dobrodružstve, ale akosi som sa sústredil na ich priateľstvo, je to úplne krásne popísané!!!
Och, Hermiona je úžasná :)"
610,611,5,"My third journey with Harry Potter at his first year at Hogwarts, this time with superb illustrations of Jim Kay.

To be honest, I expected more of the illustrations. I mean, not the illustrations, but their placement with the text and their intensity. Jim Kay, he really did his work in a rather impressive, fantastic way. He made this world more fabulous than it is. .

It's just, there was something missing, a little flaw I can barely see it. It deserves the five stars, no doubt in that. We just needed an illustration of the trio playing Wizard's Chess at the end, a clear illustration of Voldemort not just a red eye behind a piece of cloth, one for Ron's family or at least the twins, another for that nearly-main character in that volume, Professor Quirell, one of the Philosopher's Stone itself!

As for the illustrations we have, I really admire how the illustrator created the drawings of the castle and every wizarding object or place, especially that one of the three goal posts of the Quidditch pitch at school and the one on the cover. I also liked the ""Guide to Trolls"" and such pages in the book, clever illustrations.

A re-read helped me to retrieve my best memories of a year ago when I started reading this series, though that's my least favorite chapter among them all. I only owe it those happy memories. I discovered more meanings than the first read, and found more depth in the characters; in Neville's especially."

This book was just so awesome and I'm actually really happy that I have no idea what to expect even though it's also killing me not knowing.

639,640,5,"¿Alguna vez volviste a un lugar que no visitabas desde la infancia, y notaste que era mucho más chico de lo que recordabas? Algo así me pasa con este libro, que leí por primera vez hace más de veinte años. En ese momento, me pasó lo que a miles y millones de otros chicos. Quedé fascinado. Lo releí. A medida que fue creciendo la serie, y yo también, me hice la tradición de releer todos los libros que ya tenía cada vez que estaba por publicarse uno nuevo, y así lo hice hasta la cuarta o la quinta entrega. Estoy tan desorientado como cualquier hijo de vecino a la hora de explicar el fenómeno cultural que produjeron esos libros, y del que participé, pero puedo decir que para mí, la serie de fue en esos años una forma de la felicidad.

Cuando por fin llegaron las últimas entregas, un tanto demoradas, me dio la impresión de que no estaban a la altura, o quizás había pasado demasiado tiempo y yo estaba ya en un punto muy distinto de mi vida y de mis intereses literarios. Pero siempre tuve la idea de, en algún momento, volver a leerlos y ver qué había ahí. Se sabe que tratar de volver a un lugar en el que uno fue feliz es poco recomendable, pero sólo si lo que se busca es reeditar esa felicidad pasada. Este es un río que no cambia, pero nosotros sí lo hacemos, y, aunque los artefactos sean en rigor los mismos, ya no son capaces de causarnos el mismo efecto. Pero también en eso hay nuevos placeres que descubrir. Releer un libro que en otro tiempo nos fascinaba es un poco como leer nuestra propia historia. Recordamos el efecto que nos causaba; lo entendemos, en algunos puntos, y en otros nos parece un misterio, y eso nos da una pauta de la distancia recorrida entre la persona que somos y la que fuimos, como si el otro fuera también un personaje literario. Ese es uno de los poderes hermosos de la literatura.

, me doy cuenta, no es tan grande como yo la recordaba. Ni el libro es tan extenso, ni la historia tan compleja como me parecía entonces. Y, si bien transcurre en un mundo interesante, puedo ver ahora que ese mundo también tiene límites muy claros. Si esperaba otra cosa, puede decirse que es porque leí los libros subsiguientes, donde el universo y la trama se ampliaron de manera considerable. Pero no; me acuerdo bien de que (cuando lo leí la primera vez fue como un , sin sospechar que pudiera ser la primera parte de una serie) me transmitía ya la idea de un mundo enorme e insondable, que me daba ganas de seguir explorando y que nunca terminaba de satisfacerme. Es la característica fundamental a la que debería aspirar toda obra de fantasía. Rowling, por supuesto, no fue la primera en lograr algo así, pero sí sorprende que lo haya logrado con tan poco.

, como corresponde a una novela infantil, se concentra en la narración. Rowling no se detiene mucho en las descripciones, y prefiere caracterizar a los personajes usando arquetipos ya conocidos. La acción avanza muy rápido, y abundan las elipsis – lo que es lógico, ya que el libro resume todo un año escolar en un par de centenares de páginas. A simple vista, parecería que Rowling viola la regla de oro de la narrativa: “mostrar, no contar”. Pero está claro que, como todas las reglas, esta exige una interpretación. La interpretación sería: siempre que hagamos narrativa vamos a contar y mostrar; lo importante es elegir bien qué cosas vamos a contar, y elegir todavía mejor qué cosas vamos a mostrar. Eso es lo que supo hacer la autora de , con una economía narrativa que deberían tener en cuenta los aspirantes a escritores de fantasía (y quizás ella misma debería haber contemplado, alas, antes de escribir ). En lugar de construir –a lo Tolkien- un mundo completo y complejo, que tuviera que explicarse después mediante anexos y mediante otros libros, prefirió presuponer ese mundo, y sugerirnos su existencia a través de un puñado de indicios certeros.

Doy algunos ejemplos. Uno de los grandes aciertos de Rowling fue mezclar el tema de la magia con el mundo del consumo. Los unicornios, los dragones y los castillos tienen lo suyo, pero difícilmente resultan originales. Ahora: ¿un negocio de varitas mágicas? ¿Grajeas de todos los sabores, incluyendo cera de oídos y vómito? ¿Escobas voladoras de distintas calidades, y con nombres como Nimbus 2000? ¿Deportes mágicos? En y en las siguientes entregas de la serie, siempre hay algún triunfo en esa intersección entre el universo de la magia y los productos muggles (la carpa de tres ambientes es mi ejemplo favorito). Quizás se trate de una fantasía anarcocapitalista, como Ilias Yocaris. Ciertamente, fue un aspecto que facilitó el merchandising y, en consecuencia, el éxito de la serie.

También me parece que hay cierta nostalgia millenial en la cruda de estos objetos. Para nosotros, en nuestra realidad digital, tiene algo tranquilizador volver a un mundo donde los mensajes se mandan mediante lechuzas y tardan días en llegar, los chicos toman apuntes con tinta y plumas, y se sigue usando el fuego como fuente de iluminación. Ahora dejemos de lado la teoría y observemos otra vez cómo Rowling construye este aspecto de su mundo: hay una escena importante en Diagon Alley, después otra en el Expreso Hogwarts, y poco más. No ofrece un catálogo de todo lo que podríamos encontrar; nos entrega apenas unos botones de muestra, y deja que los lectores lleguemos al resto por simple inducción. Para Harry no parece haber limitaciones en este sentido, porque tiene acceso (vieja fantasía infantil) al infinito dinero de sus padres; sin embargo, no vemos que lo use, o no vemos que lo use de la manera que nosotros querríamos hacerlo. En la restricción está la clave de infinito.

Este modo de contar necesitaba un personaje como Harry, escasamente curioso y con una tendencia marcada a dejarse llevar por los acontecimientos. Un aventurero. Si la protagonista hubiese sido una Hermione, ansiosa por saber todo sobre ese nuevo mundo, y por dominarlo, el libro habría sido muy distinto, y probablemente un fiasco. No voy a ahondar mucho más en el personaje de Harry, porque ya lo hice en otras partes, pero sí a reforzar la misma conclusión: no es un buen protagonista, pero es el protagonista que tenía que tener esta saga. El héroe que necesitábamos, no el que nos merecíamos realmente. O algo así.

Las pequeñas escenas sirven también para insinuar un universo mayor en lo que hace a la vida en Hogwarts. Otra de las genialidades de Rowling fue descubrir que podían reciclarse las viejas historias de internado () inglesas, y que estas podían ser de interés para un público moderno. Sólo hacía falta cambiar la ambientación por una apropiadamente excéntrica. Y si la historia suma interés con los implementos mágicos que se van mostrando, y con las aventuras que tienen lugar, gana en humanidad con las pequeñas escenas cotidianas de la vida en Hogwarts. Hay personajes (eminentemente, los mellizos Weasley) cuya función principal es reforzar este aspecto, más que ayudar a que la trama avance.

Nada de esto significa que el libro no tenga sus problemas. Claro que los tiene. La escritura es bastante mediocre, si bien casi siempre cumple con lo que se requiere de ella. Su cosmovisión es bastante simplista, por momentos contradictoria, y esto, que sería excusable en un libro infantil, y en el primer libro de una serie, no hace sino acentuarse en los libros siguientes. La historia, que otrora me parecía un misterio sublime, es objetivamente bastante predecible, y adolece del mismo problema que la primera película de Indiana Jones: el héroe resulta totalmente irrelevante para la trama y para la derrota final del villano, y sólo está ahí para que nosotros podamos ver lo que sucede. Es más: podríamos argumentar que, sin la presencia de Harry, Quirrel habría quedado atrapado en la última cámara, permitiendo que Dumbledore retuviera a Voldemort de una manera más efectiva. Pero claro: de ser así, no habría más que este libro.

Además, están los problemas derivados de la construcción de mundo. Sí, recién dije que la forma más bien vaga e improvisada con la que Rowling encaró este aspecto era una de sus fortalezas. Lo sostengo. Sin embargo, tengamos presente que la magia, en este libro, funciona siempre y cuando no le pidamos consistencia. Su función es hacer un mundo fascinante y misterioso, y mantener la tensión dramática; pero las reglas que la gobiernan cambian según lo requiera la trama, y se contradicen despreocupadamente unas a otras. Si uno está prestando atención, estas contradicciones saltan todo el tiempo (y sí, sé que hay toda una comunidad en Internet dispuesta a mostrar que no son tales, pero ).

A medida que Harry crece, y con él también crecen las pretensiones de la serie, se agravan estos problemas. Rowling lucha por crear un mundo más oscuro y complejo, pero esa complejidad estaba limitada por las bases que había sentado en este aquel primer libro. El mundo mágico, al final de la serie, da la impresión de ser un pueblo chico, donde todos se conocen con todos y nadie tiene mucho para hacer. A fin de cuentas, es un mundo que no sirve para otra cosa que para entretenernos, y tampoco tiene mucho para ofrecer a sus personajes una vez que se terminan las aventuras (la reciente obra es una muestra bastante abominable de ello). Es fácil no ver estos problemas en el espacio más restringido de , pero le pertenecen de todas maneras como parte fundacional de la heptalogía. La lección acá es que aumentar desmedidamente las ambiciones de un proyecto no necesariamente sirve para mejorarlo.

Me da la sensación de que la serie de se encontró a medio camino con una tensión entre forma y contenido; los personajes y los temas estaban creciendo, pero hacer el salto de novela infantil a adolescente implicó decisiones estéticas que no terminaron nunca de cerrar. En el terreno infantil es donde Rowling se maneja más cómoda, y por eso las primeras novelas son mucho más divertidas que las últimas, por más que se les elogie la “adultez”. La adultez no la veo. Es más, para los propios personajes de , nunca deja de ser un territorio lejano e incierto. Todos se terminan casando con sus novies de la secundaria y aparecen los hijos con nombres de fallecidos padres y mentores, como mostrando que no hay nada nuevo bajo el sol, y tratando de mantener viva la historia de Hogwarts, el único momento en el que el mundo parecía emocionante y lleno de posibilidades – es decir, la infancia.

Si , pese a sus falencias, sigue siendo un éxito, y probablemente llegue a convertirse en un clásico, es gracias a los primeros libros, como , que nos despertaron el hambre con su inventiva, y sirvieron para impulsar toda una serie que quizás no debería haber sido tan larga. Además, ya es un fenómeno que va más allá de lo literario, y su supervivencia no depende exclusivamente de que los libros sigan gustando. Como le ha pasado a otros personajes extremadamente populares, como Superman o Sherlock Holmes, Harry parece camino a convertirse en un ícono gracias a la potencia imaginativa de su mundo. Puede ser, si eso pasa, que termine ocupando un lugar más bien menor dentro del tapiz potteriano; pero también va a tener la mística agregada, la irremplazable, de haber sido su punto de partida."
640,641,5,"I am 18 yrs late to this party and to make a review on this book in 2016 is probably silly.

This was published few years after I was born and gotten its hype in the early 2000s, well based on where I'm from, Philippines. My cousins were so utterly obsessed on the films (apparently they're not into books, only me and my uncle loves to read) and they would watch HP films over and over again. I lost count on how many times they've watched it in our family room, every time they'd get. Back then I think they're crazy. The wizard world just did not interest me.

I was into something only grown-ups were allowed to read. But I still did since I was fff excited to grow-up only to find out is never fun at all. Also, what I was reading back then were works of , and all those other crime-mystery novels I could easily get off of our shelf.

Then there came the *cringe*

Not reading HP when I should have, years ago, was my choice. I guess the hype was to blame since everyone was talking about HP left and right and since I was a rebel, I did not gave-in. I also did not watched the films although we have all the CDs back home. I didn't know what I was getting myself into but what I now know was, although I've missed so much on enjoying this magical series when I was younger, I could still catch-up on it and experience it all, and feel like I'm a kid again. As cliche as it may sound, it never is too late for Hogwarts.

I may have lost those years, but Harry Potter will always be there to bring me to a world where good triumphs evil, where friendship is true and gold, where everything is possible, and where does exists."

I want to go to Hogwarts.
I want to be sorted into Hufflepuff and wear their yellow and black robes. I want to take Charms, Herbology, Transfiguration, and fail D.A.T.D.A. I want to climb the stands to watch Quidditch and not mind when Hufflepuff loses spectacularly. I want to make two very best friends and have adventures. I want to be chased down the corridors by Peeves and have to say a funny password to get into my dormitory. I want to eat the fabulous end of the year feast and go home for the summer warm and full of memories. 💌💌💌

Harry Potter will always be my all-time favorite series. I could read it over and over and again and never tire of it. It's the book my children will have no choice but to read and love as much as I do! 😆💘

Whenever someone tells me they like to read I ALWAYS ask, ""have you read Harry Potter?"" I feel like everyone deserves to read it at least once in their lifetime- the story, the characters, will stay with you forever!!!

My fav thing about this one is how little they are! They get so old in the other books, and I just love them being so cute and wholesome. 🥹🥹🥹

Harry, Ron, and Hermione are my babies, and I will adore them forever! <3 Hermione is my favorite of course, but don't tell them that. 🤫🤍

okay as usual this review turned into me ranting about how much I love it instead of reviewing the actual book lol.

But lemme tell you.
the plot, the characters, the writing style, the setting, the iconic lines are EVERYTHING. The feeling of drinking tea under a cozy blanket on a cold day? This book is that feeling on pages! 📖☕✨

onto the second one! ahhh so excited to continue reliving my favorite adventure!

mwah! 👋🏻🥰"
642,643,5,"I don’t have anything to add about this book – the story, the characters, the complex world that JK Rowling created – that I didn’t say on my last re-read. I love it as much now as I did when I first picked up the audiocassettes from a bargain bin, skeptical but figuring that I ought to see what the fuss was about.

Instead, I’m going to review this specific edition, an oversized “deluxe format” hardcover illustrated by Jim Kay. It added another dimension of pleasure to my eleventy-billionth re-read, for the heavy weight of it, the tactile sense of turning the thick, almost card stock quality pages, and the visual texture on every page. Even those pages with no illustrations have a sort of inkspotted parchment look.

But the illustrations! I love Jim Kay’s interpretation of the scenes and characters. Some pages are just decorated with little elements from the stories.


Every chapter has an illustrated header.


Some pages are text superimposed over an illustration.


But there are also several full page, standalone illustrations.


This edition was horrifically expensive. But so very worth it. I’ll be buying all seven books for my collection. I read this for the square"
643,644,5,"“It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.”

Okay, but why does the whole world stop when I immerse myself in a Harry Potter book for the umpteenth time? I absolutely cannot get enough of this glorious world and enchanting characters.

I'm sure everyone has read this book at least once. (If you haven't yet, I implore you to).

But why do people go back to relive it multiple times? I'll tell you what I find so alluring about this magnificent book.

Firstly, because ✨ m a g i c ✨. I love everything about the wizarding world and would sell my soul to go to Hogwarts. The world-building is so exquisitely done, each book just has more and more to offer.

And then, pretty much everything else. I love the characters to death. The Golden Trio is friendship goals. Hermione, the queen of intellect and rationality. Harry, the brave and daring one. And Ron, the goofy and sarcastic one. (Obviously, there is more to each of them than I can express in mere words).

The banter is delicious and watching this beautiful friendship grow throughout the 7 books has been a gift. I love their visits to Hagrid's hut and the rapport they share with him. Hagrid is one of my favourite characters too!

Then there are the well-crafted villains. I'm not talking about Lord Voldemort, but Snape, Draco Malfoy and Filch. Tell me you don't detest them, and I won't believe you.

And then, QUIDDITCH!! And Dumbledore. And the other characters, especially Neville, who I can't help but feel sorry for all the time. And the Hogwarts castle and feasts and the Gryffindor common room.

This book is perfect in every way possible.

(I'm blind to any flaws in this series, so tell me that the book had a weak climax or whatever.)"
644,645,5,"Reread 2022: Happy 25th Anniversary Harry, Ron and Hermione! My goodness time has flown. I still enjoy reading these books all these years later. Review from 2017 below.

-----------------------

Happy 20th Anniversary Harry, Ron and Hermione! In honor of this event I decided to interrupt my current book and reread the Sorcerer's Stone. It was around the time the 5th book was going to publish that I originally read the books. A friend at work had just started reading the series and I was intrigued after seeing the first couple movies. As she finished them she would loan them to me to read. It was so much fun and I loved sharing the experience.

While I think most of the world has read the books or at least seen the movies, in case you haven't...Young Harry was just a baby when his parents died. He has been living with his aunt and uncle ever since, who treat him horribly. On his 11th birthday Harry receives a letter inviting him to go study at Hogwarts School of Magic and become a wizard! Off Harry goes to school where he makes friends and thwarts an evil plot by a dark wizard.

This story is just so much fun. I love the world of wizards and witches JK Rowling has created. The magic is funny and inventive, the school dynamics and making friends are so universal that pretty much everyone can identify with them, the characters are memorable, there's an evil to be defeated and Harry's hero journey is just getting started. The story has a few inconsistencies that bug me a little, but it's not enough to spoil the overall magical experience."

finally read it.

you'll be out buying the other books just so you can stay with harry and his friends a little bit longer as they carry on their adventure! I read the whole series in 8 days. 😁🤩
The story of the boy who lived. This is the book where harry one of the main character of the book learns who he really is,(;a wizard) it’s about how his life changes and then how he faces the one who was killed his parents. While reading this book I felt like I was on the journey with Harry, exploring everything (about his new life new everything about Hogwarts).
Harry Potter is full of amazing characters like Harry, Hermione, Draco Malfoy ,luna Lovegood, Albus Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagle, Hagrid, Hedwig, and many more... 💜

I watch the movie as well and 💯 all the actors have done justice to there parts. Being this such a big movie binger I do not know how I am saying this but I am that the book are more precious to me. And cannot be replaced by movies at all. BOOKS ARE MAGICAL!!!!!
I absolutely loved there acting :- Tom Felton, Emma Watson ,Daniel Radcliffe, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, Matthew lewis & Sean Biggerstaff 🎭

646,647,5,"Just wanted to spend two words on this piece of art before starting Chamber of Secrets illustrated that I just received *screams*

This book for me will be forever sacred. It's the very first book that I read 100% without the help of anybody, I was like 7/8 and I fell in love with the Wizarding World immediately.
Of course I didn't get everything at that time because I was probably too young to understand certain things and the book really that you can't actually understand when you are only 7.

I re-read it at least 5/6 times and . , everything is amazing xD

I think almost everyone knows the story... So no plot/summary from me haha
This series is and will ever be a HUGE part of my life and everything started with this particular book.

Last but not least: , which ! The pictures are just eye candy, I like how it's written in columns and the full page illustrations are everything awww **"

I mean the movies are probably enough. I can't say all Arab people, but most of them. I always see the book set wherever I go and I tell myself it's just for kids. Then one day I got the first book may be two or three years ago to read it someday.
Every Christmas I see all my bookstagrammers friends around the world post pics about Harry Potter books. to read his books with a cup of hot coffee or coco. And I wanted to join.
I'm 23 now and thanks God that I read at least the first one, and I wanted to finish it before January. And guess what... . It was WOW! I just felt that I want to go in public and say PEOPLE YOU MUST READ THIS. Really J.K Rowling is brilliant. I mean to create a magical world includes another magical worlds like this!

To be honest I'm not a big fan of Daniel, however I liked him in the movie, but people the book was also soooo good. *fingers crossed* I got the second book while I was reading the first one. Harry I'm with you till the END.

Que puedo decir,el boom de Harry Potter me pilló algo mayor y aunque ese pensamiento ya es un grave error,era lo que siempre pensé,pero siempre hay alguien que pone a cada uno en su lugar y en mi caso fué mi hijo,de tan sólo 6 añitos quien me llevó a leer esta maravilla.
Me embarqué en la lectura de esta preciosidad sólo por el echo de poder compartir con el esa ilusión que desprendía cada vez que me decía papá tienes que leerlo y así podemos hablar de cosas de Harry Potter...
A parte de todo esto,tengo que decir que tampoco he visto ninguna película y que lo que más me a sorprendido de mucho es la pluma de la escritora,de qué manera te envuelve en ese mundo que a creado,con unos personajes brutales,con personalidades marcadísimas absolutamente todos,con tanta descripción sutil sin caer en la pesadez pero haciéndote ver absolutamente cada escena descrita,haciéndolo tan fácil,tan accesible,tan para todos.
Chapeau por esta gran joya que recomiendo a cualquier tipo de lector que ame mínimamente la fantasía.

Seguiré disfrutando de esta preciosa saga compartiéndola con mi pequeño lector ❤️."
649,650,5,"Such a warm bath of nostalgia, every chapter is exciting, brings something new of the Wizarding World to the fore and builds to the conclusion.

Harry Potter has and always will have a special place in my heart, so my rating comes as no surprise. It’s one of those books that will take you on a journey without you having to leave your seat.

The writing was smooth, fast paced, and had me hooked from the start. It was like a gunshot at a race. Once the bullet rung out, I was dashing for the finish line. Not once did I get bored while reading this book.

I loved all the characters (even the antagonists) especially Harry Potter and I love how J.K. Rowling was able to put so much depth in all of them! They each had their own personalities and flaws which made them more relatable and easy to connect to.

Besides the characters, the world building seemed complex and slightly headache giving but in a curious way, I was just so into the whole houses and their systems. I also love all the plot twists! Although I’ve seen the movie, my jaw still drops every time there’s a plot twist... "
650,651,5,"For the Illustrated Edition: This book completely re-imagines characters we're familiar with in a beautiful and insightful way. It features double page layout drawings, small inset illustrations and full page images.

Questa edizione è quella definitiva. Le illustrazioi - ispirate alle descrizioni del libro, non ai film! - sono splendide. Le pagine non illustrate sembrano essere scritte sul pattern di una pergamena. La qualità della carta patinata è ottima. La rilegatura non ha problemi, nonostante il peso.
Perfetto."

677,678,5,"EDIT 9/18/13: Rereading (again) with Litchick and Tandie and a while bunch of other lovelies starting November 18. JOIN US!

I must have reread this series about 5 times, but I still remember the way it felt to experience it for the first time. I was introduced to the world of Harry Potter at the age of eight when I watched the first Harry Potter movie. I was enthralled. When I turned nine, I noticed that many of my classmates were carrying around these huge books, so I decided to pick up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I can honestly say it changed my life.

Before HP I did like to read, but it wasn't really all that big of a deal to me. When I finished the first Harry Potter book, it was like a spell was cast on me (hehe). I went out and got the rest of the books immediately and I flew through each one. When there were no more HP books to read, I went into a sort of withdrawal, counting down the days until the next installment became available. I went and watched all the movies on opening weekend. I was utterly obsessed.

The thing that I am most grateful for is the love of reading that was instilled in me as a result of JK Rowling's books. Once I got a taste of the excitement of reading, I couldn't stop. And that, my friends, is why reading is now my favorite thing to do. That is why I began to write my own stories, plays, and poems, and am currently working on a novel that I hope to publish one day. I owe all this to JK Rowling. I can't thank her enough for what her books have done for me.

The story of Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old boy horribly abused and neglected by his ""family,"" if you can even call the Dursleys a family, was one that saddened me when I first read of it. It still saddens me to this day. Still, as a little kid, whenever I went through some hard times, I always told myself that Harry had it worse than me and he endured. I aspired to be like Harry. If he could deal with the Dursleys, then I could deal with whatever life threw at me. Harry Potter is the kind of kid I would love to have as a friend. He's brave, humble, and loyal. I find myself forgetting that he's a fictional character as I read, but at the same time wishing with all my heart that I could meet someone like him.

And then we have Ron. Ron was hilarious, what with his dry humor and sarcasm that never came across as bitter or like he was trying too hard. While I noticed that he was self-conscious about his family's financial situation, he wasn't all ""woe is me"" about it. He was a good and loyal friend to Harry.

As for Hermione, I adored her. I found myself connecting with her on such a personal level. I could relate to almost everything she went through. I also happen to have a mane of bushy brown hair, brown eyes, buck teeth (before I got braces), and a love of books and libraries. I too am a huge goody-two-shoes that many people would consider smart. But most of all, I have a habit of shooting my hand up in the air every time a teacher asks a question. Snape would probably despise me. Hermione was practical, smart, responsible, and a great friend. Her amazing cleverness and skill in magic is even more commendable because of the fact that she's Muggle-born. She'd had no prior experience with magic of any kind before coming to Hogwarts, and still she came out top of her class in her first year. Take that, Draco!

Speaking of Draco, allow me to rant about the obnoxious git. He was the most contemptible, pompous, jealous, spoiled little brat I've ever encountered in a book. He seemed to have absolutely nothing better to do than follow Harry and his friends around and ruin their lives in any way possible. Ugh. Someone needs to hit this kid. Still, there's a part of me that feels bad for Draco too. I think all of his hatred for Harry and his friends is really jealousy. Think about it this way. Harry had great friends, Draco has dumb, mean cronies. Harry is famous, Draco doesn't get any attention. Harry's great at quidditch, Draco's not really good at anything (though he does excel in douchebaggery). While the bad still outweighs the good, we have to remember that he's just a lonely, jealous kid that needs to lash out at someone.

Now lets talk about one of my favorite characters: Severus Snape. I love him. Is that so wrong? I adore that man. My opinion of him has never changed. Sure, I knew he was a jerk in all the books and I got so angry at him at those times. At the same time, though, I was thoroughly amused by his sarcastic, caustic wit. You have to admit, he's funny, mysterious, complex, and even sexy, in his own weird way. As I continued with the series, I grew stronger feelings for him. Stronger annoyance at his bouts of meanness, stronger understanding of why he did what he did, and finally, in the last book, a stronger love and respect of his character. The first time I read Sorcerer's Stone, I was so confused! Did he hate Harry or didn't he? Was he trying to kill Harry or save him? This is what I love most about Snape. The inner machinations of his mind are an enigma (if you know where that line is from, go buy yourself an ice cream).

Then we have Hagrid: the sweetest, cutest giant of them all. I love his adorable accent, his love of deadly animals, and how much of a great father figure he is for Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I think his ludicrous belief that deadly creatures are actually harmless stems from his own personal experience. At first Hagrid seems threatening and hostile because of his size and wild appearance, when really he is a huge sweetheart. In this way, he feels he can relate to the dangerous creatures that he loves. Except the majority of these creatures don't turn out to be sweethearts like Hagrid.

As for the Dursleys, I cannot deal with them. I despise these people. Can't stand them for the life of me. Somehow, I almost find myself hating them more than I hate Voldemort, especially Petunia. God damn it woman, this kid is your BLOOD relative. He is your sister's son, and you treat him like a prisoner. You wouldn't even treat strangers that way! As much as I despised this family, I found them funny as well, particularly Vernon's angry explosions.

And last, but most certainly not least, there is Albus Dumbledore. I love him for his cute craziness, as well as his wisdom. I've never seen a better combination of the two. He is a wonderful father figure for Harry. Still, the mystery surrounding him frustrates me. What did he see in the Mirror of Erised, dammit?! The world will never know.

All in all, this series remains my favorite of all time. Thank you, JK Rowling, for all you've done for me and for millions of other people all over the world."
678,679,5,I don’t know what happened but I used to have a beautiful review of this book and I’m heartbroken that it’s gone because that was such a nostalgic review.
679,680,5,"Me encantó este libro y estoy impresionada por eso! Quiero decir, sabía que me iba a gustar! Pero era mucho más grande de lo que imagine. Desde la primera página me tenía enganchada. J.K. ¡Rowling tiene un estilo de escritura tan fluido! ¡Nunca me aburrí y estaba jadeando en algunas partes, incluso cuando sabía lo que iba a pasar!

No puedo esperar a leer los próximos libros."
680,681,5,"Rereading the Harry Potter series always feels like coming home and reuniting with some of my best friends.

This story is so special to me. My entire childhood is full of moments where I was reading Harry Potter, playing with my friends pretending I was a wizard, and having movie marathons all the time with this series. There isn't much I can say about this series that hasn't already been said, and to be completely honest I always have a difficult time reviewing books when I reread them, so I'm just going to talk about my feelings instead. Sorry if you were hoping for anything more than that!!! :')

Book one is always such a fun adventure to reread. I always seem to forget how quickly this story flies by. I really love the introduction to the world, from explaining the concept of magic to just the general world building...it's all so much fun. I love that JK Rowling is able to give such a brief introduction to the world that still fits perfectly with the things that we learn later on in the series.

I also always seem to forget just how pure and innocent everyone is at the very beginning. It amazes me how Harry who has such a tough life is still full of such hope and desire to do the right thing. He is so young and already has so much on his shoulders, and he just doesn't let it get him down, it makes me really emotional!!! Ron is such a sweetheart in the first book, he is starting to figure himself out and trying to create his own place out of the shadows of his brothers. And my sweet Hermione is figuring out that there is more to life than books and knowledge, and that doing the right thing doesn't always mean following the rules.

The other characters are also great, I love the introduction we get to the other Weasley's, especially the twins *heart eyes*. Draco is such a smug little asshole in this one, but he is still so innocent it's great to see him still being a kid. Hagrid plays a larger role in this one that I remember, but I'm not mad about it. His character provides a nice message to younger readers that mistakes can happen and sometimes good intentions aren't enough. On the other hand I always think that Dumbledore plays a much larger role in this first book than he does, I always seem to forget how behind the scenes he is in the first few books. The introduction to the ghosts, peeves, and the professors feel really fun to me since I know what to expect from them throughout the rest of the series.

This was basically just a trip down memory lane, and as always this reread has my heart feeling incredibly full and also incredibly torn because I know that there is pain waiting for me as the series continues."
681,682,5,"This was family read with my son, so understandably there was a two way magic coming both from pages and my son’s heart. I haven’t read any Harry P. book before, nor have I watched the movies. And now I’m glad I didn’t because I have a chance to enjoy even more watching my boy’s eyes widen while Harry and the gang fight Voldemort. ❤️"
682,683,5,"Aviso antes de empezar que esta no es una reseña especial ni el relato de cómo comenzó mi amor por la literatura. Sólo es la historia de alguien que, como tantos otros de mi generación, tuvo la maravillosa fortuna de crecer junto a Harry.

No estoy segura de si Harry llegó a mi vida el día que cumplí nueve o diez años. Unos amigos de mis abuelos, a sabiendas de cuánto me gustaba leer, me regalaron por mi cumpleaños mi más que manoseado ejemplar de , diciendo que el libro se había puesto de moda y que parecía que gustaba bastante. La verdad sea dicha, mi capacidad crítica era nula en esos momentos y leía todo lo que caía en mis manos, así que no le di la menor importancia. Hasta que comencé a leer y Harry me atrapó.

No soy consciente de cómo llegaron a mis manos ni el segundo ni el tercer libro, pero sé que devoré uno detrás de otro y que sufrí una tremenda decepción cuando me acerqué a la papelería de al lado de mi casa y me dijeron que el cuarto libro no estaba publicado. ¡Fue la primera vez que tuve que esperar a que se publicase un libro!

Esperé mi carta de Hogwarts con ahínco durante un par de años. Soñaba con llegar allí y vivir las aventuras que vivía Harry. Tengo el recuerdo de estar en mi habitación haciendo cábalas sobre mi edad y la de los personajes para saber si coincidiría o no con ellos en clase.

Harry Potter me descubrió un mundo repleto de magia, amistad y fantasía. A día de hoy, mis ejemplares de la saga siguen teniendo un lugar privilegiado en mis estanterías, a pesar de tener los lomos desgastados y las páginas amarillentas de tanto leerlos. Soy consciente de que no son libros perfectos y de que la saga tiene contradicciones y errores, pero nada me ha hecho llorar como la muerte de Fred o la de Dobby. Y ningún otro libro me impulsó a escribir tanto como lo hizo este.

Gracias a Harry me adentré en el mundo del fanfiction donde, no sólo mejore como escritora y me animé a publicar (de manera amateur), sino que conocí a personas maravillosas que forman parte de mi vida desde hace años, enriqueciéndola de muchísimas formas.

La saga de Harry Potter me sigue haciendo soñar tanto hoy como la primera vez que me adentré en la normalidad del número 4 de Privet Drive. Brindemos para que «El niño que vivió» siga viviendo mucho tiempo.

Gracias por todos estos años, J.K.

Una orgullosa Huffie."
683,684,5,"This year marks the 20th anniversary of the very first Harry Potter book so special editions have been released and of course I pre-ordered them months ago.

The story is the original one that we all know about. No amendments there, which is largely due to the fact that we experience stuff from Harry's POV so we only get to see certain common rooms at certain moments in the story.
Therefore, I'd like to conentrate on the extra content in each version as well as the GORGEOUS illustrations:
Every book has the respective house crest with the three characteristics in the beginning, followed by the individual chapters, in this case:
- Gryffindor: An Introduction
- Making Gryffindor Proud
- House Founder: Godric Gryffindor
- House Relic
- House Livery
- House Ghost
Then comes the actual story, followed by:
- The Sorting
- Hogwarts Quiz
- House Common Room
- Memorable Gryffindor Students
- Famous Gryffindor Alumni
- Head of Gryffindor House
- The House Cup
- J.K. Rowling, Twenty Years of Magic

Moreover, each book also has a pretty map of Hogwarts and its grounds:

Throughout the book, there are various illustrations unique to the respective house (of the house ghost, founder or head of house etc) by Levi Pinfold, which is really giving this an extra edge (just like the sprayed edges that are like the house livery).

The crests on the dust jackets are especially nice because of the contrast, which is why I decided t get the hardcovers and not the paperbacks.

It's a little bit of a cheat since I didn't re-read the entire book (especially not 4 times) but concentrated on the extra content and illustration, but although I knew the extra content from the early days of Pottermore, I still enjoyed this very much."
684,685,5,"NEREYE AĞLIYORDUK A DOSTLAR?

685,686,5,"Okay so I think I'm the only person standing on this earth who has not read the Harry Potter series yet, and here, this is my first ever book for J K Rowling.

I have watched the movies so many times, however. I can quote the movies actually, and I am very glad that for this book, the movie follows exactly everything in details. The book isn't relatively long anyway, not many fillers were there, it was a sequence of ongoing adventures, which by the way was the best part about it. But anyway I believe that contributed to the fact that the storyline isn't altered all that much in the movie.

After failing at picking a good story book to read for what feels like forever, I have picked this up because I know you can never go wrong with HP, and that could be the truest thing I have said in my life. And though I knew the story, I was still very thrilled reading through the pages of the book.

To say this is a page turner is an understatement, I enjoyed everything about it. The writing however sounded a bit middle grade, but I am so excited to see the character development along the series, as well as how she, Ms. Rowling, grew as a writer (mind you, not that there was anything wrong with this one)"
686,687,5,"I haven't read the Harry Potter books in soooooo long but boy oh boy THEY ARE JUST AS AMAZING AS EVER!!! <3

I love looking back at how different this first book is compared to the last- even though I think Rowling gew massively as an author over the course of this series but the writing in this book is just so whimsical and magical and reflects the age Harry is at perfectly.

The story in this book is so fun and exciting!!! I love all the little adventures Harry, Ron and Hermione go on like the fight with the troll and the journey through the trapdoor. Harry and Ron's friendship is s lovely in this book- I love how they meet on the Hogwarts Express when Harrry buys all the sweets from the trolley :) Hermione is as amazing as ever in this book I adore her so much and I love how she really holds her own throughout this book. Also how can I forget Neville ( he's my favourite character from the series) I JUST LOVE HIM SO MUCH and it makes me so sad in this book when Malfoy bullies him. BUT WHEN HE WINS THE HOUSE CUP FOR GRYFINDOOR IS JUST MY FAVOURITE MOMENT!!!"
687,688,5,"Für dieses Hörbuch muss man einfach 5 Sterne geben. Ich weiß nicht wie oft ich diesen ersten Teil von Harry Potter schon gelesen / gehört habe, aber es begeistert mich doch immer wieder. Ich kenne Passagen wirklich auswendig und doch finde ich die Geschichte immer wieder spannend und will weiter und weiter lesen / hören.

Rufus Beck ist wirklich ein begnadeter Sprecher. Ich kenne niemanden, der allein mit seiner Stimme einen Charakter so lebendig vor meinem inneren Aug formen kann, wie er. Am meisten gefällt mir ja wie er Hagrid und McGonnegal und Vernon spricht xD
Probleme habe ich ein bisschen mit Snape, weil natürlich Alan Rickmanns Stimme die Stimme eines Gottes und der feuchte Traum meiner schlaflosen Nächte ist (wtf) aber wer kann da schon mithalten?

Ich freue mich jedenfalls schon auf den nächsten Teil, weil ich mal wieder traurig war, als der erste Teil vorbei war."
688,689,5,He vuelto a leer la primera aventura de Harry Potter en esta ocasión en ingles para leerlo tal como lo escribió su autora y me sigue pareciendo una joya de la literatura infantil. La primera vez que lo leí fue porque me lo prestaron los miembros mas jóvenes de mi familia diciéndome que me iba a gustar aunque fuera para niños cuando la locura por esta saga ya recorría todo el mundo y incluso ya se habían estrenado alguna de las películas aunque yo no las había visto y me sorprendió porque aunque fuera un libro en principio para niños también enganchaba a los adultos. En esta ocasión cuando ya conozco todo lo que ocurre lo he seguido disfrutando viendo como Rowling ponía en el libro inicial los cimientos de esta historia con la que millones de niños se hicieron lectores empedernidos mientras iban creciendo a la vez que el niño mago.
689,690,5,"Qué delicia de re lectura!. Me sentí niña otra vez. Este universo siempre me encantó, y aquí, en los comienzos hasta los malos tienen cierta inocencia o está caricaturizados (Como sus tíos, con los que aún puedes echarte unas risas... de momento). Recuerdo que la cosa se oscurece luego bastante, pero aquí todavía te absorbe con esa magia de un colegio maravilloso que abre una puerta por la que el protagonista escapa de una vida donde es despreciado a otra mágica y maravillosa donde además es altamente valorado. Con sus más y sus menos, pero ofrece una salida que no le ofrecía el punto de partida inicial. A por la peli y a por el segundo.
Pensaba ponerlo en el reto como libro cuyo título incluye el nombre del protagonista.... pero luego caí en que es re-lectura así que no puede ser.
Pues bueno, que disfruté.

This time I used an audiobook narrated by stephen fry and although I found some voices weird, I like most of it and will continue listening to it until I finish all of the 7 books! Aaaaaand I still like it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


Oh good lord, all my love for harry potter, I got from the movies. I am so happy that I finally, finally get to read them. I am so so so so happy. The plot was amazing, and there were no boring moments, and I think I loved the characters even more. Ron was so funny, harry was sassy and hermione was so witty. I just love this so much omfg.

But I've only got 6 books to read and I'm dreading the moment where I finish this series. I can't.

Someone please perform memory charms on me so i can read it again"
691,692,5,"وقتی شروع کردم به خوندن کتاب های هری پاتر، تا کتاب چهارم ترجمه شده بود و تو کتابخونه موجود بود.
کتاب اول سری هری پاتر، اولین کتاب بیش از 200 صفحه ای بود که خوندم. خواهرم بابت اینکه کارمو راحت کنه سه فصل اولش رو برام تعریف کرد و من تقریبا 50 صفحه ی اولش رو نخوندم. با این که برام حجیم بود اما جذبش شدم و با سرعت کند اون زمانم خوندمش و ازش لذت بردم.
یادمه فصلی که هری و دوستاش برای تنبیه به جنگل ممنوعه رفته بودن رو، یه شب داشتم می خوندم. چون ترسیدم، نتونستم تنها تو اتاق بشینم و بخونم. رفتم توی هال، پیش بقیه ادامه ی کتاب رو خوندم. بعدها که مجدد کتاب رو خوندم، دیدم هیچ موردی نداشته. من از روی بچگی می ترسیدم. حتی الان یادم نیست چه نکته ای باعث شده بود بترسم.
با این که من از هری کم سن تر بودم گاهی از رفتارهای احمقانه ش حرص می خوردم."
692,693,5,"Listening to this made me so incredibly happy. When I read this book for the first time, nearly 20 years ago, I had no idea how much Harry Potter and his friends would become such an integral part of my growing up years. After I read the first book, I followed each subsequent release with great excitement. I re-read them every few years, but I just haven't had the time to do that, so listening it is. It's honestly just a neat coincidence that I happened to be listening to this 20 years from the book's release.

Jim Dale's narration is wonderful. This is my second audio narrated by him, and you can't go wrong with him as the narrator.

Off to start The Chamber of Secrets!"
693,694,5,"Update 2: 30th October 2014.
Oh my God. Sex for the ears, if anything.

Update 1: 13th October 2014.
Re-started the series in audio book form. Needless to say, the hour's drive to university has become so much less painful. Coincidentally, as with my first real page experience, this book has now earned the trophy of my first real audio book experience as well.
Stephen Fry version highly recommended.





My first real read at the tender age of 10. Thank you, Aunty Nasrin, who brought me a copy from London when it was first released and gave meaning to my childhood."
694,695,5,"The first time I read this, at 8, I really liked it.

The second time, when I was 12, I loved it and went on to binge the series.

The third time, at 16, I am once again AWE-STRUCK. I think I can truly appreciate JK Rowling's brilliant now that I've read lots of books and have started writing myself--she is a literary genius.

As we all know, the characters are amazing, the plot is fun, the setting is stunning...basically this book is perfection.

(And I love how at the beginning McGonagal is like ""the whole world will know the name Harry Potter."" Is that a self fulfilling prophecy from JK Rowling? Because it's true, everyone knows his name and story.)"
695,696,5,"Păcat că nu am citit Harry Potter mai demult și înainte de a viziona filmele - prima carte este ideală pentru copii: conține detectiv, mister și prietenie. Dar chiar și acum, la 22 de ani, mi-a plăcut cartea. Există momente care nu au fost incluse în film, așa că au fost o mică noutate. Cartea este plăcută și ușor de citit, sentimentul de a fi într-o școală de magie, a juca Quidditch, a te distra de Crăciun, sentimentul de magie e minunat.
Nu mă voi obosi să spun că această ediție ilustrată a fost o decizie excelentă pentru a face cunoștință cu această carte."
696,697,5,"I did it. I finally read Harry Potter.
My gosh the look on people's faces when I say I haven't read them haha. One down the rest to go.

This book really was wonderful. I was nervous it was going to be boring because I saw all the movies but it wasn't. I really enjoyed finding out more about the world that wasn't in the movies. I also found myself forgetting a bunch of stuff which was nice. I obviously know some big parts of the series due to the movies but this was still just as enjoyable."
697,698,5,"Allereerst wil ik gezegd hebben dat ik niet achter JK Rowling en haar uitspraken omtrent trans vrouwen sta. Transvrouwen zijn vrouwen. Punt.

Daarnaast hou ik niet van de cancelcultuur zoals die nu bestaat en ik hou teveel van Harry Potter om het niet meer te lezen/kijken.
Ik had zoooo veel zin in Harry Potter op maandag. Ik ben met het boek en dekentje op de bank gekropen en ben volledig opgezogen in deze wonderlijke magische wereld. Ik heb er intens van genoten. 5 sterren :)"
698,699,5,"When I read this book it was called Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, but either way this is the book that got people hooked on the series where parents reading the book to their children became interested in the subject themselves and in some cases continued to read after their child had fallen asleep at bedtime."

723,724,5,"The following is an excerpt from a post I wrote about the first two chapters in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Could't post the whole thing because it's stupidly long -- if you want to read more, there's a click-through at the bottom.

CHAPTER ONE: THE BOY WHO LIVED

Certain things are always mentioned when anyone talks about why it is that so many people love so very much: the hero’s journey, the fish out of water thing, the wish fulfillment thing (very deliberately not using the word ‘escapism’ here), Harry’s dual role as an Everyman and as The Chosen One, etc. But something that I never really hear people point to in this context is J.K. Rowling’s voice as an author. This is especially astounding to me not only because it’s the very first thing that drew me to this book, but also because it seems to me that her voice is what holds the rest of it together — all those other lovely, constantly shifting pieces of word and story. Right from the very first sentence of the very first chapter of the very first book, it’s obvious:

Even as a thirteen year old, this seemed different to me than the usual stuff I read. It was polite yet sassy. It was saying things that were maybe a bit over my head, things about being an adult, but which nonetheless were amusing and stuck with me. Every time that I’ve read it since, though it’s read a bit differently to me each time, it’s never failed to suck me in, to the point where if I accidentally pick the book up and read the first sentence, it’s often not until I reach the end of the chapter that I realize I’m still reading. I have done this on multiple occasions (including the first time I read the book — I found it abandoned on the floor of my sister’s room, picked it up, read the first chapter, and then stole it from her; I still don’t think she realizes I ever did that) . And the way she introduces the Dursleys! Uncle Vernon with his thick beefy neck, Aunt Petunia with her long skinny one, and both of them caring way too much about what other people think of them.

I have always loved that our first glimpse of Harry’s world is through the eyes of his aggressively normal Muggle relations, particularly the expansive Vernon Dursley. We know from later books (more on this in a bit) that while Petunia may certainly pretend a hatred and ignorance of the Wizarding World, she’s not exactly what she appears. But Vernon — yeah, it’s pretty much all on the surface with him. He kisses his priggish wife and chubby son goodbye, and then he spends the rest of his day alternately missing signs of the wonderful that occur practically under his nose, and pushing those he does see under the dusty rug in his brain that is reserved for Things That Cannot Be (“the get-ups you saw on young people!”). But cats reading maps, owls fluttering all over the place, people in cloaks, a whisper of the Potters . . . and then this:

For as much as Vernon Dursley doesn’t approve of imagination, he sure does use it a lot — mostly to pretend things. In fact, both of the Dursleys are champion pretenders, pretending being the main way they get though their days. They pretend Petunia doesn’t have a sister named Lily, who was a witch who went away to Witch and Wizard school and who married a wizard; Vernon pretends here that nothing odd is going on around him, squashing down reality into little bite-sized pieces until it fits into his preconceived notion of What The World Should Be, until he can once again believe that he lives in a world where everyone is just like him. (I’m also thinking of an incident from the beginning of Chamber of Secrets when the Dursleys force Harry to stay shut away in his bedroom “pretending he’s not there” — this could actually describe their entire relationship with him, but there it’s just made more explicit than usual).

Even though I think Mr. and Mrs. Dursley are very entertaining on their own, all that excessive Dursleyishness makes what happens next seem all the more wonderful. After Vernon has finally manage to fall asleep, we meet Albus Dumbledore, who “didn’t seem to realise* that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome.” Dumbledore is the living embodiment of everything the Dursleys work so hard pretending doesn’t exist. As soon as he puts out all the lights on Privet Drive with his ‘Put-Outer,’ we forget all about the Dursleys. And then the cat who’s been sitting on a wall all day, reading maps and upsetting Mr. Dursley with it’s non-cat behavior, turns into a severe looking woman who Dumbledore greets warmly. (“How did you know it was me?” “My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”) The interaction that follows does a lot of heavy lifting in a short amount of time. By the time it’s over and everyone except Harry has left Privet Drive, we may not know exactly the details of their lives, but we do know exactly what kind of people they are, and we’ve barely met them.

We also learn the bare bones version of Harry’s story: that the reason owls have been flying around all day and people in strange cloaks ruined Mr. Dursley’s day is that someone called Voldemort has — unbelievably! — gone from the world, that Voldemort was unspeakably evil (to the point where people are reluctant to speak his name), and that according to McGonagall, Dumbledore is the only wizard Voldemort ever feared (“You flatter me . . . Voldemort had powers I’ll never have.” “Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.”) We learn all of this in an organic fashion, piecing together the bits and pieces of McGonagall and Dumbledore’s, and later, Hagrid’s, conversation. She eases us into the story without resorting to clunky exposition. This is exactly how these characters would talk if this had really happened (WHICH OF COURSE IT DID). We get just enough information to understand what’s going on, and to tempt us to read further to find out more.

But the meat of their conversation isn’t in the veiled clues about Voldemort and Harry, or even the Wizarding World, it’s in the deep human emotions that these people display even from the very first chapter. It’s these same deeply felt emotions that clue us in to their characters:

While everyone else was out celebrating, McGonagall — who has to be the most stubborn, immovable woman I’ve ever read about — waited all day to hear news that was only going to devastate her. She is fierce and hard and very contained, and yet she feels things very deeply. It’s a really nice touch that when she starts asking Dumbledore about the rumors, that Lily and James Potter are dead, that Voldemort tried to kill Harry and failed, he can only bow his head. That he was only moments before yammering on about sherbet lemons makes his lack of words here even more notable. There’s real grief under there, grief he doesn’t have the words for at the moment, grief perhaps he doesn’t want to feel quite yet, and so he talks of Muggle sweets and scars shaped like the London Underground. And that’s Dumbledore’s character in a nutshell. Eccentric and kind on the outside, dark and unknowable on the inside. And then there’s Hagrid, a giant of a man who shows up on a flying motorbike with a sleeping baby Harry wrapped up in a blanket. Hagrid, wild and hairy, who gives baby Harry a big whiskery kiss before letting “out a howl like a wounded dog” at the thought of leaving him there. Hagrid, who McGonagall questions, but of whom Dumbledore says, “I would trust hagrid with my life.” (This statements tells us two things: 1) That Hagrid and his appearance are strange even in the world these people come from, and 2) that Dumbledore is the kind of man who places his trust in people the general world mislikes.)

[For the rest of Chapter One and for Chapter Two, .)"
724,725,5,"Hufflepuff 20th Anniversary Editions







I fell in love with the gorgeous new house editions of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone the minute I saw them but I promised myself I'd only buy the two Hufflepuff ones because lets face it who really needs 13 copies of one book (I already own a paperback, hardback, ebook and audiobook plus the illustrated edition!). Well my resolve lasted all of one day because the minute my Hufflepuff ones arrived they were so beautiful that I just HAD to have the set!





Yes, I'm a total Potterhead but I'm not even sorry - just look at them! They were too pretty for my own good! The hardbacks are totally stunning but I love the bright covers on the paperbacks too. Both versions of the books contain the same extra content (although each house is different) so if you bought a set of either the hardbacks or the paperbacks you'd get all the extra material available.

Each edition has the house crest on the front and again inside with a list of the house attributes (dedication, patience and loyalty in the case of Hufflepuff) and then includes background information on the house and it's founder, proud house moments, details of the house relic, livery and ghost, a black and white portrait of the founder and a map of Hogwarts. Then there is the full version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone followed by some more additional information at the back of the book about the Sorting Ceremony, the House common room, memorable students and alumni, the current Head of House and the House Cup. I think most (if not all) of this information is probably already available on the  but I like having it all in one place.

I can't believe it's been 20 years since Philosopher's Stone was first published but these books are a beautiful way to commemorate the occasion!



________________________



To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Bloomsbury UK are publishing 8 brand new editions of the book with gorgeous new covers inspired by the four Hogwarts houses.

The hardback versions are black with colourful crests and sprayed edges to match the house scarves:



While the paperbacks are much brighter with a black house crest and edges sprayed in a single colour:



Aren't they beautiful? I honestly can't decide whether I like the hardback or paperback versions more and I'm seriously tempted to add all 8 versions to my wish list but I just can't justify buying 8 more copies of a book I already own five times LOL.

I have to show my House Pride and buy the Hufflepuff versions though! I mean, just look how pretty they are!



Who else is going to be buying the new versions? Which House are you a member of?"
725,726,5,"5/5⭐️

Al principio, conocemos a la ""familia"" de Harry, sus tíos y primo, con los que vive y es imposible no odiarlos. A partir del momento en que Harry conoce a Hagrid, me fue imposible soltar el libro. Conforme vamos adentrándonos más en el mundo mágico, conociendo profesores, compañeros y criaturas fantásticas la trama te engancha completamente.
Al terminar, me he sorprendido por la cantidad de cosas que han sucedido en tan pocas páginas, aunque esto debemos atribuirlo a la facilidad de Harry para meterse en problemas.
En conclusión, un libro mágico, lleno de aventuras, que no decae en ningún momento y nos abre las puertas a un mundo e historia asombrosos.

Como dato, yo me he leído la edición que celebra el 20 aniversario de publicación de este libro, el de Slytherin, ya que es mi casa. Debo decir que toda la información que te dan tanto al principio como al final es increíble."
726,727,5,"Pročitala sam ovo svojoj bebi od 4 mjeseca and I loved every minute of it.
Treći put čitam i zadivljena sam nanovo, posebno time kako je J. K. R. uspjela u 260 stranica stvoriti tako divan svijet.
A sad da kažem nekoliko riječi:
lavabo
škafiškafnjak

Ostatak ću ipak sama pročitati inače nećemo završiti do njene 15. godine :')"
727,728,5,Still love it
728,729,5,"I was hooked from the first chapter: a whole new world and Rowling drew me in, had me believing this strange underground magical society. The book holds the winning formula for a great children's story: good writing, a likable/relatable protagonist, an evil antagonist (several actually), the funny side kick (sadly I did not appreciate the full comic relief of Ron until Rupert Grint's excellent interpretation on film), the brain, the ignorant rival, the complications of relationships, even intriguing minor ones, the quest, and of course good conquering in the end.

I admire Rowling's appreciation of her position of role model. She encourages education, morality, good will and humanity, and fairly clean vocabulary (and only mild swearing by the 17-year-olds) instead of resulting to cheap trips to sell books. In light of the entire series, it amazes me how complex even the first book is without you even realizing it. I have never come across such a detailed imagination and coupled with an ability to write and draw the reader in, it is no wonder the series has been so explosive and returned children to the passion of reading. JK Rowling is my idol.

If for some reason you live under a rock or are resisting the mass media appeal of this book, please give it a try. Don't judge us Harry Potter fanatics by the first book. And never judge us by the movies. Having said that, I don't know how I would read this book if I picked it up post fandom. It come with huge expectations so you almost want it to fail. In book one, you can hardly see why it has become so well loved. When I read this book, I liked the story enough to continue, was a moderate fan by four, but didn't consider myself a die-hard Harry Potter fan until I completed book six and caught a glimpse of her vision. Some of the best fiction I have ever read; it's worth the read.

In this book you are reading the carefree story of an ordinary boy about to embark on an amazing adventure in an undiscovered world. It is fun, enjoyable, and every boy's dream. Although this book is intended for eleven year olds, it has way more adult appeal than any other juvenile fiction I've ever read. But that's not what the story is really about. When you get to the end of the series, come back and read it again. Now it is the story of a loving headmaster with the difficult task of preparing an innocent boy for every level of sorrow until he must make the ultimate act of bravery. Now you can read it as an adult. How a simple story can be two completely different novels is impressive and shows the depth of the story."
729,730,5,"AHHH SO MANY EMOTIONS PACKED IN ONE TINY BOOK.
This is my first time ever re-reading the HP books and I'm so happy I did it! I listened to the audiobook this time around because I didn't have much time and it was my first time ever listening to an audiobook and I absolutely loved the experience. I think there are only a few select books that audiobooks are appropriate for and Harry Potter is definitely one of them. It took me back to the days where my dad would read to me and my sister before putting us to bed.

I absolutely loved reading the books after the movie has been released because it allowed us to envision the scenes more vividly with every detail. One thing JK Rowling did a fantastic job at with the books is that she had planned and prepared and imagined the wizarding world down to every detail to the point that she made it a point to list all the textbooks with their authors, the different candies and chocolates, the history of the wizarding world, and DESCRIPTION OF THE FOOD OH MY GOODNESS.

This book was written so well and is suitable for all ages and for that and other reasons, I cannot give this book any less than 5 stars <3

SPOILER ALERT (though, if you still don't know the storyline of the books, you REALLLY need to read the books or even watch the movies)

And rereading it after fully understanding the story has made me realized that Dumbledore had probably known all along and was pushing for Harry to come face to face with Voldy and I mean, for an 11 year old that's a BIG responsibility. Poor kid. To credit Harry, Ron and Hermione, they HAD tried seeking for an adult's help but they all ignored them so what choice did they have. AND HAHA Dumbledore just does whatever the heck he wants man. I mean at the end when they were announcing the winner of the house cup he was just like ""Nah, yknw what I don't want Slytherin to win, lemme just let them THINK they won but then give extra points to Gryffindor for breaking all the school rules weeee""

I think the movies didn't quite portray alot of the characters properly.
For one, Harry is sassy okay. SASSY
2. Dumbledore is supposed to be a little more loopy and weird
3. Hagrid is supposed to be more protective of everything he believes in like Harry, Dumbledore, etc
and finally, WHY THE HECK DIDN'T FRED AND GEORGE MAKE MORE APPEARANCES IN THE MOVIE?!?"
730,731,5,"Third Read: January 4-6, 2023 | 4 stars
Before getting into this review, I just want to mention that there is something to be said about separating art from its artist. That is all.

This was wonderful, as to be expected. It is truly a comfort read, like a warm hug, despite it not holding the same nostalgia as it does for many other readers. I first read this book as a petty middle schooler who finally gave into my Harry Potter crazed friend group who had been begging me to read it for years (hence why I gave it a 4.9 star rating the first time I read it, lol).

This third time around I think I came into this with a bit more of an objective lens. It is still great, but feels a bit formulaic. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, in fact, I think Harry Potter actually shines in it's formulaic approach, however, something about it just didn't make me want to give it 5 stars. It's just a feeling I got for it, okay?

Take note that I don't feel the nostalgia like everyone else. A second reason for this might not hold the same magic is because I am surprisingly familiar with this story considering I've only actively consumed it three times before it (I read the book twice, and read the movie once), and that was almost 7 years ago! I surprise myself sometimes.

I am more than excited to continue on with the series this year - this year is the year I finish it! Thanks Aidan for the push <3 I look forward to playing my board game and watching your presentation about how great I am!


Sometimes a book just feels like a 5 star read even though objectively it wasn't perfect. And that's how I feel about this one. Plus I keep reading 2 star books that looking back on this one it makes me want to rate it higher. Sue me.

| 5 stars
How could I not give this 5 stars? <3 <3

| 5 stars
4.9 stars..."
731,732,5,"This year marks the 20th anniversary of the very first Harry Potter book so special editions have been released and of course I pre-ordered them months ago.

The story is the original one that we all know about. No amendments there, which is largely due to the fact that we experience stuff from Harry's POV so we only get to see certain common rooms at certain moments in the story.
Therefore, I'd like to conentrate on the extra content in each version as well as the GORGEOUS illustrations:
Every book has the respective house crest with the three characteristics in the beginning, followed by the individual chapters, in this case:
- Slytherin: An Introduction
- Making Slytherin Proud
- House Founder: Salazar Slytherin
- House Relic
- House Livery
- House Ghost
Then comes the actual story, followed by:
- The Sorting
- Hogwarts Quiz
- House Common Room
- Memorable Slytherin Students
- Famous Slytherin Alumni
- Head of Slytherin House
- The House Cup
- J.K. Rowling, Twenty Years of Magic

Moreover, each book also has a pretty map of Hogwarts and its grounds:

Throughout the book, there are various illustrations unique to the respective house (of the house ghost, founder or head of house etc) by Levi Pinfold, which is really giving this an extra edge (just like the sprayed edges that are like the house livery).

The crests on the dust jackets are especially nice because of the contrast, which is why I decided t get the hardcovers and not the paperbacks.

It's a little bit of a cheat since I didn't re-read the entire book (especially not 4 times) but concentrated on the extra content and illustration, but although I knew the extra content from the early days of Pottermore, I still enjoyed this very much."
732,733,5,"This my first time rereading this book in four years and it is just as magical and brilliant as I remembered.
The artwork by Jim Kay is absolutely beautiful and it's so exciting to see the world we know and love re-imagined! I can't wait to see the rest of the series illustrated.
This time reading it I found myself feeling a lot more emotional about Harry and his life. He is so young! I feel so sorry for him and angry that he was left to have an awful upbringing by the magical world. Whereas when I read it multiple times as a child I was mainly just excited about the magic.
The world building in this book is absolutely phenomenal and it's just amazing the way that JK Rowling manages to create such a believable and detailed magical system that fits in with the world we know. This time reading it I was happy to notice more of the references to the real world that went completely over my head when I was younger.
I love reading about the blossoming friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione and it's so great to read about Harry finally finding a place he can call home.
I can't help but see Dumbeldore as being very manipulative from the start, so it's interesting to read about him with a new perspective. I also just can't bring myself to like Snape, nothing excuses someone being so horrible to wee children!

This isn't the best review because this book is just perfect and I can hardly even put into world everything I love about this book!"
733,734,5,"Neizmerno me raduje što mi godine distance i činjenica da radnju Kamena mudrosti znam pa... napamet, računajući tu i neke replike, nisu pokvarile uživanje u čitanju. Oduševio mi je jezik, koji je istovremeno prilagođen deci i izuzetno slikovit i efektan. Sve su to slojevi na koje kao mlađa čitateljka čitajući prevod nisam u toj meri obraćala pažnju. Još jedan uspeo aspekt je svakako karakterizacija likova na način da pomoću nekoliko upečatljivih detalja svaki lik dobija svoj jedinstveni karakter, tako da ih je zaista nemoguće pomešati, čak i kada se radi o manje bitnim likovima. To je nešto što sam primetila da nedostaje nekim novijim delima iz istog žanra i posebno je frustrirajuće kada se na desetak stranica sretnemo s 15 likova i svi su isti.

Ne mogu da kažem da mi je to što sam unapred znala ko su good a ko bad guys kvarilo zabavu, ali jeste oduzelo na uzbuđenju. Jedva čekam da vidim kakav će mi biti utisak posle kasnijih nastavaka, kojih se ipak manje sećam, s obzirom na to, ali i na tužnu istinu da je Rouling u nekom trenutku počela da se... khm... gubi.

P.S. Teška srca priznajem da me je na momente politički nekorektan humor prilično uveseljavao. Nisam sigurna da bi neki detalji tek tako nezapaženo prošli da je u pitanju izdanje novijeg datuma."

Credo che siano state spese abbastanza parole, da così tanta gente che una mia recensione non possa servire più di tanto. E so di non essere l'unica a pensarla così, perchè sono innumerevoli le recensione che iniziano esattamente come questa. Lascio che siano persone molto più eloquenti a cercare di descrive cosa abbia significato e ancora significhi questa saga per me e per innumerevoli miei coetanei e non. Ma! So di voler dire almeno due cose:

1. Questa edizione è superlativa. Non mi ricordo chi per primo ho sentito dire che leggere HP in questo nuovo formato è come rileggerlo per la prima volta, ma sono d'accordo. Mi sono sentita di nuovo bambina a sfogliare le pagine senza considerare quello che so già accadrà nei prossimi libri.

2. Altro motivo per cui mi sembra di avere di nuovo sei anni o giù di lì: voglio il prossimo!!! Sul serio, li avrò letti tutti quanti almeno tre volte, ma ora come ora non vedo l'ora che esca il secondo, e so che sarà così ogni volta che avrò finito di leggere uno dei volumi.

E poi, c'è un modo migliore di iniziare l'anno che con la lettura di HP? Ovviamente no.."

“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”
When I think of J.K. Rowling or Harry Potter, I think of magic. The magic of words, the magic of imagination. Harry Potter was my first introduction to fantasy, and what an awesome one it was. There is nothing better than reading about good vs evil, and the journey good has to take to defeat evil.
It confounds me that this book was submitted to twelve, , publishing houses, which rejected it. And now this author is a millionaire, and the Harry Potter series famous."
736,737,5,"One of my vague (not particularly committed, I had failed plenty of times before) 2023 reading resolutions was to try to listen to an audiobook again. Something which most readers find enjoyable and sometimes preferable and which seemingly EVERYBODY did effortlessly and it had never clicked for me. So I have it another try, set myself up for success by stacking the decks with this recommendation (I forgot exactly from whom but it was just right though I suspect it will be all downhill from Stephen Fry reading Harry Potter, really...), and set up right circumstances (I got my first earbuds as a present, I was missing cardio endorphins very much) and how it worked, I listened to my first audiobook and enjoyed it very much. Take that 2023!

I am probably not ready, if I ever will be, to actually hear audiobooks of books I have not read. My attention still wavers, I do not understand names and I relate to the info a lot differently, forget things I heard just 30 seconds ago. But for this, remembered but not totally it was so very good.

It is a very very good middle grade (if it is that! The vocabulary!) book, with fantastic plotting. Very funny very often also. I am getting quite critical of Dumbledore as headmaster really...

Illustrated editions of HP #1 - #3! Yaaay!

I'm currently reading GoF, but I guess I'm going to read 2 HP books at the same time! Re-read within a re-read! I'm mad, I know :D

~ ~ ~

I've not written a review for any of the Harry Potter books so far and I've read them more than a dozen times! (forget the count on GR, I've been reading and rereading HP longer long before I've started properly updating GR). I remember reading the entire Harry Potter series on a 3.5 inch Nokia phone with a keypad, so a very small screen. And I've probably read it 5-6 times on that little screen. Later I've read it on larger screen phones until I finally bought the box set. It was amazing, to finally buy the physical copies of the books.

Now, I'm getting the illustrated editions of the first 3 books in a day, I'm giddy and excited AF like a kid! I can't wait to see the illustrations. I think this will be the first time I'm going to stop reading HP series in the middle to start over again. Never old enough to be a fanboy!!!"
738,739,5,"I had written a full review for this book but it has disappeared. =o(

What I can say is that I was pulled straight in to a whole new world of magic, a brilliant school for young wizards and witches. Amazing creatures I could picture in detail. Teachers who are not unlike the usual school scenes but with a magical twist. And harrowing adventures of three young teens who form an unlikely friendship, soon to help each other to the end, no matter what the end may be!

It's not hard to understand why became a worldwide sensation!
This is the second time I've read this book as I had finished it and the second before it went flying off the shelves. Surprisingly, I haven't read beyond the fourth year so I wanted to reread them from the beginning. I'm very glad I did as I enjoyed it as much or maybe more than I did the first go around! Like most everyone else, I love this series!"

Teach us something please,
Whether we be old and bald,
Or young with scabby knees,
Our heads could do with filling
With some interesting stuff,
For now they're bare and full of air,
Dead flies and bits of fluff,
So teach us something worth knowing,
Bring us back what we've forgot,
Just do your best, we'll do the rest,
And learn until our brains all rot...”


Jumping into the magical Wizarding World of with high expectations and did not disappoint. The first book of the series was fun to read and it is so perfect that it is too hard to describe it. Also growing up watching Harry Potter series was the best thing that ever happened. I love each and everything about it the school of Hogwarts, quidditch and of course the trio of Harry, Ron and Hermoine.

I just can’t wait to read the rest of the series :)"

”It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live”

I really enjoyed this reread! The one and only gripe I had when I read it in English for the first time was how hard it was to understand Hagrid but for some reason that didn’t bother me at all this time around.
There’ll always be a special place in my heart for the Harry Potter series, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.

ok believe me when I say not giving this book five stars hurts my soul. but since it's my first time reading it in english all the hagrid dialogue made it sooooo difficult to read i love him but oh my god what is grammar.
anyway, i love it."
741,742,5,"Loved this even more the second time around than the first! This was such a fun re-read! I loved this book! I loved the friendship that Harry, Ron, and Hermione share. This book was full of action, mystery, magic, and wizardry! I loved the storyline and the world building, the characters of the story, and the whole wizard school atmosphere! This book is about a boy who learns he is a wizard and goes to wizard school at Hogwarts. He also meets the evil Voldemort who killed his parents for the first time in this book. This is going to be a great series! I would definitely recommend this read!"

Minulla on leffamaratooni menossa Pottereista tällä hetkellä ja ah, nämä kirjat ovat vain niin paljon parempia (leffatkin ovat hyvin tehty ja olen niidenkin fani, mutta kaikki ketkä ovat nämä lukeneet tietävät mitä tarkoitan). Rakastan sitä miten kirjoissa Rowlingin taikamaailmaan pääsee uppoutumaan. Rakastan jokaista pientä yksityiskohtaa Tylypahkasta. Pelkkää rakkautta siis.

It was absolutely beautiful and I found myself taking long breaks to just really examine some of the full pages illustrations. It took me three nights of nighttime reading to finish it up and it was kind of a surprise how quickly it went by? I guess I always forget how smooth and short this first book is. As much as I enjoy our first look at Hogwarts and our introduction to Harry, this is still one of my least favorites in the series. The big showdown at the end happens too quickly and it's a fade to black. MEH.

So I love the movies, and remember loving the hell out of the books, yes, even though I didn't get all the things happening due to missing parts of books I skipped. Oopsie.

Yes, I am a grown person still preferring children and young adult books over most of the books ""for grown-ups"".

July 25, 2015

So this was my very first time reading Harry Potter.
I know, I know. I have no idea how I've managed to go this long without ever reading it. I grew up watching and loving the movies, but this was better. I was a little hesitant to pick this up, afraid I wasn't going to love it as much as I was hoping to. I'm so glad I read this now. I really, really loved it. And I can't wait to read the rest of the series very soon."
748,749,5,"para mi, como para mucha gente mas, harry potter significa muchísimo porque fue mi primera lectura, el libro que me hizo amar la literatura. hoy en dia hay mucha controversia con la escritora y se que mucha gente esta en contra de ella hoy en día, pero a mi Jk rowling me regalo mi infancia. Para mi este libro es volver a mi lugar seguro, es volver a la primaria a las horas de matematica donde me la pasaba leyendo los libros de esta saga. digan lo que quieran pero pocos libros lograron lo que se logro con harry potter"
749,750,5,"So this is me reading Harry Potter for the first time at 23. I loved it but I can't help thinking how much more it would have meant to me had I read it while growing up. It did still give me a sense of nostalgia because I have a lot of people around me who grew up reading the books and watching the movies and well, if you're on any social media you can't really escape the references. It's still very exciting jumping into such a vast universe despite being quite a few years late to the party!

P.S. This might be exactly what I need to get back into reading."
750,751,5,"This book was the book that taught me that words were powerful and that mastering them was an art form.

J.K Rowling sets up the magical world of Harry Potter in less than 300 pages. The story is fantastic and the pacing flows like a well-established rhythm. There's magic, love, friendship, mystery, horror, drama, comedy... you named it."

¿Qué decir que no se haya dicho ya en miles de reseñas? Gracias a este libro soy el lector que soy ahora. Porque me animó a descubrir cientos de otras historias que pudieran llenar el vació que dejó esta saga. Releerla casi 7 años después de mi primera lectura es nostálgico y hermoso al mismo tiempo.

El enorme impacto que tuvieron estos personajes, con los que me pude identificar. Personajes en los que me pude ver reflejado y que hasta la fecha llevo en mi corazón. Es increíble como la autora logra que conectemos con estos y que sea una historia, a pesar de que es infantil, sea inigualable.

La forma en la que está escrito el libro hace que se lea súper rápido, pero más que eso, me la pasé diciendo “Awwww” toda la lectura. Recuerdo muy tangiblemente todo lo que sentí en su primera lectura. Descubrir el Mundo Mágico para mí fue hallar la puerta a cientos de otros libros, sin los que ahora no viviría.

Leer, para mí, es más que solo . Es básicamente, lo mejor que me ha pasado. Haber descubierto Harry Potter fue, básicamente un hecho que cambió por completo mi vida. Es increíble como esta saga nos marcó a tantas personas y a mí me llevó a leer todo lo que leo ahora.

Como han podido leer, amo la saga de Harry Potter como producto, y sus libros me marcaron la vida entera, pero no puedo dejar de mencionar la gran polémica alrededor de su figura. La postura de J.K. Rowling con respecto a la comunidad Transgénero es transfóbica y tóxica. Que J.K. Rowling sea una TERF es inaceptable, y es triste que una persona que nos enseñó tantas cosas en sus libros tenga posturas ignorantes como esta.

Ahora, es importante separar la obra de su autor, y es algo que a mí me costó para poder seguir amando Harry Potter y no a la autora. Yo no seguiré leyendo los próximos libros de J.K. Rowling, pero no dejar de querer y de leer la historia de Harry Potter por esto. ¿Por qué estoy diciendo todo esto? Porque, créanlo o no, alguien me escribió por mensaje directo en mi Instagram a decirme que era transfobo por releer Harry Potter después de tanto tiempo.

Quiero dejar claro que releyendo la saga, porque más allá de ser uno de mis libros favoritos, es básicamente el libro que lo inició todo para mí. Por favor, quiero volver a disfrutar de esta saga y no quiero entrar en peleas inútiles sobre cosas que son derechos humanos básicos y sobre cosas que respeto, acepto y apoyo.

Se despide MontFort.

What to say that has not already been said in thousands of reviews? Thanks to this book, I am the reader that I am now. Because it encouraged me to discover hundreds of other stories that could fill the void left by this saga. Rereading it almost 7 years after my first reading is nostalgic and beautiful at the same time.

The enormous impact that these characters had, with whom I could identify. Characters in which I could see myself reflected and that to date I carry in my heart. It is incredible how the author manages to connect us with these and make it a story, even though it is childish, it is unmatched.

The way the book is written makes it read super-fast, but more than that, I kept saying “Awwww” the entire reading. I remember very tangibly everything that I felt in your first reading. Discovering the Magical World for me was finding the door to hundreds of other books, without which I would not live now.

Reading, for me, is more than just . It's basically the best thing that ever happened to me. Discovering Harry Potter was basically a life-changing event. It is incredible how this saga marked so many people and led me to read everything I read now.

As you have been able to read, I love the Harry Potter saga as a product, and this books marked my entire life, but I cannot fail to mention the controversy surrounding the author. J.K. Rowling regarding the Transgender community is transphobic and toxic. That J.K. Rowling being a TERF is unacceptable, and it's sad that a person who taught us so much in her books has ignorant positions like this.

Now, it is important to separate the author's work from the author itself, and it is something that cost me to continue loving Harry Potter and not the author. I will not continue reading the next books by J.K. Rowling, but I stop loving and reading the Harry Potter story for this. Why am I saying all this? Because, believe it or not, someone wrote to me via DM on my Instagram to tell me that I was transphobic for rereading Harry Potter after so long.

I want to make it clear that rereading the saga, because beyond being one of my favorite books, it is basically the book that started it all for me. Please, I want to enjoy this series again, and I don’t want to get into pointless fights about things that are basic human rights and about things that I respect, accept and support.

MontFort says bye.

787,788,5,"“…there will be books written about Harry--every child in our would will know his name.”

I wonder if J.K. Rowling knew when she was writing this just how true in a sense that was going to be—that pretty much every child and every adult in our world too would know his name and hers too!

This is not really a review of the book as much as it is going to be gush gush gush about the really gorgeous illustrated edition which I just acquired, and of course promptly read. is in some ways my favourite in the series. I love the first introduction to the magical world, to witches and wizards, to platform 9 and 3/4ths, to Hogwarts, lessons, games, feasts and adventures. It is also probably the least dark of the series, despite having touches of it, and I love reading the story and watching the film, both of which I’ve done countless times (the film many more times than the book since the rerun it so often).

The Jim Kay illustrated edition was something I’ve been debating buying for a while but I finally did decide to get it (the good discount being offered helped). This is such a gorgeous book from cover to cover. The illustration of Hogwarts on the front and back inner covers, those of the characters, of the creatures including Fluffy the three headed dog, the ghosts, even the double page illustration from (I guess, the illustrated) Fantastic Beasts on trolls was wonderful. I loved the little touches like ink blots on the non-illustrated pages—these also have different colours and shading. My favourite was the purple and black fire page. The start page of each chapter also has lovely illustrated backgrounds for the chapter title. Reading this edition doubled my enjoyment of the book, and I am looking forward to buying the rest of the set. The only point that worries me is this, one of the thinner ones in the series is pretty heavy, and though I managed to read it (even sitting up in bed), and will manage the same for the first three, I don’t know how this will work out for the later books in the series which grow larger and thus heavier. But that won’t be stopping me from getting copies all the same when they’re out!"

Okay I know it's like the biggest crime in the book community to not have read the Harry Potter series but better late than never am I right! The Philosopher's Stone was such a nice first book in this fantasy world. It doesn't dump too much information on you and doesn't answer all of harry's/our questions right off the bat so it keeps you in suspense. While reading this book I got the same feeling of reading the Percy Jackson series for the first time when I was 12, I was never bored once and the main trio are all so lovable. Harry is much more sarcastic than I expected him to be! He has no problem letting someone know he has a problem with them. My little prodigy can bite!



I love Hermione so much she's just as fabulous as everyone says, WHEN SHE TACKLED SNAPE TO THE GROUND YESSS GIRL! she's beauty she's kind she'll put you in a full body bind! You guys should know that redheads are my favorite. I'm so glad Ron exists in this world and better yet that I finally have the chance to see him steadily progress. This boy didn't hesitate to back up Harry in a duel and that's so rad of him, okay sure he knew it was going to be a fake duel but I know he would have done the same if it was real...



Oh my god do I cherish neville longbottom <3 He's so precious. I wanted to wrap him up and make him hot chocolate. Draco is the typical villain as of now but I'm really interested in him. I hope he gets more depth. Now I've decided that I'm going to buy/read one Harry Potter book per month so I don't destroy my bank account anasinakanl. I'm weak af so I hope I don't break since it's barley the 7th and all I want to do is get the next book ;a;"
789,790,5,"""Wait, you still love this series? After all this time?""

""Always.""

Happy 20th anniversary to this great series. Rereading it brought so many memories. I also got so many different feelings from my initial reading. Now that I know the ending, I read some lines differently. Like when Aunt Petunia talked about Lily:







When I read it back then, I thought it was there just to show how much Aunt Petunia hated Harry's mom and made readers becoming more sympathetic to Harry. But, I guess the emotion is more complicated than that, considering the relationship between the two sisters that was unfolded in later books.

The first meeting between Snape and Harry also looked different now.



What seem to be a normal question in a class turned to be something different

I do have several ""grown-up"" attention to some parts, like: couldn't they have a better system than going through a wall in platform 9 3/4? I mean, you can't see the other side. Wouldn't that be dangerous? You might hit someone when you're crossing. Another one would be: why the heck the school sent 4 students to the Forbidden Forest as a detention? That's a dangerous place. Yes, they were with Hagrid (who later sent two students and a dog alone through a forest, looking for whatever thing that killed a unicorn), but it still didn't make sense to me.

Overall, this was still a fun ride. I still enjoy this book and want to read the entire series once again."

Тази книга няма нужда от представяне, няма нужда да ви разказвам историята, предполагам аз съм един от малкото хора, които за първи път попадат в този магичен свят.
❄️
Моята история с книгата започна, когато бях на около 14 години. В това време прочитах по книга на година и баба реши да ми подари ""Хари Потър и философският камък"". Тя, обаче, предпочете да я прочете първа преди да ми я даде и разбира се, не я хареса, защото обикновено чете езотерика и е от тези хора, които нямат никакво въображение. (Скрудж) Аз й имах голямо доверие и си казах, значи няма смисъл и аз да я чета. (глупаво дете)
❄️
Години наред, някак си бях самоналожила,че тази книга е детска, че не е за мен, колкото и приятели да ми я препоръчваха, аз отказвах дори да я започна.
❄️
Един прекрасен ден, наскоро, реших да и дам шанс.
❄️
Първо изгледах филмите и неочаквано за мен се влюбих, в света, в персонажите, ревах с пълно гърло при загубата на Доби, Сириус... Бях, като блъсната с лопата, когато накрая всъшност разбрах за Снейп, (а в последните филми почти го бях намразила. )
❄️
Изгледах филмите, не исках да свършват и си казах, че веднага започвам да чета книгите.
❄️
Първа книга, почти нямаше разлики от филма, беше толкова магична и сладка. Всъщност, осъзнах, че книгага далеч не е детска и има толкова моменти със скрит смисъл, ако само се замислиш, можеш да си извадиш доста поука.
❄️
Влюбих се в персонажите, някак след края, те ми липсват и искам още от техните истории. Обожавам Хагрид, той ми е абсолютен фаворит. Света е, може би, най - великият, в който съм попадала. Това не е просто преживяване с книга, това е истинско вълшебство, което остава белег в съзнанието ти, от онези книги, които казваш, че са ти променили живота.
❄️
Радвам се, ама страшно много, че уцелих, да прочета книгага, точно сега, през зимния и празничен сезон, бях изгубила коледен дух тази година, но се върна, с пълна сила.
❄️
Пс: Ако все още някой се чуди като мен, започвайте книгата, няма да съжелявате нито за момент!"
791,792,5,"I'm not sure why I re-read this book, in particular.
I felt nostalgic and longing for these characters, this story, this world.
I needed to feel at home again: Hogwarts.

I love everything about this series, every single character, plot line, magical creature. Harry is a vibrant protagonist, charismatic and unique. Ron and Hermione are the ideal best friends.
I don't know what else to say or write about this masterpiece of children/YA work, so I'm going to leave some quotes that I fell in love with during this re-read."
792,793,5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ five stars -

I LOVE this book!! Five glorious ALL THE STARS 🌟

I can’t believe I never reviewed this one 🤦‍♀️ I love it so much; this will be fun and easy to write ✍️

When this book was originally published in 1997, it caused such a sensation in the publishing world - there was so much buzz and excitement around this novel, it was really a fun, fun time.

This book was so hot, and it garnered so much publicity - it was the hot topic on the five o’clock news, it made the front page of the Entertainment section in your local newspaper, and it was continually mentioned on your local radio program. Everyone, everywhere was talking about it.

Amazon was still a baby, and this book dropped at just the right time - it created the perfect storm, and was a total shot in the arm the publishing world needed. Not to mention the fact that it got both sides of the pond reading again. It was truly a fun time in recent literary history.

This story is unique, easy to read, entertaining, addictive, heartwarming, and appeals to so many. Boy Wonder takes on evil? It’s a classic trope that was poised for success.

Unfathomable that an unknown author came out of nowhere, wrote this on a handful of serviettes in a cafe, and instantly became the Darling of the publishing world. Crazier things have rarely happened.

Anyone out there who has never read this book: go download a permanent copy for your Kindle. The movies ARE NOT the same. The depth of emotion, the complete story as Rowling intended can only be found between the pages of a book. Only inside the book can you explore the thoughts of the characters, feel their intense emotion, and catch subtle nuances of the plot crafted by a master storyteller.

Five solid gold stars for a twentieth century classic. An absolute must-read."
793,794,5,"Pocas sagas hay en el mundo de la literatura tan conocidas como Harry Potter. Y yo sin leerla… tenía que poner remedio. Empecé el libro algo escéptico, porque ni siquiera había visto las películas —en serio, aunque parezca imposible es cierto—, y la imagen que tenía de Harry en mi cabeza era algo mala —en parte por eso nunca le había dado una oportunidad— pero también contrastaba con cantidad de gente que conozco, de múltiples edades, para quienes tanto las sagas literarias como cinematográficas son de sus favoritas. Quizá el equivocado debía ser yo… y en efecto.

Este libro me ha traído multitud de emociones; todo el mundo sabemos, aunque sea por encima, de qué tratan estos libros, pero si no los has leído no tienes ni idea de qué sucede en realidad, como me pasaba a mí. Es un libro super entretenido, que te hace sentir de la peor forma posible cuando ves cómo tratan al pobre Harry «su familia»; y que drásticamente también te saca sonrisas cuando, de forma directa o indirecta, el chaval puede cobrarse una especie de venganza que pone en evidencia a esos pequeños hijos de Satán que tuvo la mala suerte de tener como parientes más próximos.

La moraleja que se puede sacar de este libro es muy importante y ayudará a muchos niños a enfrentar sus problemas con grandes dosis de positivismo; y es que por muy mal que te encuentres en un sitio, aunque te sientas fuera de lugar y te haga sentir terriblemente mal, seguro que hay otro sitio donde puedes ir, probablemente con una gente totalmente diferente, donde no sólo tendrás cabida y te sentirás como uno más, sino que quizá hasta puedas descubrir cualidades tuyas que hasta ese momento desconocías y podrías llegar a destacar sobre el resto.

¿Por qué no lo habré leído antes?"
794,795,5,"Ay! No me ha gustado el libro, ¡me ha encantando! Es la primera vez que leo Harry Potter, sí he visto todas las películas pero no más de dos veces, por lo que no recuerdo muy bien las cosas (por suerte) y eso me gusta ya que le da mucha más emoción a la lectura. Además que me han venido muchísimos recuerdos de cuando comenzó el “boom Harry Potter"", ¿tendría unos 10 años? Ay, una enana total! Sinceramente temía que no me gustará por ser demasiado juvenil para mi edad, pero estaba bien equivocada tanto que ahora estoy deseando seguir leyendo todos los libros para saber como sigue la historia.

En este primer libro lo que más me ha gustado es “ver"" como se va creando la amistad de Harry, Ron y Hermione. Conocer Hogwarts, las clases y sus profesores. Sentir la emoción de saber que guarda Fluffy en la trampilla. Reír con las locuras de Hagrid. La adrenalina de los partidos de Quidditch. Sentir miedo con Snape. Los sabios consejos de Dumbledore que es por ahora uno de mis personajes favoritos, sin contar a Harry, Ron y Hermione. Admito que no he podido aguantar las lagrimas en el final cuando están celebrando la fiesta de fin de curso y Dumbledore empieza hablar, ains. Lo dicho, muero de ganas por continuar leyendo...


Os dejo con dos citas de Dumbledore que me han tocado el corazoncito:

“No es bueno dejarse arrastrar por los sueños y olvidarse de vivir, recuérdalo.""
“Hay que tener un gran coraje para oponerse a nuestros enemigos, pero hace falta el mismo valor para hacerlo con los amigos.”"
795,796,5,"This book is truly special.

It's been a pretty rough year for me so far. My mental health issues and subsequent diagnosis really has taken it out of me. My only escape has been music and audiobooks. Books of the tree kind have been impossible to stick with - my mind just seems incapable of processing the words on the page. I've abandoned around 20 books this year and have found that really depressing.

So, my wife read these books about 5 years ago and was absolutely immersed and filled with joy the whole time she read them. I had picked the audiobooks up a couple of years ago and never listened to them. For some reason the time felt right.

My god, what did I miss out on as a child? I feel like I have picked up friends here in Harry, Ron and Hermione. Their adventures were exciting, fraught with danger and filled with positive messages - I loved it.

Stephen Fry is an incredible narrator and he bought this vibrant cast to life. I thought his reading of Snape to be particularly noteworthy. I know I am not adding anything new to the massive discussion that has been going on for nearly two decades now, but I just had to say . This books truly gave me joy during a time where joy has been in short supply. It's pretty sad when a grown man of 30 years is jealous of the friendships that come off the page - but I think that is part of Rowlings's talent as a writer.

I've rambled enough. This book is fantastic (did I mention that already?) and I can't wait to continue with the series."
796,797,5,"This was obviously the very first book in the series, and my very first introduction to Harry and Hermione and the rest of the characters.

I was in love at first sight.

I was appalled at the way he was treated by his Uncle and family.

I was so pleased by his rescue to the magical world that would soon become his life.

This was a very engaging read, that I also had the opportunity to share with my grandsons.

So much occurred with this introduction to Harry's new world.

Magic. The world of magic slowly builds itself as we read through the book.

It is fascinating, exciting, imaginative and creative.

Inspiration.

This book was an inspiration for readers to make dreams come true and bravely follow their dreams despite obstacles - because surely living with the Dursleys was an obstacle.

Good vs. Evil. Good vs evil is not a new concept, but upon learning the truth about what happened to his parents, Harry now can set a path to heroism.

I will say this though, the darkness that Rowling creates in her character Voldemort (he who shall not be named, who I named) is probably the creepiest villian I have ever read.

As readers, we are truly behind Harry all the way in finding how he can stop this evil.

Last thought. As a children's book, I am concerned about the darkness - of the evil described - but there are so many learning lessons throughout I believe readers should know what is best for them and their child when deciding to read this series.

And with this series, I did read it in order."
797,798,5,"Reading Harry Potter books always feels like coming home in a way, they've been a huge part of my life and I love returning to this world every single time. This time though, it's even better. The illustrated edition of the Philosopher's stone is simply gorgeous from the format of the book (big and square) to the truly beautiful illustrations by Jim Kay. They really add another dimension to the story.

Philosopher's stone was never my favourite Potter book but I still love it deeply. From first meeting the Dursleys (ew) to meeting Ron (Woop woop) and Hermione (Don't go looking for trolls). Just the feeling of slowly uncovering the world of magic in this book is very special and let's be honest all of us were dissapointed when that one letter did not arrive on your 11th birthday. Percy was just as annoying as I remembered and Hermione kept spewing her iconic one-liners (""it's win--dium levi--sa not levio- make the nice and long"" and ""we could have been killed or expelled""). Bless Hagrid's soul but it's probably not so clever to gamble for eggs from hooded figures, lesson learned I guess.

The colourful watercolour illustrations really do add life to the page especially the ones that cover a whole page or even a dual page spread are really cool. Even the small ones make the page more interesting in a good way.

Honestly it's just amazing and I love it what more needs to be said?"
798,799,5,"Wow, talk about being better the second time around! I just love J. K. Rowling, and I don't mind saying it. She became famous for creating a children's series, but please do not underestimate her talent. She is an extraordinarily imaginative writer. She creates a world that is out-of-this-world and yet, doesn't feel like it, does it? We know Harry's world so well.

My husband and I decided to do a Harry Potter reread and we are watching the films in between. I never finished the seventh book *gasp* and so I'll finally be finishing the series (hopefully) this year.

The first time I read this book, I enjoyed it but didn't love it. The second time around, it was so much better. First off, because I got a chance to listen to the wonderful Jim Dale's audio interpretation and secondly, because I bought the beautiful, hardback, full-color illustrated version of the book, and read that copy. What a wonderful experience, almost like waking up as a 5 year-old on Christmas morning.

Thank you, Jo Rowling. Your books leave me forever in your debt. I love them all. If I looked into the Mirror of Erised, I would see myself as a published writer of your caliber. Not for the fame or the money, but to have written a series of books that have had such a tremendously powerful impact on kids all over the world, including the kid in so many adults."
799,800,5,"This re-read was an amazing trip of nostalgia for me! I grew up reading this books, I grew up watching the movies and I grew up loving and discussing this whole universe. I don´t want to go into much detail with this review but I want to mention that the big advantage of this edition is that Jim Kay´s illustrations are much closer to J.K. Rowling´s descriptions than the movies are, so it was very interesting for me to be reminded how this whole wizardry world should look like. There are some parts in this book which still make me very emotional,
and many many more. So thank you J.K. Rowling for writing this series and thanks Jim Kay for adding these awesome pictures to it. If anyone of you haven´t read that book yet, than do so!

2020 UPDATE: Reading this book loudly to a friend who never been into Harry Potter was an amazing new experience! Now in retroperpective I find the quest within the forbidden forest with Hagrid very questionable but I adore the scene with the mirror Erised and I never been as obsessed with the centaurs like I was on this re-read!

801,802,5,"“Bye, Harry!”
“See you, Potter!”
“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him.
Hey Ron, of course he is still famous!
Usually when someone is born famous, he exploits his fame in not doing anything beneficial, or he does things with helping of his fame.
And mostly he will become greedy.
But this is not applicable on Harry, he was born famous but he didn't exploit his fame, he was humble, friendly and not greedy.
Everyone in his school had information about wizardry and magic more than him, but this didn't
desperate him, he didn't accept the fame without a good knowledge.
He decided to learn honestly to be worth of this fame.
He had many people that hated him because he was good boy.
Really it's so peculiar to see people hate good people!
He was born with love of adventures, he had a lot of them, he had lost sometimes but this didn't let him to give in, every time he had lost, he had kept going.
Harry taught me bravery in challenging the life, bravery in every work.

J.K Rowling, you are very great author, frankly I loved this magical world.
Consider me one of your admirers :)"

You're just never too old for Harry Potter, that's what I think. Seriously, this series was a part of my childhood/teenage-hood - I've read all the books and still working on seeing all the films. Rereading this, especially after a few years of not reading this, is like meeting up with an old friend and catching up with them.

Everything about this from start to finish is such a magical experience and you can easily immerse yourself in the wonders in which is known as Hogwarts. The plot is quite engaging and I also like how mysterious it can be - J.K Rowling is one of those authors that gets better by book in my opinion. Of course in a sense you can tell she's experimenting with the magical world/spells in the first book of the Harry Potter series, but nonetheless you're swept away with the excitement of it all. The characters is what makes the story as there's quite a mixture - good and bad.

I don't know what else to say other than this: There is so much wonderful nostalgia, especially if you've been with the series right from the beginning."
803,804,5,"The very best part about this edition is not only being handed the opportunity to go back to my reading roots and relive the magic that IS Harry Potter, but to be able to be surprised every single time you turn the page by a new rendering of our most holy of places... no words. No damn fucking words. I was in awe from beginning to end and I swear that if they did this for every book and made the books $50 a pop I would save my damn money so I could buy them all. It is a magical experience, and to think kids these days are going to have the opportunity to read it this way. No words.

There are also the little things you start noticing now that you are an adult and you are re-reading HP. Like Dumbledore evading Mcgonagall's questions at the beginning and feigning ignorance as to how Harry survived, Sirius Black's name thrown into the fray at the very beginning by Hagrid, Ginny being all excited over meeting Harry, Ron being extremely annoyed at Hermione, Neville being a complete and utter doofus, the twins... All very bitter sweet and totally magical."
804,805,5,"It's amazing!! So great!! I didn't know that the movie has hidden lots of good scenes from the book. The most beautiful and interesting ones are all in the book!

Of course, the book is way way better than the movie and I can't believe it took me time to finally pick this up. I love the golden trio a lot and I didn't even thought that Hermione is a lot more nerdy in the book and she helped Ron and Harry a lot in studying. I love their friendship a lot, it's so precious that all I could do is wish I have the same set of friends who value me like they all do with each other. It's just the most beautiful thing. Their bravery is priceless.

I love how J.K. Rowling writes also. It's hilarious in some ways, she explain it in the most relatable way, the words all compliment each other, and she uses third point of view which is great knowing this many characters.

I will definitely reread this next year. It's just so beautiful! PHENOMENAL! J.K. Rowling is precious!"

Five stars, of course!
There is no greater home than the Harry Potter books. I adore these books more than I can ever express in words. The first major series I ever read, the books that got me into reading, my favorite series.
It was so nice to read this book again and the pictures were an added bonus, Jim Kay is a wonderful artist. J.K. Rowling's words are so great. Being back with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Fred and George, Hagrid, and everyone else made me so happy. There are some things that I had forgotten like how much I dislike the Dursley's, the purple and black fire walls scene at the end, and how much I love Dumbledore. So those were great to revisit.

If you haven't already, pick up these books. They are so worth it.
I'll keep waiting on my Hogwarts letter, even though it almost feels like I've already been."
806,807,5,"Can you believe that it is 20 years ago that this book first came out?!
I was 5 years old, so obviously I didn't read it back then, but I remember that my older sister read them. I started reading them at the age of 10, around the time the movie came out and was obsessed with it.
I made a wand out of sticks I found in the forest and played being a witch, gave my bookpresenation at elementary school about this book and bought 'Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans' to share in class while presenting (And got an A!). I am now at the age of 25 and i'm still wearing HP pj's and socks, I own 3 different editions of this book (and soon to be 4, since I have my eyes set on the Hufflepuff edition), and have 2 fish named Fred and George.

It is such a big part of my childhood and will forever be a part of my life."
807,808,5,"This is where my love for books started but it started on the big screen. My parents took me to the theater to see Harry Potter and i still remember it because they had also brought me to the dentist that day, and the last thing I wanted to do is go out.
As soon as the music started though, I was hooked, and my tooth pain gone. In the following days, I only wanted one thing: to read the actual book and discover all the details in it. And there are so many details!!!
I think I've read this first installment about 30 times since, and I still find details I didn't see or didn't pay attention to before. Usually it's just some bits of humor that I didn't get, sometimes it's something in the description of characters.
My book is pretty beat up at this point and it makes me love it even more..."

This is a reread after many years. I have read this book when it came out only once and I loved it a lot. I liked the movie as well. Today I finished rereading it and I can say it is as fun and charming as the first time I read it. Everything about it, the adventure, the characters and the writing. In my opinion, it has no fault or any negative attributes at all. It is the perfect book to cheer you up when you need that. I have not read all the series so what I am going to do is read every book and watch its movie as I finish the book. Can't wait to get into the second book next month.

This gets from me a perfect 5 stars."
813,814,5,"Magical. I read this back when I was a kid but have already forgotten all about it. This brings back such lovely memories. I’ve also discovered many details I failed to notice back then.

Harry Potter can be really reckless and nosy. He wants to be the best (I think he is a bit jealous of others better than him but I'm not quite sure yet). If he wasn't the main character, I don't know if he would have been able to make it out of his countless escapades or not. I'm looking forward to his character growth and the friendship he has with Ron and Hermione. Cant wait to read about the romance part because I'm a sucker for romance. Even in YA fantasy."
814,815,5,Ok.... I’m wayyyyy late to Harry Potter... when it was first published I was in my 20’s and my jam back then was strictly romance ; mostly historical romance. Then as the years went by and I started dipping my feet into fantasy books I felt like I was to old to enjoy Harry Potter since Harry is pre teen. But o was still curious!! So a few days ago I told myself I’m not going to put limits on myself on what I can read. And I’M SO GLAD I FINALLY READ IT!! And... I’m now gonna read book 2!! Seriously I think Harry Potter is a book for ALL ages... what a fantastic story.
815,816,5,"I definitely enjoyed this more the second time that I read it. I missed a lot of the subtle British humor back when I was twelve. I really love this series because it introduced me to an unbeatable fantastical world and magic system and I connected with these characters so much. Of course this series is iconic and rightfully so. Harry Potter is timeless, and I hope that my future kids read it someday and feel the same magic I felt when I first read it. ✨"

817,818,5,"Bien sûr, il s'agit d'une saga pour enfants. Mais honnêtement je suis d'avis qu'Harry Potter, c'est bien plus ! Et même si j'ai 20 ans, même s'il s'agit d'une relecture... j'ai adoré chaque mot de ce livre. Tellement qu'après toutes ces années, je ne m'en lasse toujours pas. J.K Rowling a une imagination à peine croyable, et son écriture séduira les lecteurs de tout âge.
JE LE CONSEILLE À TOUT LE MONDE ! Harry Potter est THE saga que tout librovore doit avoir lu au moins une fois."
818,819,5,"I was a but late with harry potter. I think when the fourth book comes out, then i start reading harry potter. And I am hooked. Can not sleep can not eat. all I know I have to read this book. And Harry potter is now beloved story in the 21st century. It creates a whole new culture.

J.K. Rowling is a good writer. Although sometimes the plot is dragging. Like she wants to keep the suspense but I found it irritating."
819,820,5,"Questa volta ho ascoltato l'audiolibro letto da Francesco Pannofino, anche se dire ""leggere"" è riduttivo. E' racconto, interpretazione, carezza. Ho ritrovato la storia che conoscevo, ma arricchita, grazie alla voce del narratore. Addormentarsi col racconto di una delle tue storie preferite nelle orecchie è la cosa più rilassante al mondo. E poi quei piccoli episodi che dimentichi col tempo, che nel film non sono riportati, è stato bello riscoprirli."
820,821,5,After watching these movies a million times I can’t believe it’s taken me so long to finally read this series. If I had read this when I was much younger I already know I’d be obsessed. Even though this was my first time reading it I still felt the same nostalgia I feel whenever I watch the movies. I’m so excited to continue! It really does hit different for me now. My love for this fandom is only growing more.
821,822,5,"Purely and utterly MAGICAL.

I can't wait for the next illustrated editions of the following books (specially The Prisoner of Azkaban, my fav ♡).

But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them."
822,823,5,"""Every child in our world will know his name""

The boy who lived once and will live forever in our hearts.
Being here again has left my seven year old self at surface again
The word home has never been more meaningful
It's so good to see you again, old friend, after all this time..."
823,824,5,"*Yes, let's write a review on your rereads of Harry Potter.*
No, how about we simply tell EVERYONE how much we love these books and words couldn't even begin to describe that feeling. Because that's more real.
*Yes, it is. Let's just keep it at that then.*
Thank you!

Rereading this novel was like coming home, guys.
Hogwarts will always be home."
824,825,5,"5 stars as always, reading this book as a child was magical and opened the door for my immense love for reading and visiting other worlds. Reading this with my children just made it that much more emotional for me. Watching their reactions was nostalgic for me because it brought me back to that age and what I had felt. I can't wait to keep reading the series with them.

Harry Potter for life"
825,826,5,"""Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. “Shake'em off… shake ‘em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this.""
Oh yaass, better shake it off like Tay-tay, Uncle Vernon."
826,827,5,"Obviously 5/5 stars, especially because DANG the illustrations in this are on point. They were breathtaking. I can not recommend this illustrated edition enough. Even if you've read the book a million times, reading this version is like seeing it with new eyes. I absolutely LOVED it."
827,828,5,Not even sure how many times I've read this at this point...but it never disappoints.
828,829,5,This would explain a lot.
829,830,5,Soooo I finally finished Book 1. Check out my review at my Booktube channel http://YouTube.com/peterlikesbooks
830,831,5,"La versione illustrata mi ha fatto amare ancora di più Harry Potter...Ah, che soddisfazione!"
831,832,5,"Always a pleasure to go back to childhood memories and read this book.
Can't get over the fact that, yes, the books are indeed better than the films."
832,833,5,Obviously.
833,834,5,"YES, JUST A BIG FAT YES!!!"
834,835,5,Well gee that was just terrible. What should I read next? Oh....book two. (Sigh) If I must....

854,855,5,"I can still remember the first time I held a Harry Potter book in my hands. In fact, the cover of my paperback copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has a small crease on it from the time I flipped it open in too much of a rush to read it. It has my favorite quotes underlined, witty passages starred, and is covered with post-it notes on nearly every page from the amount of times I've re-read it. Now, reading it again so many years later, I am taken back to all that magic, all that wonder, and all that amazement that I first had when I laid my eyes on these books.

In all honesty, this is a series that needs no review - avid fans will re-read it without hesitation, new book lovers will pick it up without even consulting a friend for approval, and it will live on in our world as a classic. Yet, as one for whom Harry Potter was a life-changing experience, I feel the need to justify, or at least explain, what this book has done for me and why it stands the test of time as a remarkable story, even today.

I am not the first one to begin analyzing the Harry Potter Series. Since the release of Deathly Hallows, there have been numerous authors who have attempted to make sense of a greater meaning within Rowling's work. Some have even claimed that there are Biblical references of Christianity within her pages, but not being a Christian, I have never found them. Still others, like me, prefer to keep this book out of the scope for analytical reading and simply enjoy the story within its pages. I, by no means, think that J.K. Rowling is a brilliant writer. If anything, I think her writing is slow in some parts, lacks figurative language, and contains a dearth of descriptive passages. To me, good writers are people like Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Charlotte Bronte, J.R.R. Tolkien - or even more recently - Laini Taylor, Megan Whalen Turner, Cath Crowley, Melina Marchetta, and John Green. These are people whose ever word, every phrase, and every sentence is a beauty to behold and read. Rowling's work is not like that, but what makes her stand out from all others is her imagination, creativity, and her art of storytelling. No one else can quite tell a story like Rowling can and she does a splendid job tying up all the loose ends and fitting together every small clue to make a bigger puzzle piece. In fact, I was astonished yet again while reading The Sorcerer's Stone this past weekend for seeing names such as ""Sirius Black"" ""Peter Pettigrew"" and ""Grindlewald"" come up even in the first installment of this series. It is clear that Rowling not only puts forth a lot of thought into her writing and plot outlining, but her manner of telling a story and uncovering the small pieces is unrivaled.

Rowling's talent aside, what strikes me the most about the series is the fact that I am able to glean something new from it every time. When I was younger and first read this, I learned that it is okay to be smart and intelligent and a know-it-all, but it is even better to be brave and courageous and strong. The second time I re-read this while waiting for Order of the Phoenix to release I took strength from the fact that if Harry could survive without his parents for so long, even I could spend a summer without them in India. Much later while waiting for Deathly Hallows to release I began to realize how truly dark and forbidding even this first installment of the series was. I was struck by the horror of the Forbidden Forest and found myself thinking long and deep about what it meant to live a cursed life. I also finally found myself appreciating Dumbledore's cleverness in using the Mirror of Erised to ensure that only one who wishes to find the stone and not possess it would be the one to come in possession of it.

Over the years, my parents have become resigned to the fact that this is a series that I will eventually be forced to re-buy at some point in my life because eventually, the spine will break from over-use. Yet, while they have become resigned to this fact, I have come to marvel at the magic within its pages even more for every time I re-read this series, not only am I transported into happiness, joy, and the feelings of wonder I felt when I first read this, I am also able to glean something new from it every single time. That, in my opinion, is the true reason that the Harry Potter Series will live on forever. It isn't something you can ever get tired of reading, of living, of breathing. Furthermore, Rowling is able to integrate larger themes within younger novels with such ease that even the wisest of us can have it in ourselves to learn something from her books, her characters, and their experiences.

Thus, having read this book again this year for what seems to be the umpteenth time, I find myself once again stumped by the great and wise Albus Dumbledore. What I took from the series this time around is that Dumbledore is a liar. Now knowing about Dumbledore's less-than-honorable past, it is safe to say that Dumbledore most certainly did not see himself holding a pair of socks in the Mirror of Erised. If anything, he saw his family, just like Harry did. So, despite being ten years older, ten years wiser, and ten years more mature than when I first started these books, I have learned once again that even the noblest amongst us lie and although falsehood is not condoned, sometimes it is necessary in our lives. It is times like now that I find myself in awe of Rowling and wish to thank her for all she has ever given me, because no matter what is taken away from the world in war, famine, and poverty, magic and imagination are two things that can never be taken away from us.

855,856,5,"When you read a book 21 years after its publication, You don’t have the idea how to review it plus if you are most probably the last one then you REALLY don’t have any idea what to say. Let me try.

I’ve watched movies a couple of time and loved these, I can’t even remember how many times people suggest me to read HP but I was reluctant because stacks were too high, and from my past experience I know that hype books don’t do much good for me, I succeeded in resisting for 1 year and 2 months but not more, I gave up.

My opinions were different for many characters like Harry is over-rated he doesn’t do anything and he can’t except Hermione and Ron, and I couldn’t understand snape.

After reading the book I realized how wrong I was.

“It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.”

I start to like Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, or should I say now I understand their character, They aren’t that bad as they seem in the movie.

Harry is not useless as I used to think, Hermione was a little mean in the start, Ron is not that much dull. Neville got more role in the book…Malfoy is fun.

McGonagall really cares, Hagrid is coconut, Snape is not that much complex when you know all the details, Dumbledore is an ideal headmaster one can get.

“It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.”

How can I forget Weasley family, I am sure Harry can’t be Harry without them, They are the most ideal and loving family. They got every flavor in their family from Bill to Ginny.

I loved this book so much and regret so much Why I haven’t read it before.

“To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.”"
856,857,5,"Es ist bestimmt 20 Jahre her, seit ich das erste und einzige Mal Harry Potter gelesen habe. Damals kam es mir wie ein dicker Wälzer vor. Diesmal war es in 5 Tagen durch. :D Und es war genauso schön wie vor 20 Jahren. :)))"
857,858,5,Kitap kesinlikle daha güzel. Canım Harry. 💚❤️🌸
858,859,5,"Tohle vůbec nemělo chybu - ilustrovaná verze je vážně dokonalost ♥
5/5*"
859,860,5,"there are a couple of things that i want to make clear before writing this review.
First of all , i'm one of those people who didn't get the chance to read Harry Potter as a kid, and feel the joy in growing up with Harry, i didn't get the chance to be excited for the books and movie releases because as i said , Harry Potter wasn't introduced to me when i was a kid.
The second thing is , i became a PotterHead immediately after watching the last movie , which means am reading a book that am in love with it's story, even before reading it .

These three things makes it really difficult for me to rate and review this book but i'm gonna try and express my feeling towards it anyway :D !"
860,861,5,"The Harry Potter series wasn't my first or my favorite fantasy series as a child or adolescent (I was 11 the year the first book came out), but it's one of the most enduring for me. Re-reading Sorcerer's Stone, I'm struck by how great Rowling was at imbuing the wizarding world with pure wonder and delight and magic, and though there are dark elements at the edges, this is truly a book for children. The series grew up as Harry did, as he gained greater control over his abilities and grew into his own as a man, so too did the writing and storytelling reflect Harry's expanded, more knowledgeable view of his world. That's probably why Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix are my favorite volumes in this series: it's where Harry's perspective on magic and on people expands rapidly, and is forced to confront things he thought he knew and re-evaluate them, and our own knowledge and love of this world is greatly broadened as a result. But here, at the beginning, we don't know all of what's to come for Harry. We just know how incredibly exciting this world is, filled with whimsy and beauty and power, a space for brave deeds and strong friendship and still revel in the pleasures of being a child. It's a fantastic stand alone book, a great world for a child or adolescent to dive into (probably especially great for a more reluctant reader, since they'll turn the pages so fast and have delight in the things Harry is seeing and doing, they'll forget they're reading), and a nice entry point to an entire universe of unlimited storytelling potential and reader enjoyment.

This was a re-read (for probably the 50th time or so, I've lost count), and since there's no need for a traditional review, here are the things that grabbed me on this go round:

I must still be very much in touch with my childhood self, because the humor (that is very juvenile appropriate) still makes me laugh, even tiny little lines:



That Smelting stick just kills me.






Dumbledore. Perhaps Rowling's greatest character in the series. My personal take is Dumbledore is truly a somewhat eccentric man and given to whimsy, but does indulge in that image and plays it up to keep his adversaries and enemies off balance and underestimate him. I toe the line between the kindly, grandfatherly Dumbledore and the Machiavellian, greater good Dumbledore. But my Dumbledore is almost always intelligent and is most certainly compassionate and a believer of the good in people.

When Hagrid gives Norbert to Harry and Hermione, he puts Norbert's teddy bear in the crate so he won't get lonely: Norbert promptly decapitates the teddy bear.




From here, thousands of manipulative Dumbledore fanfics were born!"

Actual Rating: 5/5 MAGICAL ★ = 100%



It is very interesting to reread the first book of a series after so long. You read with an entirely different perspective. You are more keenly aware of minute details that, at first seem unimportant, but take on an entirely different scope when seen in a new light. I believe this is why I am enjoying the reread so much, it’s because I have a whole new outlook on it all. It’s an entirely new discovery process, we have come full circle. It’s a real treat!

I have been wanting to re-read these books for ages now. It has been some years since I last read the Harry Potter books. And I am thrilled that I decided to finally re-read them now. Because I adored reading this first book again. It is so awesome. I had a few issues, but mostly loved it a whole lot.

One thing that I noticed straight away about Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is that Harry, himself is quite saucy and really funny. I don’t remember it having this impression on me when I was younger. There were so many moments when I couldn’t believe how funny the book is! It’s a really different tone from the films — which I see as having a much darker and more serious undertone — and really makes the story come alive in a lighthearted and fun way.

Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could of gone to when they where eleven. And there many adventures befall the trio (Harry, Ron and Hermione) and the stone in the book's title is centred to all that happens. The story builds towards and exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.



I don’t know how many readers out there have not had the chance, or the inclination, to begin their journey to Hogwarts. I envy you this chance to step on board the Hogwarts Express for the first time, to discover a world that will certainly suck you in and leave you gasping at its vivid richness. There’s nothing quite like embarking on a new series, and Harry Potter is definitely not one you should miss. To those who are old hands at Hogwarts, I can only say there’s nothing wrong with a re-read. These books are like fine wine; they only get better with age. Welcome back to Hogwarts!

862,863,5,"Well, what should I say about this masterpiece? I am a bit baffled to say something about it. Now can't write a word right after just finishing my first ever fantasy book. And I am lucky that I have started with great Harry Potter. Tons of tons of thanks to those who forced me to start reading Harry Potter.

My reader friends were deeply shocked when they discovered that I was totally ignorant about Harry Potter. I have read a lot of hotchpotch in my life, but never read a Potter. I must be an idiot. Actually I was not that much fantasy lover. All that years I ignored Harry Potter. He failed to grow my single interest on him. Once I bought the first 3 books and gave them to cousin without reading a word. But now after finishing Harry Potter's first book, I admit very honestly,

I LOVE YOU HARRY POTTER.

Surprisingly, I took too long to finish it. Not because I was a bit busy with my life, but I read it quite slowly as well to cope up with the fantasy world of Harry Potter and the environment of the Hogwarts and to know the characters deeply. But knowing the characters did not help me much. Why? You have to finish the book at first. You have to find out the answers by your own. :)

J.K. Rowling was very successful to make the journey easy for me. She introduced each and every bit of the environment and wizardry staffs very carefully to her reader. From Private Drive to Diagon Alley to Hogwarts School, she portrayed it perfectly.

I cannot complain about the environment, the characters and the story, because the author is not giving me a single chance to do so. She is the Queen of Fantasy for me so far. A smart story regarding a secret stone, with smart characters with full of strong dialogues in a fantasy environment. A school full of students and teachers, full of activities, studies, games. This quidditch is heaven of a fun to read about. I wish I could play quidditch once in my life! So what else is required?

Yes, what else is required? Someone missing. Yes! A Villain. And the Villain is YOU-KNOW-WHO? In the later books of the series, I am going to meet the most fierce and violent villain in my life. Lord....shhhh! Can't utter the name....!!!

Nothing to say much holding the second book of the series, """" in my hand. To be very honest, my heart and mind have been occupied with Harry Potter for the last one month. And I am afraid, this occupation will last until I finish all the books of the series.

I am a bit conservative in rating. But nothing but a 5 stars (*****) for cute Harry Potter. How can I resist myself from giving ***** to this very lovable book?"
863,864,5,"What stands out in book one:

* Harry's first trip to the zoo with the Dursleys, when a boa constrictor winks at him.
* When the Dursleys' house is suddenly besieged by letters for Harry from Hogwarts. Readers learn how much the Dursleys have been keeping from Harry. Rowling does a wonderful job in displaying the lengths to which Uncle Vernon will go to deny that magic exists.
* Harry's first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid. Full of curiosities and rich with magic and marvel, Harry's first trip includes a trip to Gringotts and Ollivanders, where Harry gets his wand (holly and phoenix feather) and discovers yet another connection to He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. This moment is the reader's first full introduction to Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizards.
* Harry's experience with the Sorting Hat.


Amazon Review:
Say you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who loathes you. Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. In the nonmagic human world--the world of ""Muggles""--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley.
A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: ""We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."" Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, ""I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!"" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins."
864,865,5,"E' stato un piacere recuperare questa piccola perla. Ricordo che quando lo lessi la prima volta ero davvero piccolo, e subito mi immedesimai magnificamente con il piccolo Harry (sebbene i miei zii non mi chiudessero in uno sgabuzzino e i miei genitori fossero ancora vivi... e sebbene nessun signore oscuro avesse cercato di eliminarmi...). Dannazione, credo che chiunque ami questa fantastica saga stia ancora aspettando che arrivi una piccola lettera che ti invita ad Hogwarts. Ebbene sì, sono tra quelli. Nulla di cui vergognarsi. Sono felice che quel mio lato bambino, anche grazie soprattutto alla Rowling, sia ancora lì. Che non si stanchi a sorridere a immaginarsi le buffe espressioni di Ron, l'impacciataggine di Paciok, la saccenza di Hermione e la prontezza di spirito di Harry. Una storia di piccoli maghetti e un Oscuro Signore.

Tornare a leggere La pietra filosofale dopo così tanto tempo è un po' come quando a distanza di decenni finisci in cantina, nella polvere, a tirare fuori vecchi quaderni dell'asilo. Quaderni che tua madre conserva con tanto amore. Li apri e vedi i tuoi vecchi disegni, la tua vecchia calligrafia. E hai un tuffo al cuore perché ti ricordi quando eri piccino, e in quei disegni lasciavi spazio alla sola immaginazione. Non ti importava della coerenza, che le persone fossero rosa e non verdi, che un braccio fosse più lungo dell'altro o che gli esseri umani non volassero.

Quello della Rowling parte come un racconto per ragazzi per diventare qualcosa di sempre più maturo. Numero dopo numero, avventura dopo avventura, la storia si fa sempre più complessa, adulta e matura. Ed è una cosa che adoro quando vedo letteralmente evolversi i personaggi. Da ragazzini diventano adolescenti, e da adolescenti adulti. Harry Potter ha preso un grandissimo spazio nel mio cuore, e lì credo rimarrà per sempre.

Trovo persino inutile dire di cosa parla, poiché penso che persino i muri conoscano le vicende almeno del primo libro. Cinque stelle meritate perché a distanza di anni si legge ancora che è un piacere. Questo, per me, è da considerarsi un capolavoro. Una di quelle opere che va letta. E non mi riferisco al primo libro e basta. Bensì all'intera saga."
865,866,5,"This is my third time reading the book, but my first time reading it in English. I love the book but I don’t know why I never read it in its own language before. I also love the Indonesian edition. I think the translation was superb. But now, reading it in English gives me different feeling and perspective than when I read it in Indonesian. At the same time, I feel like this is my first time reading the book, despite that I’ve already known the story.

The first thing that gets my attention between the Indonesian edition and the original one is the way Hagrid speaks. Indonesian edition doesn’t contain Hagrid’s accent. To be honest, it’s quite hard for me to understand Hagrid’s speaking at the beginning, because of his accent. I have to guess what he actually means. But at the same time I think it also shows Hagrid’s position in the witchcraft and wizardry world and also in Hogwarts, describes who he is and where he comes from. I have better understanding about him now.



As much as I love Ms. Listiana Srisanti works, the translator of Indonesian edition, I think there are things that feel better when I read it in English. This book is funnier than I ever remember. I just love Ron’s witty and sarcastic conversation and the twins that always can make me laugh.

And rereading it now, a couple years from my last read gives me clearer perspective of the story and the characters. The characters development is awesome. I never realize how different Harry and Neville in the beginning of the book and the end of the story; and looking back now, they are even much more different and grow in the last book. How I love the way Harry and Ron befriend with Hermione. Just like the characters development, their friendship also grows throughout the story. I also more appreciate the way Rowling writes. It feels magical, just like the story. I guess I much more love it now, if it’s even possible. That being said, I add my rating now into 5 perfect stars. This won’t be my last rereading the book, though. If I can reread it in Indonesian edition, I’m sure I can reread it in English."
866,867,5,"Bueno, pues aquí vengo al fin con la reseña del primer libro de ""Harry Potter"". Tenía muchísimas ganas y muchísima curiosidad a la hora de estrenarme con estos libros, pues son universalmente conocidos. Lo que ocurre es que cuando comenzaron a publicarse yo ya era un poco mayorcita y me pilló con otras lecturas, pero como nunca es tarde si la dicha es buena, y encima ahora leo de todo, pues aquí estoy con él.

Primero os diré que no voy a dejar sinopsis porque creo que no habrá prácticamente nadie que no conozca, aunque sea a groso modo, de qué trata esta saga y por consiguiente éste, su primer libro. Me voy a centrar más en mis impresiones durante su lectura.

Lo primero que ha llamado mi atención a sido su sencillez, pensaba que sería una obra mucho más elaborada en lo que a la narración se refiere, pero me he encontrado con una forma de contar las cosas extremadamente sencilla, pero deliciosa, pues te imaginas todo el ""universo Potter"" sin dificultad ninguna pese a la sencillez que os comento, lo cual para mi siempre es de agradecer pues se convierte en una lectura amena y sin complicaciones. Está claro que es un libro juvenil y por lo tanto no suelen ser complicados de leer pero al tratarse de un universo diferente pensé que quizá se enrollaría más con descripciones y tal, pero no ha sido así.

Por otro lado, si no lo mejor, casi, son los escenarios. Ese majestuoso castillo, con sus innumerables salas, estancias y escaleras, es maravilloso. Además de ese lago y bosques que lo rodean que aunque no sean protagonistas, al menos de momento, los intuyes y te arropan.

Muchos de sus personajes también son destacables, pues han quedado fijados, a lo largo de los años, en la imaginación colectiva, tanto de los lectores de la saga como de los seguidores de sus adaptaciones cinematográficas, convirtiéndose para siempre en iconos de lo mágico.

Por lo tanto, un libro muy ameno, que creo que merece la pena conocer aunque sea por mera curiosidad. Os resultará una lectura muy fácil y agradable.

¿Preparados para desenfundar baritas?

868,869,5,"10 anni fa chiusi per l’ultima volta l’ultimo libro di Harry Potter, e mi promisi di rileggerli tutti 10 anni dopo. Me lo sono promessa perché, nonostante avessi 11 anni, sapevo che una rilettura da più grande e più matura mi avrebbe fatto cogliere cose diverse e sfumature che prima non avrei colto.

Se sono quel che sono e se sono la lettrice che sono è grazie a Harry Potter, ma soprattutto grazie alla Pietra Filosofale. Questo libro è ciò che fa sognare, ti fa sentire bambino, ti fa sentire parte di una storia e di un mondo così strano ma cosí comprensibile ai nostri occhi.
Da bambina mi brillavano gli occhi quando leggevo la lista del materiale che Harry avrebbe dovuto comprare per il suo primo anno ad Hogwarts, e 10 anni dopo non e cambiato nulla: mi sono immaginata le spese a Diagon Alley e ho fantasticato su che animale mi sarei portata ad Hogwarts (probabilmente un bel gufo o un gatto come Hermione).

Ho letto il libro nella nuova traduzione e devo dire si aver fatto un po’ fatica a non vedere più i nomi con cui sono cresciuta: la Professoressa McGrannit, Neville Paciock, Raptor, Baston, Madama Sprite, e altri hanno tutti cambiato nomi e mi ci è voluto un po’ per abituarsi.

Silente è uno dei miei personaggi preferiti, ogni volta che dice qualcosa sono pronta a imparare da lui e dalle sue mille avventure. Non per caso la mia frase preferita, con cui chiudo questo mio pensiero che doveva essere sí poche righe, si conferma essere: “non serve a niente rifugiarsi nei sogni e dimenticarsi di vivere”.

Scusi Silente, ma continuerò a sognare e a dimenticarmi del mondo attorno a me quando leggo Harry Potter."
869,870,5,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the entry to a world of fabulous fantasy and magic that any kid can dream of. The plot is top-notch, taking the readers along the journey with an orphaned boy in a lonely world to a whole new spectacular universe, a fabulous wizarding school, one filled with adventures and magic, where he is to thrive for the rest of his teenage years with new-found friends, have spats with rivals, go down for a cup of tea at the gamekeeper's hut, play an awesome sport on broomsticks and fighting an evil, bloodthirsty wizard who is taking over the world while simultaneously saving the Philosopher's Stone, an important magical artefact. is a brilliant author and has an exquisite way of detailing things, that you can almost feel them with all your senses, and you get so involved with the characters that you emotionally start relating to them.

The whole book is full of light-hearted humour, magical themes and full of adventure at the same time, making it perfectly kid-friendly while providing a sense of thrill at the same time. I LOVED this book and got hooked into the series the moment I read the first page. One thing stands clear for Harry Potter series, it is a timeless classic, one that, no matter what, will be remembered throughout the centuries and read by many different generations in the world..."

My First Favourite Book That Actually Got Me Into Reading And Introduced Me To This And Many Other Fandoms!
This is a fantastic book written for book lovers and to turn normal people into something's called ""potterheads"".

""We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled.""
This book is about a normal boy who turns out to be much more than just a boy- *Harry Potter*. He goes to the chosen school just for people like him where in he finds his 2 soulmates and some of the greatest professors . The soulmates are so important that he wouldn't survive 2 days without one of them:-Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger.
This is the first year where in he learns a lot of things about himself that weren't told to him , or wrongly told. Finally once things start getting clear, having the blood of his father in him , he gets into mystery that makes his first year memorable .

Notes:-
-I am still waiting for my acceptance letter , though I'm sure I'm gonna get it sometime.
-I need the sorting hat to sort me officially.
-I like Draco and Snape best . You'll find out why once you read ahead
_______________________________________
If I say anything more, i might just spill out the whole book. So I'm gonna stop right here and right now.

If you have read this book you understand me , well if you haven't, then you better read it.
Happy Reading!"

Обаче да ми разправят, че книгата нямало да се помни :D:D:D Толкова ми е забавно, че нямам сили да го напиша на английски, за да отговоря на въпросното момиче. Хари Потър е детска приказка. Все едно да ми кажете, че не помните Червената шапчица, Хензел и Гретел, Болен здрав носи и т.н.
Не повдигала въпроси... ми прочети седемте книги и почни отначало, за да видиш в първата книга един весел Дъмбълдор, който успешно прикрива толкова болка и чувство за вина; да видиш един наранен, отхвърлен и мразен от всички Снейп, който действително прави най-голямата саможертва в тази книга след Лили Евънс. Бе толкова цитати мога да извадя от тази книга, които да послужат за един хубав литературен анализ в стил Кушлева, ама да не се престаравам. Любовта ми към тази книга няма да умре, защото е обвързана с прекалено много приятни емоции.
И след като прочетох няколко негативни ревюта на книгата, бях готова да пиша тритомен отговор на всеки, ноо мисля, че няма смисъл да си хабя времето и думите. По-скоро бих си препрочела някоя от книгите, защото в тях наистина има магия, която винаги ме кара да се чувствам по-добре."
872,873,5,"Do I really need to write about this book ?

When harry potter comes to my mind I remember 2 things of my childhood. My mouth was always hanging open when I was watching movie and of course unavoidable & inevitable crush on Emma Watson. I watched movie first because I didn't read too well. Though I didn't understand the 95% of what they were saying ( I hardly knew English) but still every time I finished watching the movie we (me and my cousins) were just running with brooms. Lots of brooms were broken at nan's house then.Not to mention the brawl with older cousins to watch Harry Potter on DVD(there hadn't reached cable in that time). Mini wrestling for playing the roll of Harry Potter. In the end there would be 3-4 Harry Potter or 3-4 Harry Potter's twin brother, sometimes both. The reason I am telling this because Harry Potter is the name which is related to huge part of my childhood. So, still whenever I read the book or watch the movie I can't stop but remember those days where I had done stupid things . But I wouldn't get tired of doing this beautiful stupid things . I am glad I had done this stupid things. Because these are the both highlight and details of my childhood.

Thanks to J.K. Rowling."
873,874,5,"La storia è nota, e da qui si può dire che sia partito tutto.
Avevo letto il libro moltissimi anni fa, ormai, e poi ovviamente erano arrivati i film.

Una rilettura, dopo tutto questo tempo, ci stava bene. E quale migliore occasione se non questa edizione bella nuova, illustrata?

Premesso quindi che la storia è piacevolissima, un tuffo all'indietro con la memoria sia nelle vicende di Harry sia nella propria infanzia, e premesso anche che certe parti le avevo ormai scordate (praticamente tutto l'inizio), il vero valore aggiunto del libro sono le illustrazioni.

Illustrazioni a doppia pagina, illustrazioni a singola pagina, illustrazioni che fanno il capolino in mezza pagina. Pagine prese da altri libri di magia di Hogwarts.
Macchie e striature che, subdole, sbucano ai lati delle pagine interamente ricoperte di testo, o si intravedono sotto le stesse lettere.

Insomma, una gioia per gli occhi che accompagna alla perfezione questa storia.
Adesso non vedo l'ora arrivino tutti gli altri libri in questa superba edizione, cui a voler fare le pulci può giusto mancare una copertina rilegata per essere l'edizione definitiva."
874,875,5,"First book in a series of 7 books. Beautifully told children's tale of a 11 year old boy who finds out that he's a wizard. Really good storytelling. This first book & #s 3 & 7 are my favorite in the series. This book focuses on showing Harry going from a setting where he was unloved and an outsider to his new school where he finds true friendship and a place he belongs and where he’s, for the most part, welcomed. I was so interested in this story. J.K. Rowling writes in such a way that I cared about the characters and her imagination is great as she creates an extremely detailed and unusual (but familiar too) alternate world. A fantasy book but as with all good fantasy books, there’s a lot of reality in there, especially in the relationships between the people, or this case, wizards & witches. There is also a message about the power of love. This book series will be a classic. Serious stories that are told with a lot of humor."
875,876,5,"This, of course, is a re-read. Or rather, it's a re-re-re-re-read. Actually, I've lost count of how many times I've read this book. But, it has new covers so I must buy them all.

The book is magic. Every time I read it, it reminds me of why I am an avid reader. I love everything about this book. The characters, the setting, the world and the whole story. It's a pure joy to read.



When I hear them talking all about their criticisms, or literary shortcomings, or the blah blah blah, but really... what does that all mean? And do I care?.. NO. As a readers I want to know, will I love reading this book. And, if you even moderately like fantasy and magical universes and good verses evil type of stories, then you will love this book. I love reading this book and I guess there is really nothing more to say."
876,877,5,"5th time
I have to say each time I read the first book, which has been in my opinion the weakest one, I come away more and more amazed at what talent is shown right from the beginning. It's in the small details that seem unimportant sprinkled throughout that come to the forefront at the end of the book. I am truly enchanted each time I read these.

Still brilliant! Still engrossing! Still in love with Harry Potter!

Merged review:

So I enjoyed this book - but I didn't LOVE it. I am hoping that the remainder of the series will justify all of the hoopla. I felt like Hermoine was not a very good female role model - she was whinny and a little miss know it all. And other than her there were no other strong female characters. In this day and age when young adult literature is awash with strong female leads it surprised me that Rowling didn't include more."

I first came across Harry Potter somewhere 12 years ago, by then only Last book in the series was pending to be published.

It was a nice good cozy concept for me then. I hardly read anything at that time. Harry being an orphan suddenly is thrust into a world of wizardry. He learns magic in wizard school, has friends and play quidditch and is obviously famous!! He defeats the Dark Lord, isn't it all cozy!!??

For me this book is like munching on hot potato chips on a rainy day, sitting by the window. Surely, the target readers were middle graders and the plot lacks complex magic but JK rowling did definitely a good job :)"
878,879,5,"Relectura. Obviamente las 5 estrellas son sólo por el cariño, si nos vamos a lo profundo, el libro tiene muchas falencias, sobretodo en los detalles que sientan las bases del mundo mágico (y en partes de las tramas posteriores).
Fue emocionante leer el libro después de chorromil años después de la primera lectura que le di. Además, leérselo a otra persona también fue super entretenido, ya que íbamos comentando los recuerdos que teníamos del libro y los comparábamos. Es increíble las diferencias que tiene con la película (que tampoco son tantas en este libro como será con los otros) y ver las diferencias de interpretación que han hecho las películas con respecto a los libros en los lectores, en plan, sobre como son ciertos personajes y escenas, etc.
Supongo que iremos releyendo los siguientes libros durante estos otros meses :)"
879,880,5,"Oh man, was this awesome.
I love every single character. Even Draco (not that I think anyone hates Draco). And Snape, my FAV. But I love Ron the most! THE MOST!

And the housecup battle was so amazing. Nobody was leaving any chance to drag the others down.

Every time Harry breathes Snape be like: ""50 points from Gryffindor""
And again every time Harry breathes Dumbledore be like: ""500 points to Gryffindor""

I hope there is more about HufflePuff and Ravenclaw in next books.

They don't send letters to 23 years old's to get admission in Hogwarts, do they? Because I really wanna go there. Like I always wanted to be a part of that world after watching movies... but I want it now even more. Anyways, we can always live it up in the books whatever we dream for. That's why we have books after all, right? I know I'm right about this thing at least. :)"
880,881,5,"This book was the book to get me into reading. This book is my life!! I've met so many people through the book. Amazing story about a 11-year-old boy who doesn't know he's a famous wizard. You'll meet many amazing characters such as Harry's two best friends, Ron and Hermione. This book is filled with such beautiful magic that will get you in the mood to receive your Hogwarts letter! This is a MUST read!!!


Future me speaking! - Reread this book from Nov 6 - Nov 9. The first time was back in third grade, and it took me THREE months at the time. Now it's taking me three days. I love this book so much, and the rest of the series. I hope to reread all of them before the new year. Anyways, read Harry Potter if you haven't, it's literally a life changing book!"
881,882,5,"Harry potter has been and will always be synonym to overwhelming emotion for me. The meaning of Hogwarts for me is school and home and friendship. We bonded over our shared experience of reading Harry potter, we laughed, we cried. I still remember we used to argue over the fact that who knows more spells than the other. I used to feel extremely happy thinking that my name starts with H too. 😂 I have ""Harry Potter"" written all over the wooden tables of my house. These things seem silly now. But the emotion is still the same as before and will always remain like that. Even when I am writing this, I feel myself grinning ear to ear and getting misty-eyed.

Okay! So it's time to take a trip down the memory lane. ❤️"
882,883,5,"5:e läsningen (om jag ska tro föregående anteckning)
Det här var precis vad jag behövde. Jag var på väg in i en djup lässvacka, men kom på att Harry Potter alltid är bra läsning. Detta var inget undantag. Det var underbart att vara tillbaka på Hogwarts. Jag hoppas bara att jag inte tappar fart nu utan fortsätter serien hela vägen ut.


4:e läsningen (tror jag)
Jag funderade på att sänka betyget till en fyra men slutet drar upp betyget till en femma igen.

Det var intressant att läsa boken igen nu när man vet i stort sett hela storyn (har inte läst bok 6 & 7, men sett alla filmer). Man ser de små tecknen som man inte såg tidigare."
883,884,5,"GAAAHHH..OMG OMG .. if I knew it would be that good I wouldn't waste so much time afraid of this story, let me start off by saying if you watched the movies and you think you know harry so well without reading the book think again, I watched the movie twice in my life and I only watched the first one .. and in my opinion the book was way WAY better .. it was well explained and the world building was marvelous :D .. can't wait to get started on the second book but I want to watch the first movie one more time so I can be a fair judge .. but it was good .. REALLY good .. I love George and Fred they are my favorites :D"

It's always good to reread a Harry Potter book. But this was the first time I had ever listened to the audiobook. This was a very enjoyable experience, I really liked how Stephen Fry has read this! I will probably continue listening to the other books, too!

February 2017:

886,887,5,"WHAT THE HELL AM I TO DO WITH MY LIFE??! There's an eternity till the next illustrated edition comes out...
But, oh man, I enjoyed this SO SO SO much! Jim Kay is a brilliant artist, and I loved his work in A Monster Calls a great deal, so I was extremely excited when I heard he was to illustrate THE ENTIRE HARRY POTTER SERIES.
I was a liiiitle worried that the pictures wouldn't fit the story quite right, but no need to! They were absolutely perfect, and I dont think anyone could've done it better. BRAVO."

I don't know what take me so long to read them but it has been so worth it

I've been a big fan of this saga since forever, and read now the books has giving me a new meaning of how much I love each one of the characters. They are all so freaking cute and I want to hug all of them.

Also, I find infinitely hurtful how hateful are the bad characters (The Dursley and Malfoys) and how good and lovely and the good (Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, etc.) and I'm enjoy every moment of this."

Bueno, ¿qué puedo decir de Harry Potter que no se sepa ya?

Es genial volver al mundo mágico de El callejón Diagon, King Cross o Hogwarts, el volver a estas páginas y querer que llegue esa carta soñada ✉️🦉.

Si nunca has leído Harry Potter, nunca es tarde, no te vas a arrepentir."
891,892,5,"I read this book when I was 11 years old,it was the first book I ever read and it's my favorite book ever. It introduced me a all new world, that I loved and wanted to live in, I was part of that world through the books and movies (the movies weren't the same thing) , I felt like I was the little girl that got her letter to Hogwarts. I think that I read this book 20 or more times ( a little bit to much, I know) but I love it, and I know that probably I will read it 20 times more."
892,893,5,"Lange ist es her, seit ich das letzte Mal Harry Potter gelesen habe. Doch viel hat es nicht von seinem Zauber verloren. Ich mochte die Geschichte immer noch sehr, auch wenn mir diesmal beim Lesen einige Dinge aufgefallen sind, die ein Lektorat noch hätte ausmerzen können :D Aber das Tempo ist gut, wir erfahren, was über das Jahr passiert und ich hatte nie (wie beim Magisterium leider der Fall) das Gefühl, dass ein Schuljahr hier nur sieben Wochen maximal dauert."
893,894,5,"I loved this book, I loved how there was a mystery that Harry had to solve among being new to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. It was beautifully written, and although marked as a ""Childrens book"", I being a teenager still loved it. When you find out the teacher that was working for Voldemort I gasped so loud my mother received a noise complaint. I read it in the summer and finished it in a matter of days. Overall: 5 stars"
894,895,5,"Devo dire la verità: ho cominciato a leggere Harry Potter perché ne parlavano tutti, pura curiosità. E invece... è nato un amore.
In questo primo capitolo ciò che più mi è piaciuto non è stata tanto la vicenda in sé, quanto la descrizione degli aspetti caratteristici del mondo dei maghi, Diagon Alley, il cappello parlante... scoprire un mondo parallelo così ben strutturato.

Seguiré leyendo toda la saga para conocer esas pequeñas diferencias entre libros y películas."

Pero me sorprendió mucho.
Lo escuché en audiolibro y no sé si eso causó que la experiencia fuera incluso mejor, ahora puedo entender porque lo alaban tanto, siendo sincera pensé que exageraban un poco, y bueno, ahora me arrepiento de no haberlo leído antes."
898,899,5,"I love Jim Dale's narration of these stories. He really brings all the characters to life and brings such joy to the work. I love the character of Peeves and wish he had been able to be in the movies. He brings a sense of levity to some dark situations. And I just love how Harry discovers he's a famous wizard after living in the cupboard under the stairs for a long time, if not all his life up to that point."

945,946,5,"Ok. Do *not* judge me. I was 7 (if my maths is correct) when the first Harry Potter film came out. I definitely wasn't reading them at that point in my life. And it petrified me. To the point where I had to sleep with the lights on for over a month, and every time I watched it after that, the lights had to go back on. However, as I reach the midway point of my twenty-fifth year, I've decided that it's time to get over that fear. And the way to do it? Read the book first to sooth my frazzled nerves. Actually very well written. Not as petrifying as my seven-year old brain thinks. Not sure that I'll be watching the movie any time soon though....!"
946,947,5,"Yes gehaald :) helemaal voorgelezen in dagelijkse whatsapp-voorleessessies aan mijn brugklasbroer. Op naar deel 2, maar nu eerst de film maar eens kijken samen. Was leuk om samen te doen!

-----------------------------------


""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" is the first book of a series of seven books called Harry Potter by British writer G. K. Rowling. The hero of the book is a boy named Harry Potter, lean, black-haired, and wearing round glasses. He lived after his father's death at his aunt Petunia, her husband Veyron and their only son Dudley in his aunt's house. Public (non-magicians). Next to friends, Harry also encounters enemies, one of them is Draco Malfoyle, the only son of the Malfoy family of pure blood (that is, all his family are magicians). At the beginning of the first school year, the students are divided into four houses, namely: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Havelbav and Ravenklo. Harry and his friends are classified in the house of Gryffindor, the house of heroes. Malfoy sends to the house of Slytherin, to whom he sent most of the dark magicians. The story revolves around the philosopher 's stone, hidden in the school, under the control of teachers, Harry and his friends are preparing a plan to save the stone that will be stolen, and the teacher of magic recipes Professor Severus Snape becomes the first suspect.

Enter the world of witches and be the way Harry Potter will really be the most beautiful and most wonderful entry to this world, a world full of excitement and suspense mystery, a world that makes you never stop reading it and discover more and more about him and in all ways, the author created in writing this series, especially the first part, category suspense The attraction was excellent and attracted you from the first pages and makes you stick to it and want to discover more.
After reading the introduction to the character of Harry Potter and with some mystery will make you want to discover more, has emerged character Harry Potter this little orphan boy who lives with his relatives injustice and be very sympathetic to him, but after discovering some things makes you continue to read and discover more.
The written style, narrative and dialogues are excellent, the novel is quite fascinating and read it quickly (so I can't believe myself) the attraction is excellent, some reservations in using some words can be especially have a small class that reads the novel, but the novel is aptly excellent."
950,951,5,"""You might belong in Gryffindor,
Where dwell the brave at heart,
Their daring, nerve and chivalry
Set Gryffindors apart;
You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Where they are just and loyal,
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
And unafraid of toil;
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
If you’ve a ready mind,
Where those of wit and learning,
Will always find their kind;
Or perhaps in Slytherin
You’ll make your real friends,
Those cunning folk use any means
To achieve their ends.""

I'm sure that, at this point, everyone has heard about the story of the Boy who Lived, so writing a review for this book, this series that I've listened to and read countless times (honestly, I think it's already illegal to read it again) will be more challenging than anything. How do you express your thoughts about something that you love soooo much and yet it's also pretty well known?



However, for those of you who have no idea what this book is about (in case you've been living in a cupboard under the stairs and didn't have access to the internet and books), here's the quick summary of it. .



At first, like 9 years ago or so, I wasn't really impressed. I'd seen the film and I honestly thought it was enough. But then I ended up with the entire book series (thanks, mum), and I suddenly had a new obsession. This book has it all: an extremely well built world, fantastic creatures and utterly brilliant plot twists, amazing relationships between characters,  character growth and, sometimes, life lessons.



It quickly became my comfort series, because everything is so well written and so realistic, that you fall in love and find a family with these characters. It's sadness intertwined with hope, happiness and love; it's the story of a young boy who goes from an unwanted and unloved kid to a strong young adult, it's a portrait of friendship and bravery. If you haven't read it yet, you should. There is definitely a reason why this series became the phenomenon that it is today."

Esta es la saga que me hizo amar la lectura.

Ha sido una relectura muy reconfortante. Creo que nunca me cansaré de leer Harry Potter, aún cuando me vuelva vieja y arrugada lo seguiré disfrutando. Me encanta la complejidad de sus personajes y la ambientación tan bien lograda. Es como ver una peli en tu mente, imaginando a un Hogwarts soñado y a niños con capas dirigiéndose apresuradamente a sus clases. Rowling es una genia, nos introduce a su mundo mágico de manera natural y sorpresiva. Me acuerdo que cuando lo leí por primera vez el final no me lo esperaba, aunque sospechaba algo.

Sin nada más que decir, :"

How do you rate or review a book that shaped the childhood of millions of people across the world? How do you analyse objectively a story that actually gives meaning to the word “hyped”? You simply don’t. Harry Potter is a modern phenomenon; it has sold millions and millions of copies, has been translated into more than seventy languages and it has been adapted into one of the most successful movie franchises of all time. Almost every kid, who grew up around the time these books were written has at least heard the name “Harry Potter”,while most of us dreamed about Hogwarts and wondered what our wands or patronuses would look like or which house we would be sorted into (thank God for Pottermore).

So yes, I grew up reading about Harry and his adventures. I am as big a Potterhead as any, a proud Slytherin and a huge Snape advocator – I’m sorry, James’s fans. I’ve talked about this series a thousand times, online and in real life, I’ve seen the movies again and again to the point I can actually recite the dialogues by heart and I’ve read a ton of fanfiction. The only thing I’d never done was re-read the books. I’m not a re-reader really; I feel too intimidated by my TBR pile to go back to already read ones. But there was another reason why I’d never picked up Harry Potter again, notwithstanding my great love for the series. As I’ve already said I literally grew up reading these books; I would dive into them as soon as they got published, my age almost matching Harry’s. The truth is that I had always been scared that by picking them up again, now that I am somewhat more of a critical reader, I would have found faults that could have ruined the magic for me. But recently I decided that I was going to re-read them, no matter what. And yes; I found faults and I realise that Harry Potter is not the greatest piece of literature that has even been written (how could it when there are the likes of Dostoyevsky, Dickens, Hugo, even George R.R. Martin out there?). Most of the characters are not so deep or complicated (there are some wonderful exception though) ,some of their decisions are rushed and don’t make so much sense
and sometimes you have to roll your eyes at how easy the heroes get away with things
.

The thing is though, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is a children’s book. It’s beautiful and magical, whimsical and funny. No matter how bad you’re feeling, Harry’s world will find a way to comfort you. It is, and always will be, one of my favourites throughout the series. Reading about the time these famous heroes first met, their turbulent future unbeknownst to them, makes me feel so nostalgic and peaceful. Yes, I’ve read more well-thought-out books, but this is the only one that shaped my childhood; I’ve became a reader because of Harry Potter, I’ve made friends because of Harry Potter, we even had nicknames based on our favourite characters. I’m giving this 5 stars not because it is the best piece of literature I’ve ever come across but because no other book will ever be as close to my heart as this one. I’m definitely continuing with the re-read."
954,955,5,"This is my second readthrough of this book. The first time I listened through the audiobook it was narrated by Stephen Fry. The second time I listened through Jim Dale read.

First I want to comment on the book; I've heard some people give negative reviews of the book for reasons such as the kids doing things that were against the rules and getting awarded for it. And how the adults seem to be pretty much helpless. Though I have two things to say about that.

First and foremost, everyone needs to realize that the story would be quite boring if we are following the adults around.

Second, adults don't always do what's right and they don't always listen to the youth that are seeing things. Often adults discredit what children see and say. Thus it makes perfect sense that they would be awarded for doing what they knew was right even though the adults were blind.

Now to the story, we start off with a very young Harry Potter and grow up with him. I don't understand why some people speak about the book in such a negative way saying insulting things about J. K. Rowling's writing abilities. I get a perfect image painted in my mind by her words and fall in love with the many characters and grow to hate the others. It's a magical journey of discovery, learning that you're more than what you think you are and going to a new place that you could only imagine in your wildest dreams and even then it's more fantastic still.

However it's not a fairytale dream where it's easy, there are struggles, dangers and your life gets put on the line. You learn secrets and there's darkness, but that is life and this book in many ways is both the lightest and the darkest of the entire series because it is the foreshadowing of everything that is to come, but the purity before the real storm.

In many ways it's my favorite book even though when I'm asked I don't typically name this book, it's hard not to think of this as one of the most endearing stories. It sets the bar, you learned about and meet characters. Then you fall in love with the deep story that the movies are unable to fully capture.

Now to speak to the audiobook portion of it. I am not saying that one Narrator is better or worse than the other.

My preference goes to Stephen Fry for the following reasons; First of all the sound effects are a lot more enjoyable in that version, second of all it is the UK version in my opinion that makes it better by default, another reason is I particularly like his voice over Jim Dale. Finally the biggest point was when I listen to him do certain key voices, like Hagrid and I really thought for a minute they had gotten the actor to do the voice. The only time I had problems telling characters apart with Stephen Fry was with Harry and Ron as they seem to sound a lot alike at times. Unlike with Jim Dale I felt the kid voices kind of muddled more, and at times he sounded light hearted when it felt off, but he excelled with the adult characters especially Mcgonicle.

Whether you simply read the book or get an audio version I would encourage you to try both audio authors and see which one you really like. Jim Dale is easily found on Pottermore and Audible, while Stephen Fry can only be found on YouTube or bought from the UK which is sadly very pricy."
955,956,5,"I first read this book 18 years ago when it was released. I was one of those kids, and still am. I attended every single midnight release party, even making wands and drinking ""pumpkin juice"" at 20 years old. I literally grew up with Harry Potter books and movies. To an 11 year old, Harry's exact age when he starts at Hogwarts, living in a new town and new state, in a small dumpy house, attending a new school and without friends, it was uncanny how much I could relate to young Harry. So for me, nostalgia plays a huge part in why I enjoy this story and am extremely forgiving of its weaknesses.

As I've said countless other times, I'm no mystery expert. But I feel that the mystery element of the story is very well done. Although I knew the answer to the big mystery, having read this before and seen the movie 100 times, Rowling gives plenty of classic misdirection to throw you off the trail. That's one enjoyment which makes for quick reading, just not knowing what's going to happen or ""whodunnit.""

But this story is so much more than mystery, it's a story of coming of age, the underdog, world building, and fantasy. And the orphan who ascends to power isn't even a new story, it's the classic story, but the unprecedentedly original world Rowling presents, the fangirl level of pure creative invention and cleverness, drawn out of pure desperation and the need for escapism, is heartbreaking. Who hasn't ever tried to wish themselves away from a bad time and place? Even as adults we still yearn for something more magical and eloquent than making dinner and paying bills. It's a muggle's life, isn't it? And Rowling plays right into it, having been on welfare as a single mother when writing this. It's the ""wouldn't it be magical if...?"" sentiment that makes this so special.

Now if you're anti-sentimental, independently wealthy, or had a great childhood, maybe this book is just a bunch of hyperbolic wizard and dragon nonsense. Oh Poor Harry, like he's the world's only orphan, the only sufferer of tragedies. Well, welcome to the First World. Everything in context. Because if you have ever been low, down, or less than, there's something for you in this book.

All of that grand preamble aside, the writing isn't perfect. There is unnecessary wording, loss of suspense, clunky dialog, information that's introduced prematurely which reveals too much about later mysteries, especially Harry's connection to Voldemort. But it's solidly good, and the story more than carries the writing.

Reading this at 11 and 29, I can say this stands the test of time. Much like Tolkien, the ideas, the characters, and the world supersede the writing. Because while I can't consider it the greatest literature ever, it's among the best stories ever told. It's absolutely epic. It's 1,084,170 words! These books spanned most of childhood and early adult years, and with the movies, Harry Potter reigned for 14 years! As a parent, I can't wait for my daughter to read these books for the first time. Can you imagine? I remember my heart raced as I read this and every book after, and it's still racing now."
956,957,5,"I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the first time right before the movie adaptation was released. I was a bit behind the already numerous series fans, but still managed to experience Harry before he took the remaining non-reading, but movie-loving world by storm. I read the books. I saw the movies. A lot. And as I patiently, yet sadly, await the release of the final part of the final movie I finally sat down to re-read the series in its entirely.

I could rave maniacally over the utter perfection that is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but I won't. That's been done. To death. Over 4,700 5-star reviews on Amazon.com alone.

What I will do is point out the things that became very obvious to me during this re-reading of the book. So many things became clear years later, that I never noticed or appreciated at the time of the first reading. As much as I'd like to take credit for being older and therefore wiser, the real truth of it was I became so enamored with the book from the first chapter that I devoured it as quickly as possible. Needing to know what happened, needing to experience this new and fantastical world, I read as fast as I could - totally glossing over things I wish I'd took the time to notice the first time around.

We all know Harry Potter is a wonderful story. Arguably the best of its generation. But I never noticed how wonderful the writing was until this re-read. This new world, complete in every minute detail, is world building at its finest. Never is the reader confused as to how the world is supposed to work or appear. Never do we stumble over the many invented words. The story flows so smoothly that you never realize how huge an endeavor this must have been for the author.

As the first book in a series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone lays the groundwork for everything to come. Harry's relationship with the Dursley's. Harry's friendship with Ron and Hermoine. Harry's rivalry with Malfoy. The tone is set for Harry's future interactions with Dumbledore, Hagrid, and Snape. So much character interaction, coupled with the introduction of both Hogwarts and the magical community as a whole, in such a small book. We know Rowling can write a doorstopper, so fitting all of these important things into barely 300 pages is nothing short of miraculous.

More than just magical adventure, Rowling weaves some charming humor into the Harry Potter world from the get-go. Naming Filch's mean, old cat Mrs. Norris - genius. And the school song. How did I miss that? It's ridiculous and wonderful all at the same time.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is often dismissed in favor of the later, darker books in the series, but I think that's a mistake. The entire series hinges on what is contained in this one book. The magnificence this series reaches by the end is only possible by the limitless imagination Rowling puts forth in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."
957,958,5,"Ja nisam nikad napisala nista zapravo o ovoj knjizi, a mozda bi trebalo,jer su ove knjige dosta uticale na moj zivot, kao sto su to mozda ucinili i filmovi, jer sve sto gledamo slusamo i citamo na nas na neki nacin utice i zato treba pazljivo birati sadrzaje koje cemo konzumirati , ne znam cemu sad ova digresija , elem naravno tu su i filmovi koji su poprilicno losi i koje sam kao dete vise gledala radi reda i nervirala se zbog toga sto nista nije kao sto je napisano i sto su mnoge scene izostavljene jos od prvog dela na primer ovde je izostavljena scena pri kraju romana kada redjaju neke napitke da otkuljcaju sledecu sobu ili vec tako nesto. Srecom ja sam uvek najpre citala knjigu, pa tek onda gledala film i za vreme filma bih zakerala sto nisu prilazali ovo ili ono kako treba, kako je u knjizi drugacije i kako nema citavih delova. Kasnije su izbacivani delovi uglavnom vezani za kvidic , na primer kada idu na onaj turnir ili kada se Hermiona bori za prava vilenjaka ili se ne pominje ona novinarka sto se pretvara u muvu i sto mrzi Hermionu , takodje odnos Hermione i Viktora Kruma je promenjen, zatim sva ona secanja kada gledaju u proslost pomocu magicnih predmeta su izmenjana. Takodje nije prikazano nibto koliko su zapravo Fred i Dzorz bili mocni i vesti carobnjaci i kakva su sve cudna pravili i izmislili da bi se sprdali i zajebavali i ponajvise vukli upravnik za nos , a to je steta , jer su u filmu samo epizodisti i sporedni likovi koji se pokadkad pojave da nesto kazu Hariju i onda odu. Hocu reci da su filmovi ovi bili jedno veliko gubljenje vremena i da mi ke donekle zao sto sam ih ikada pogledala ( al ne zato sto Dz Rouling mrzi transdzender ljude), lepo nam je jos Dositej rekao ""Knjige baco knjige a ne zvona i filmovi"", al mi dzaba kad ga nisam procitala. Ovo sad opet nema veze sa samom knjigom i mozda je malo random , ali eto samo sam htela reci da mi je zao sto sam toliko vremena uzaludno bacila na gluposti i besmislene sadrzaje, umesto da sam ih provela citajuci neke dobre knjige. I uvek me je nerviralo kako Ronov brat Persi nije prikazan kao totalni kreten i kaj je uvek uzasan u odnosu na knjigu, jer je taj Dambldor uvek tako neprijatan covek, a i cini se da nikad ne objasni sve lepo sta se dogodilo.
PS Gledam ti ja tako pre neki dan tu neku jutjuberku Ruby Granger koja je jelte nazvala svoj kanal po Hermijoni Granger iz istoimene knjige i tu snima kako po ceo dan uci i cita i pomisloim ja jebote kako ona izgleda ama bas isto kao Miljenko Jergovic samo sto ima glas one glumice iz filma i sad evo sam krenula da gledam opet sve filmove iz pocetka i sve mi se cini da ne gledam Hermionu nego glavo i bradom Jergovica i njegovu zenu to jest Rona, samo nekako obrnuto. I tako dots mi je zanimljivo u zivotu sta ja sve necu izmisliti samo da ne bi ucila."
958,959,5,"Nem sei por onde começar a falar no que diz respeito a este livro. Tenho tanta história com ele que nem num milhão de anos terminaria esta opinião. Penso que devo começar por vos falar desta edição em específico e do porquê de a ter adquirido.
Quando soube da futura publicação deste livro fiquei encantada. As poucas ilustrações reveladas eram maravilhosas e eu estava em pulgas para saber como seria o trabalho final. Além disso, para quem não sabe, eu li esta série e reli-a várias vezes ao longo dos anos, mas nunca tinha lido na sua língua original. Simplesmente não podia deixar passar a oportunidade. Ler o livro com a escrita original da nossa querida J. K. Rowling e ainda por cima nesta edição simplesmente soberba seria, sem duvida, uma experiência a não perder. Então decidi que o queria, mas não pude comprá-lo mal saiu principalmente devido ao preço (um pouco puxadote para a carteira, mas valendo cada cêntimo). Chegou o natal de 2015 e a minha mãe decidiu oferecer-mo como prenda. Fiquei boquiaberta quando chegou. O livro é, inacreditavelmente, ainda mais bonito ao vivo e a cores.
Não satisfeita por esta enxurrada de novas experiências, decidi juntar-lhe mais uma quando li uma notícia que mencionava os audiobooks desta saga. Esta fazia menções que a narração da saga pelo Stephen Fry era considerada uma das melhores 20 narrações de audiobooks de sempre. Não resisti. Além de ler e me deslumbrar com a beleza deste livro, deslumbrei-me também com a audição conjunta do audiobook narrado por Stephen Fry.
Como vocês já puderam perceber, esta não foi a minha primeira leitura deste livro pelo que a história em si já me é familiar. A escrita da autora é muito bonita e agradável e tãooooo fácil de ler e gostar. Se já gostei em português, sabendo as palavras exatas que a autora escolheu para este livro: o meu gostar atingiu proporções incalculáveis. As ilustrações de Jim Kay são a coisa mais linda, mais fofa, mais estranha, mais tudoooooo de maravilhoso que já vi. A narração do Stephen Fry é… sem palavras… Amei cada segundo. As vozes que ele faz, a cadência no seu tom, os sons que muitas vezes são descritos e que ele interpreta de forma tão engraçada. Foi mesmoooo uma experiência única e… maravilhosa! (E sim, uso a palavra maravilhoso muitaaaaaaas vezes quando me refiro a este livro. Não há como não o fazer.)
Quando terminei e atualizei no Goodreads, escrevi: “E terminei as melhores 8 horas, 32 minutos e 2 segundos de sempre. Os melhores 17 capítulos de sempre. Vou sentir a falta deste livro horrivelmente…”. Isto é tão verdade ainda hoje. Sinto tanto a falta desta experiência que só quero que chegue o próximo livro para mais uma vaga de novas experiências.
Recomendo, recomendo, recomendo… Nunca vou poder recomendar-vos o suficiente. Leiam o livro na sua língua original, leiam esta edição e ouçam o audiobook."
959,960,5,"One chapter and I’m already in for the magic. Sorcerer’s Stone has that impact, it both makes me go back in time and grabs my interest as if the story were new to me. As much as the nostalgia is strong, the truth is this first adventure delivers a great story and well-crafted characters and since I already know how everything ends, it’s amazing how clear Rowling had her ideas and how she was going to land them, the amount of details that count for the epic finale are impressive. It´s such a perfect welcome to the reader, there is a kid in me that will forever be waiting her letter.

Intentare ser lo menos posible e ir al punto.



Tengo mucho sin releer Harry Potter, de vez en cuando abro alguno y vuelvo a pasajes que quiero recordar, pero siendo sincera estoy más familiarizada con las películas porque es más fácil verlas y por eso precisamente es que me sigue sorprendiendo la cantidad de detalles que le da Rowling a su historia una vez que me puse a releer de verdad.

Wow, rereading a book with the knowledge of what's going to happen is really awesome! I got to catch on things in the beginning that I never did before. I am not sure if this is my first or second reread, but when I first read this, I was still in grade school and I didn't think the same way that I do now. But I must say,

Yes, it's a bit juvenile, but it's written for kids anyway. And even now that I am reading this one as a teen, I cannot disregard that Yes, art - I definitely loved J.K. Rowling's writing style with this one!

haha! Of course I knew how things were going to work out in the end, but I can imagine how those who haven't read the book yet can be misguided.

It cracked me up when Ron told Neville, ""Yeah, but not to us."" My second favorite is when the trio each had a certain ""job"" to complete in the end, so that each of them was useful, and it wasn't just centered on Harry."
961,962,5,"I've read all the books twice, some three times. I remember years ago when I mailed the first three books to my new nephew, Quinton. My brother-in-law, Terry, and his wife, Libby, had decided to raise Q, her grandson. Libby said the books were a little “old” for him and would have to be read aloud; but if I really wanted to send them, I could go ahead. Unfortunately, my sister-in-law, Libby, got a terrible flu about the time the books arrived on their doorstep.

To appreciate the rest of the story, you need to realize my brother-in-law’s favorite hero is “The Duke.” As in . Terry is nothing, if he’s not a man’s man, and when we play the “lines from a movie” car-riding-game, all his are from JW’s movies.

Due to Lib’s infirmity, Terry decided to take on the duty of nightly story time, and graciously agreed to read this first book until Libby got well enough to take on this “woman’s” responsibility. After almost a week, Libby emerged from her sick bed and, when bedtime came, asked Q where they were in the story. My big, strong, manly brother-in-law said, “Ah…that’s alright. I've got this one.” And he proceeded to read all the rest of the books in the series too! My sister-in-law said it came as no surprise to her when the books became a nationally best-selling phenomena; she knew something was up way before then.

Re-read via audio while traveling the week of February 21 – 23, 2012: I loved Jim Dale’s narration of this delightful book and was happy I finally got to listen to his rendition. His inflections and tones are pitch-perfect, elevating an already engaging book that is a wonderful listen for any age."
962,963,5,"OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS



I just can't give this book less then 5 starts, it deserves a thousend, omg, this book brought tears to my eyes. And I know that I got a whole different experienced because I already know everything, I am sure that I woulnd't react the same way If I knew nothing.

First of all, I don't think that my mind would've be able to imagine the greatnes and magical aspects of this world as clearly if it wasn't becase I saw the movie. And see it with my eyes. Best adaptaton ever! no matter the green or blue eyes shit.

My heart omg, the character Hardid is jusr heartbreaking, I am in love with everything on this book, maybe thats why I did not see many flaws on it.

Okay Hermione, I wanted to hit harry and Ron because of the way they treated her sometimes, they were rude, she is so selfless and sweet and she just cares about everyone. ♥ I mean, at the end when she won that 50 points and she cry!!!! I cried too, to be honest.

Harryyyyyy!!! oh harryyyyy I am so glad he found friends and omg his parents, I cried like 5 times for him, not ugly cry people, just a tear or two....

I like Ron too, but the twins take the Weasley's trophy, HANDS DOWN. Can't wait to read more about them, although I know that I will be DESTOY at the end, I will loose it even if I already know.

I don't know what else to say, I am in love, there is nothing compare to this. bye.

963,964,5,"Hello. My name is Stina. I have a part of my bookshelf dedicated to Harry Potter things including three wands, three first editions (I have to thank my mom for standing in line in the early two thousands for getting them), and some random stuff that I got in London. I have a Pottermore account and I am a proud Ravenclaw. I have seen each and every Harry Potter at least ten times. I know how to play Hedwig's theme on my piano.

But I haven't read all of the Harry Potter books.

SHOOT ME. I KNOW. Don't get me wrong, I haven't boycotted the books or anything. Here's the story; small eight-year-old Stina gets a Harry Potter book, and then the second, and then the third, and then starts the fourth one but her dad comes in and tells her not to (I can't remember why). I don't. Years later, when the last movie is about to come out, an older Stina rushes to go read the last book, completely ignoring the three books that she missed.

That is the story.

This became so blatant the other day when I was watching the fourth movie (my favorite, by the way) and my sister said out loud ""oh, this part is so embarrassing in the book"". In normal cases, I would be able to go ""RIGHT?"" and just as I was about to, I realized the sad fact that I hadn't read it. So I rushed to order a full set of the books (in English; we already had them in Swedish) and here I fucking am.

There's the backstory. Not that you asked.

I forgot how rushed the plot is in this book (though it doesn't take away from its charm) because I guess Rowling wasn't sure how it would turn out? If I recall correctly, and judging by the size of the following books, I reckon she takes more freedom to describe things more.

Rushed plot aside, this holds up really well, even for an old soul like myself. GO HARRY POTTER.

Also: I forgot how much I love Neville."

""There will be books written about Harry. Every child in the world will know his name.""
And indeed we do.

I normally begin a review with a brief synopsis of the book but this is Harry Potter and as its widely known I'll skip this step. Instead, I would like to talk about what this book means to me (also there are quite a few reviews out there and I do no think I could add something different). My birthday is coming up and it has me feeling nostalgic. I first read 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' almost 20 years ago. This was my first full length novel I tackled on my own and it was the book that made me fall in love with reading so there are plenty of wonderful memories attached to this work. Everything from the banquets in the Great Hall to the Quidditch matches captivated me and it has not lost its hold after all this time. I've outgrown so many things but the HP series is one that has grown with me (thanks so much for that Ms. Rowlings!). J K Rowling came up with the premise for this book after going through a divorce, becoming a single mom and struggling financially and produced a work that evokes so much happiness. I continue to love her books now even more that I did as a child. They are just magical.

Side note: As any responsible adult, I have taken the quiz to be sorted out into a house and it came up Ravenclaw. Just wanted to share that."
965,966,5,"My Harry Potter journey began with the movies actually! I was in class 4 or 5, when my father brought home the very first movie, the Philosopher’s Stone. So I started watching and I just became a Potterhead!!

Yeah, just like that! I can still remember the feeling of seeing Harry entering into the magical world of Diagon Alley, his glaring eyes seeing Hogwarts for the first time, those moving staircases or the golden trio walking towards Hagrids hut! I used to have goose bumps! Well, I still feel the same!

So, that was the beginning. I didn’t know much about the books back then as the ‘internet’ thing was not so available at that time. Eventually I knew about the books from newspapers (Newspapers are life saviors!) and literally insisted my father to buy me the books. He agreed.

I started reading the Bangla translations and those were quite awful! So baba bought me the English ones as well (He never says ‘no’ to me about books ^_^ )

The magical journey continued and I kept on reading. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Luna, Neville, Ginny, Fred, George, Draco, Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall…..these names still do magic on me!
As I continued reading, I understood that many parts of the books were skipped in the movies and this encouraged me more to read the books!

There are some books which make you feel at home and Harry Potter series is one of them for me. I literally feel good whenever I open these books and see those familiar lines. Anything about Harry Potter makes me happy! Yeah that’s how a Potterhead should feel! :P

I cannot thank J. K. Rowling enough for making my childhood so magical! <3

Potterhead forever…."
966,967,5,"Warning, this review has spoilers for this book and the entire series.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is a brilliant book and the start of a world changing series. The Harry Potter series is a big part of my life and influenced my childhood. I probably will not be able to add anything that has not been said before. I also won’t describe the story as almost everyone must know it by now and if not where have you been hiding the past 15 years? While the writing is not bad, you can tell the Rowling has improved as the series went on.

One pet peeve I have with this book is that it is not called The Sorcerer’s Stone but The Philosopher’s Stone, that’s because philosopher’s stone has lots of lore and myth surrounding it and I am not sure why they changed it for America. One thing I discovered, and probably only British people will get this, but when reading this book did anyone else have Stephen Fry’s voice narrating it to them?

Harry is a kind and brave person and I like that even after years of abuse and neglect by the Dursley’s he has not turned out bitter and emotionally scarred. Ron is one of my favourite characters of the series as he is normal, and does not feel he is good enough. Hermione is annoying in this book as she is a know it all and just too perfect.

I love this book and the entire series and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

967,968,5,"همیشه اعتقادم این بوده که هر کتابی زمان خودش رو داره و سن و سال خاص خودش رو و حال و هوای خاص خودش رو میطلبه
چند سال پیش خاله ام که در نوجوونی به رمانهای کلاسیک عاشقانه مثل برباد رفته و ... خیلیییی علاقه داشت، در نقد سلیقه نسل ما گفت که هری پاتر رو برای خوندن قرض گرفته ولی حالش بد شده بس که مزخرف بوده!!! دقیقا نقدی با همین شدت و حدت :))
خیلی وقته که تصمیم داشتم سری هری پاتر رو مجددا بخونم هم به خاطر جذابیت فوق العاده ای که تو همون دورانی که میخوندم برام داشت و شاید بشه گفت اولین کتابی بود که منو میخکوب خودش میکرد که بی وقفه بخونمش، هم اینکه بسیار کنجکاو بودم که آیا حالا که سن و سال تغییر کرده و حال و هوا هم بسیار متفاوت از سری اوله، باز هم برام جذابیتی داره یا نه؟!
تصمیم کبری من بالاخره به سرانجام رسید و یه نسخه پی دی اف هری پاتر و سنگ جادو رو برای تایمهای بیکاریم در محل کار گرفتم.
بسیار سورپرایزم کرد این تجربه ولی بیراه نگفتم اگه بگم به همون اندازه اولین سری یا حتی خیلی خیلی بیشتر منو مجذوب خودش کرد. بسیار لذت بردم و اصلا گوشت شد چسبید به تنم :))
مثل همون سری اول با لحظات ناراحتیش ناراحت شدم، با لحظات پر تنشش مضطرب شدم و در آخرین صفحات کتاب بسیار ایموشنال شدم و مثل همون 15 سال پیش چشمام نمناک شد.
یه سری حس ها و یه سری تجربه ها، یه سری کتابها، به تناسب هر شخصی البته، براشون جاودانه اند و پر لذت!
خوشحالم که حالم از شدت مزخرف بودنش بد نشد:))

968,969,5,"It's Harry Potter, so obviously 5 stars.

It's interesting with every reread how many things you forgot and how different you see many characters.
For example, I don't really like Harry. In the 5th and 6th book, this disapproval is immense, but I also noticed it here a few times. He is often quite annoying and never thinks about his actions, a thing I hate.
I love the twins. Every scene they're in is so heartwarming and makes me happy.
I loathed the Slytherin hate in this one. I didn't remember it was that much. I knew that Hagrid said, all bad/dark wizards were in Slytherin and the thing with the House Cup at the end. Ugh, I hate that part and I always want to vomit. But I didn't remember how often mean things were said about the Slytherins, like everyone in every house other than Slytherin despises them. Nobody likes them and they're the only ones that are so mean.
Sure Draco is a bully, but some of his lines are gold.
Like:

I laughed so hard and you can't tell me if Ron or Harry said something similarly good as that, you wouldn't have cheered. I mean, if Harry or Ron do something it's okay, but if Draco does the same it's all horrible.

Nevertheless, this is a masterpiece and you all know it."
969,970,5,"4.5 out of 5 stars.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone contains a fantasy world full of wizards, Muggles, unicorns, centaurs, goblins, ghosts and many more awe-inspiring creatures. The Harry Potter universe is a universe with a variety of terms unknown to the reader, however, as the novel progresses the reader gets familiarised with the terms and somehow seems to grow fond of them.

J.K. Rowling's writing style is impeccable. It contains depth, humour, honesty and humanity. Rowling shows the reader the world from the eyes of an almost-eleven year old, and after his birthday the eyes of an eleven year old boy.

The story is simple yet fantastic and amazing. It is realistic and imaginative. The characters have depth, there is character development. Overall, there is nothing wrong that I can point out. I simply love this novel to bits."
970,971,5,"It was such a joy to re-read this book!

I realized again that one of the things that makes this book so special is the way that Rowling doesn't 'explain' things, but lets the reader wonder and discover the meaning of it later in the book. One small example: the first time the term 'Muggles' is mentioned (in the very first chapter, during the conversation between Dumbledore and McConagall): no explanation given. Another thing Rowling does better than most is the way she plants her clues. You don't even realize it's a clue until much much later.
Not (over)explaining things is especially rare in fantasy novels where the reader encounters a strange, unknown world and in many books a lot of explaining is done which makes for bad reading (especially in dialogue!). Rowling, however, can manage without it. (And mind you, her book was originally written for children and YA). And I've read so many books (not only crime fiction) in which you could see that something is an important clue right from the start.

Rowling, however, rightly trusts the reader's willingness to go along for the ride. In other words, she takes the reader seriously.
Sometimes I wish more authors (of all genres) would read Harry Potter, just to see how it's done..."

Es muy difícil hacer una reseña ordenada de este libro porque ¿que voy a decir yo que ya no se haya dicho de los libros de Harry Potter?

Iba a ponerle una estrella menos, lo admito, por todo este cuento nada épico al principio a mi parecer (pero claro, muggles al fin) pero a medida que todo fue tomando forma cambie de opinión porque hasta el último párrafo no dejó de gustarme. Me encariñe tanto con los personajes: Harry, Hermione, los Weasley, los profesores, incluso Draco Malfoy y su pandilla. Y esa imaginación tan desbordante que posee J. K. Rowling, por Dios ¡Esa mujer sabe como crear! ¡Se merece cada uno de esos fans y seguidores de esta saga! Impresionante.



No tengo mucho más que agregar, porque como dije, las palabras quedan cortas. Seguiré leyendo esta saga por supuesto y recuerden, nunca es tarde para empezar Harry Potter. Llegó mi hora, y os está esperando pacientemente a cada uno de quienes aun no se adentran en este mágico y fantástico mundo."

Alors la, je suis très contente de m’être plongée dans cet univers quand j’en avais vraiment envie. Bien évidemment que j’ai aimé, c’est Harry Potter. Je sais meme pas si un avis développé serait intéressant puisque tout le monde connait ce monstre de la littérature. L’univers est super prenant des le debut, avec une atmosphère bien a elle et les aventures des personnages sont addictives. Outre ça, la seule chose que je pourrais ajouter c’est que selon moi, il n’y a pas d’âge pour lire Harry Potter. Ce n’est pas parce que c’est une saga « jeunesse » qu’un adulte ne peux pas la découvrir pour la première fois. Ça ne fait pas du tout enfantin, mais plutot complexe a vrai dire. Je me demande vraiment comment jk rowling a sorti tout ça de sa propre imagination. Le monstre que cette saga est devenue lui fait bien honneur. Je regarderai tous les films une fois la saga terminée, mais la je vais me plonger dans d’autres histoires pour revenir à Poudlard lorsque l’envie me prendra"

""Harry Potter has never played a sport while flying on a broomstick. He's never worn a Cloak of Invisibility, befriended a giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny cupboard under the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in ten years.

But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter."" (From Amazon)


I love this book and series...it is great for kids all the way to adults. Harry Potter is one of those kids that a reader can relate to and like. He has loyal friends and a group of quirky and caring teachers that allow him to shed the loneliness of his years with the Dursleys."
974,975,5,"Turbūt daugelis neįsivaizduoja savo vaikystės-paauglystės o gal net ir dabartinių laikų be Hario Poterio. Paauglystėje taip apat skaičiau pirmąsias tris ar keturias dalis, bet neužteko užsispyrimo viską skaityti. Taigi, su vaikais nusprendėme, kad vakarais skaitysime HP.


Pirmoji dalis pasakoja kaip Haris Poteris gauna kvietimą į Hogvartso burtininkų mokyklą. Iki tol jis gyveno siaubingą gyvenimą pas Durslius, savo mamos sesers šeimą. Hogvartse susipažįsta su Roniu ir Hermiona, draugais, kurie lydės viso mokslo metu. Sutinka ir Draką Smirdžių, amžiną savo priešą. 


Tai įtraukianti istorija su daug magijos. Rašytoja kuria unikalią aplinką: burtininkai, raganos, raganiai. Hogvartso koridoriai, ir visa aplinka. Be galo įspūdinga. O kur dar visi stebuklingi įvykiai... 


Skaitydama nejučiom lyginau su filmu, kurį mačiau ne kartą. Nors filme dekoracijos įspūdingos, vis dėl to, knyga man patiko labaiau. Romane daugiau detalių, daugiau smulkmenų ir įvykiai rutuliojasi ne taip greitai. Taip, filmai labai tinka greitam istorijos suvartojimui, tačiau knygos - tai tikrasis mėgavimasis."

LOVE THIS BOOK! Seriously I cannot even express how much I love this book. This book sprouted my entire love for reading. It was the first book I ever read that I actually really really loved. Before HP there was nothing.
Only my second time reading it which is shameful but I'll be re-reading this for the rest of my life <3

Things I noticed in my re-read:
- There's actually a chunk of the book dedicated to Hagrid taking care of Norbert and smuggling him off to Charlie. That's where they get into trouble from McGonagall and get detention
- Omg Peeves!!! <3 And the Bloody Baron!!! Characters that didn't make it to the movies
- Snape is overprotective of Harry because Harry's father James actually saved Snape's life so Snape feels that he owe's Harry one lol and he hates James and Harry so he wants to save him and live in peace
- Dumbledore was actually the one that gave Harry the invisibility cloak not Sirius"
976,977,5,"Oh my! What a delightful journey back to childhood..

Over the years, I have always gone back to these books, read a few favorite chapters, closed it and came back to it few years(months/days :p) later again.. It was always a pick-me-up read. But I never did a complete re-read of the series. And what seems like, half the book community doing it, I felt like kick-starting my own series re-read..

All through the book, while I was lost again in the pages and the story and the portal to the magical lands, the me kept trying to be, , and find criticisms/plot-holes etc..
There are quite a few to be sure.
But the child in me gave in, and by the end of the book I was a mushy teary eyed ball of bittersweet joy!

I do not know why I waited so long to give a full re-read.

It was magical nonetheless.
Hogwarts and these books, this world will always be a home for my childhood to live and thrive forever..

977,978,5,"I won't say much about the book itself as it is my third time reading this book. It was great to be back in the wonderful world Rowling developed, I felt at home immediately. I forgot a few things, and remembered so many little things.

When I was holding the illustrated edition in my hands for the first time, I was speechless. While reading this book, I was speechless. Whenever I will have a look at this book again, I will be speechless.
The illustrations by Jim Kay are an absolute masterpiece. This starts with tiny illustrations within the text and ends with mindblowing two-pages illustrations.
I also liked that he didn't get himself influenced with the movies and everything felt new and unique. Especially the characters look nothing like we know from the movies.

That were many words for being speechless about this book. This book will get a special place in my home and I will have a look at it many more times."
978,979,5,"April 3, 2023 - kicking off my fourth or fifth time through this series, largely inspired by the podcast “The Witch Trials of JK Rowling”. If you haven’t listened to that podcast, you should. If you haven’t read these books, I don’t even know what you’re doing on this app. You’re like a food critic who’s never eaten bread.

One cool note: Rowling talks in the podcast about how we are tempted as humans to paint people as purely good or purely evil, but reality is never that simple. This is why she creates a character who we want to be purely good (Dumbledore) and gives him flaws, and a character who we want to be purely bad (Snape) and gives him redeeming qualities. Really noticed how she did that this time through book #1. Don’t ever tell me Harry Potter lacks depth.

Third time through, HP is pure gold. In deep ways and in shallow ways. This is good story telling. If you love books enough to have a goodreads, and you haven’t read this book, idk what u doin"
979,980,5,"This is a wonderful gift edition of the first Harry Potter novel. I purchased this for my 11 year old son, who has never read the Harry Potter books and he was immediately attracted to the cover, where Hedwig flies, golden and utterly eye catching, above the Hogwarts Express. Full of glorious illustrations, this edition brings Harry Potter’s world to life.

I think makes a wonderful present for any reader and is also perfect if you want to read the book aloud at bedtime to a younger child. Everything, from the cover to the quality of the paper and the ribbon bookmark, has been designed with care. This really is a glorious edition of a, now classic, children’s book and will grace any child’s bookshelf."

I've heard about the Harry Potter series for years but was never really interested in reading it until my big sis picked it up a few months back and recommended the first one to me. I didn't really think I'd like it but as soon as I picked it up I just couldn't put it down! I've heard that J.K. Rowling went to several different publishers before one would publish this awesome book, all I have to say to that is the publishers that turned this fantastic read down where insane!

984,985,5,"All I can say is I’m sorry that it’s taken me my entire life to finally enter this wonderful world of wizardry. I was one chapter in, and Stephen’s Fry narration had already left me baffled as to why it took me so long. The depth that Rowling has gone to create such a palpable, exciting world is incredible and Fry does an amazing job bringing her story to life. Yes, it is rather child-like, but they’re a bunch of eleven-year-olds after all. Oh how I regret not reading this sooner - I would have loved experiencing such a magical, exciting world as a child. Nonetheless, this book left me in a state of juvenile euphoria. Onto the next one!"
985,986,5,"Harry Potter is one of those books that will always make you feel like coming home after being away for so long. A part of my heart will always belong to this world. This first instalment is a great introductory to the wizarding world and meeting all the characters. I enjoyed it thoroughly as an adult. Maybe appreciated it more than when I was younger. Can’t wait to start reading the next books. It was cute and lighthearted in a lot of ways. Then you will come to see the characters growing up and the plots get more adult as well.

disclaimer: I don’t not support JK Rowling or any of her transphobic views. Dobby the free elf can be labelled the author of this series thank you very much."
986,987,5,"Read the illustrated edition this year as a read-aloud with the kiddos. The Jim Kay illustrations totally bring this book to life for the littles and are completely gorgeous (great for adults also!!). I mean, an adult probably isn't going to *carry around* this book as their sole read because it's rather large, heavy, and unwieldy. But, definitely get a copy for your shelves if you are a HP fan, because it is a wonderful book to read at home, snuggled under a blankie, with your sweet kiddos piled next to and on top of you."
987,988,5,So I'm currently on this journey to listen to all of the Harry Potter series on audibook and so far it's been great. I always get amazed at the fact that I seem to learn something new every single time I re-read this series. Jim Dale does an amazing job and it's really interesting to dive back into this world. I'm pretty sure I'll be doing a full audiobook review of this either this week or sometime next week. If you haven't had the pleasure of listening to these books on audiobook I would definitely recommend getting to them soon!

I remember the first time I ever read this book. I was Harry's age. I was shaking in fear at some scenes,

This series is without a doubt the most precious and important to me, and there will never be too many re-reads. :)"
991,992,5,"Always a solid read, and rereading it 18 years later doesn't change a thing, except now I see more than I did when I was a kid reading it for the first time, and the layers and foreshadowing of events in later books just proves how brilliant J.K.

আমি জানি এবং মানি যে বই চলচ্চিত্রের চেয়ে অনেক গুণ বেটার। তারপরেও একসময় বইয়ের পোকা থাকলেও এখন আমি যাকে বলা যায় সিনেমাখোর। সিনেমাখোর হয়েও হ্যারি পটার সিরিজের সব গুলা মুভি দেখা হয় নাই এখনো। এই সিরিজের এতো ফ্যান্ডম, তাই ভাবলাম সিরিজের সবগুলো মুভি দেখবো। ঐ যে প্রথমে বললাম চলচ্চিত্রের চেয়ে বই বেটার,তাই চিন্তা করলাম আগে বইগুলো পড়ে তারপর মুভিগুলো দেখি। তাই পড়া শুরু করে দিলাম। কেমন লাগলো?
এক কথায় 'Spellbinding'."
993,994,5,"I don't know what drew me to read this book again between all the new books that were waiting on my shelf, perhaps it was a love spell ;) I quickly returned to my nine-year-old self when reading this book for the first time and discovering an exciting world filled with magic, mysteries and friendship. This was probably one of the most treasured books of my childhood, and it definitely had influence on my decision to become a writer. So much fun to read again as an adult!"
994,995,5,"Am I the last person on Earth starting this Series? Probably yes.
I thought I was too old and too late to appreciate Harry but guess what? I was not!
I loved this first book, I was immediately drawn to J.K. Rowling's writing, characters and world-building. Very much impressed. This isn't child's stuff at all. Her magic worked on me and I'm ecstatic.
I continue with the next installation right away."
995,996,5,"This book blows me away each and every time I read it! I love how it takes me to a new world and quickly takes me back to my childhood! This will forever be my favorite series!

Reread (2/10/2018)- Just finished the illustrated edition and loved it so much! This world never seizes to blow me away!"
996,997,5,"Its been a couple of years since I last reread this book and this series.

There's literally nothing I could say that hasn't been said hundreds of times before.
This book series made me the person I am today, without Harry Potter I don't even know if I would like to read in the first place.

Harry Potter will forever be a 5 star series for me."
997,998,5,"Review for the illustrated edition:

Re-read again!
The book was as magical as before. The illustrations were wonderful and made re-reading this book even more fun and magical. I love HP books even more every time I read them. Reading this book is a good way to end this year



A re-read and truly loved it"
998,999,5,"Loved revisiting this book! Such a magical book with all the feelings! I look forward to continuing my rereading journey with this series.

Hagrid always makes me smile. Hermione, Fred, and George make me laugh. Malfoy gives me a headache. And Dumbledore touches my heart with the brilliant quotes. I love meeting these characters all over again in my adulthood. :)"
999,1000,5,"I mean, obviously, I've read this before. I just finally reread it through the illustrated edition. Am I upset that there wasn't an illustration of the potions challenge so that all the little nerd kids (aka me) can't solve the riddle for themselves? Yes. Is that all I'm upset about? Pretty much. (Just wait until book 3 comes out and we get portraits of Remus and Sirius. *skull emoji*)"
1000,1001,5,"a couple weeks ago my housemate and I convinced our other housemate to sit down and watch all the Harry Potter films (which she had never seen before).

and for the first time in a very long time it gave me the inspiration to begin rereading the series. so yay! I missed the HP word and JK’s incredible writing"
1001,1002,5,"There are those books that have come into my life at just the right time. I actually saw the first movie as a freshman in college in the theater and knew I needed to read it. That summer, it was my saving grace. I bought it from an independent bookstore in my hometown and it kept me motivated. I’ve loved Harry Potter ever since. Sharing them with my girls now has been a great experience."
1002,1003,5,"Ця чудова історія не захопила моє серце і не стала моєю, я не очікую листа з Гоґвортсу і не марю зустрічю з героями. Але це справді було захоплююче читання, сповнене магією та любов'ю, і я з радістю продовжу своє знайомство з Гаррі та його друзями. Нарешті я зрозуміла, чому стільки людей обожнює цю серію і чому вона для них така особлива. А от для мене це просто цікава і красива казка."
1003,1004,5,"⭐️⭐️5⭐️⭐️
Relectura de Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal en la maravillosa edición de Salamandra con diseño e ilustraciones de Minalima.

Obviamente me ha vuelto a conquistar como cuando la leí hace años; una historia increíble y fantástica de la que no me cansaré nunca.

La edición es absolutamente perfecta, una auténtica obra de arte."

Πόσο χαίρομαι που δεν είχα βγάλει τότε την ετικέτα με τις τιμές!
Ευκρινέστατη και με μαύρα γράμματα που δεν ξεθώριασαν...

Δωδέκατη ανατύπωση: Οκτώβριος 2001
Πιάνω στα χέρια μου και πάλι 19 χρόνια μετά το παραμύθι των παραμυθιών,
γιατί ήμουν σίγουρη για την αίσθηση θαλπωρής που θα μου προσφέρει.
Η επιλογή με δικαιώνει!"
1005,1006,5,"26/7/23 RELECTURA
Como me gusta Harry Potter y como me gusta la narración de Leonor Watling. Comencé ha re escuchar este libro con mi hijo mientras volvíamos de vacaciones, y me ha encantado disfrutarlo con él.
------------------------
Junio / 21
Estos audiobooks me están fascinando, es que Leonor Watling narra genial así que he vuelto a comenzar la saga, y con muchas ganas"
1006,1007,5,"“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realise that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign… to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection for ever. It is. In your very skin.”"
1007,1008,5,"[re-read #1 : 16-17 November, 2022]
------------------------
My God, this was refreshing.

What was more refreshing than the magic itself, was J.K. Rowling, as a fantasy author, actually planning the plotlines for her whole series from the very first book! The foreshadowing was GORGEOUS!"
1008,1009,5,"I re-read this series once a year or so, usually during winter. This year I decided to give the audio books a try and I'm so glad I did. Stephen Fry's narration is just perfect, it made an already amazing book just so much more enjoyable."
1009,1010,5,"Just finished re-reading via the Harry Potter at Home Audio Book series! Definitely would recommend checking them out! Woopi Goldberg, David Tennant, Stephen Fry & the Cast Members of the Cursed Child were my favorite readers :)"
1010,1011,5,"This time I've read it in English and I liked it even more than the first time when I've read it in German.
I'm really late to read this series, but better late than never :D
And I think I don't need to write anything else about Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, it's just flawless."
1011,1012,5,"What an amazing experience to read this book for the first time.
I'm so excited to read the whole series. Even though I've watched all the movies and they're my favorite, reading the books is a completely different and unique experience."
1012,1013,5,Oh man. Been a while since I revisited the Harry Potter books. It's gonna be awesome! Crazy to read about younger harry and then realize all that happens after this and just the snowball of destruction that follows.
1013,1014,5,"اولین کتاب از سری هری پاتر
سه کتاب اول هم حجم کمتری دارن هم فیلم های خوش ساختی دارن ، اگه حوصله ندارید به نظرم میشه سه فیلم اول هری پاتر رو دید و ادامه اش رو از کتاب دنبال کرد ، چیز زیادی از دست نمی دید"
1014,1015,5,"นี่คือหนังสือเล่มแรก ที่เปิดให้เข้าไปอยู่ในจักรวาลของ ""แฮร์รี่ พอตเตอร์""
นี่คือหนังสือที่เติมเต็มจินตนาการวัยเด็ก
นี่คือหนังสือที่สร้างโลกสมมติอย่างโลกเวทย์มนต์ได้สมจริง และชวนให้มีความรู้สึกร่วมที่สุด
แม้ว่าจะหยิบมาอ่านซ้ำเมื่อผ่านไปเป็น 10 ปี ก็ยังคงสนุกไปกับหนังสือเหมือนเดิม"
1015,1016,5,"The 67th time reading this, and I still fall in love with the trio EVERY SINGLE TIME.
One of the books you wish to forget to read again
I wanna go to hogwarts
why didn't my letter come 2 years ago"
1016,1017,5,"As many times as I’ve physically read the books, I’ve surprisingly never listened to the audiobooks! I’m so happy I decided to give it a go because it’s brought a very familiar story to life in a whole new way! 🪄🔮"
