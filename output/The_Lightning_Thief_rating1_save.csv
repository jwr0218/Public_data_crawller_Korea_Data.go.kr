1,1,"EDIT 09/06/2013:- That's it. I have had my fill of too many stupid, brain-cell destroying comments posted on this review in the past few months asking me to write a 'best-selling book' before attempting to take apart Rick Riordan's writing. As if the exclusive privilege of negatively criticizing a book is accorded only to published writers and not ordinary reviewers/readers.
I do have the right to record my feelings about a book in my review. And it's such a shame that I am actually being forced to put up this edit to make people aware of this fact. If this review hurts your sentiments as a fan, I am sorry I can't help you there. You must grow up and learn to let dichotomous opinions co-exist in harmony on the same page. That is all.

Brutal honesty ahead. Read at the expense of having to respect someone else's views.

---------

What a feeble attempt at recreating the Harry Potter magic! Aside from being highly unoriginal and unimaginative, the book grates on your nerves due to the frequency of Percy's lame attempts at sounding witty. Seriously, I'm supposed to laugh at his observations on the and ?
Not only did the writer not bother racking his brains to come up with a plot or a proper story, choosing instead to recycle key elements of the Harry Potter series, but he also ignored important aspects of a fantasy novel, one of which is the language. To call the narration just bad will be an understatement. Same can be said about the dialogue and the way the plot progresses - it's one cliched event unfolding after another.
The only novel thing about this book is the seamless integration of Greek mythology into a fantasy-based set-up. The 1 star is for that.
And so I'd like to put a premature end to my review because I just realized the futility of writing one of a book I hated."
2,1,
3,1,"I posted a scathing review of this book when I first read it - 13 years ago now! - while I was studying children's lit at uni. I kept getting narky comments from Percy Jackson fans with hurt feelings, so I decided to re-read the book and update my review. I stand by a lot of the things I said, but I've tried to express my views in a milder manner in order to avoid the PITCHFORKS (or should I say tridents, ho ho) from Team Percy.

With all the lofty maturity and perspective gained since 2010, I concede that it's probably not that bad. It's a quick easy read, fast-paced and entertaining, with a lot of wish-fulfillment-type stuff about an underdog kid getting his own back against bullies and singlehandedly taking on a bunch of monsters with great success. I can see why it's popular and I've happily recommended it to students before, despite my personal prejudice! But I still didn't love it, and I maintain that there are some things about it that are annoying.

Comparisons to the Harry Potter series are pretty inevitable considering when the book was published, which the author acknowledged in . Riordan said that Percy Jackson was 'in many ways' influenced by Harry Potter, and went on to defend some of the key similarities as drawing on the same mythology and containing the same universal themes. This is true, and perfectly legitimate. I have no problem with authors taking inspiration from the canon of existing literature - all fiction is essentially derivative, blah blah. I'm not going to whinge that he referenced the same mythological 3-headed dog (Cerberus/Fluffy) or used some of the same themes (hero's quest). The similarities I'm thinking of are more specific details. Things like:
• the trio of main characters includes a special chosen one with green eyes and black hair, his somewhat useless but funny & loyal best friend, and a smart/competent girl with curly hair.
• Percy/Harry has to stay with a horrible mortal/muggle relative (Gabe/the Dursleys) for his protection (scent/blood magic)
• Upon learning that he is special and not just unlucky, he goes to a magical school, invisible to mortals/muggles (Camp Half Blood/Hogwarts), where he is again under magical protection.
• The students are sorted into teams and there's one noticeably evil team (Ares/Slytherin). There's a strong rivalry between the evil team and the team our hero is on, which leads to fierce competition in games (Capture the flag/Quidditch)
• One of the main antagonists (Clarisse/Draco) is from the evil team, and we later find out has a bit of a bully for a dad (Ares/Lucius)
• The hero finds he can understand a language without learning it (Ancient Greek - and also speaking to horses/Parseltongue)
• An ordinary muggle train station takes you to the entrance of Mt Olympus/Hogwarts.
• The main villain (Kronos/Voldemort) has been in a weakened or near-defeated state due to being ripped into pieces but is regaining power
• There is a prophecy saying (Percy/Harry) will defeat (Kronos/Voldemort) - but it could refer to someone else.
• Some very similar phrasing at times, for example in the scene where the mean teacher (Mr D/Snape) greets (Percy/Harry) by sneering ""well well, our little celebrity"". And the term ""half-blood"". Personally, I think he should have gone with ""demigod"", which is both a cooler word AND a more accurate description of what they are.

I'm not saying I think Riordan intentionally set out to rip Harry Potter off. I just suspect he had the book in his memory when writing and subconsciously mimicked some aspects. HOWEVER, I freely accept that others may consider the similarities either coincidental or sufficiently different to render them unique.

Another thing I mentioned in my original review was the link between ugliness and evil. This still stood out to me on a second reading - possibly only because I remembered it and was looking for it. Some examples are Percy's bully Nancy Bobofit, who has ""crooked teeth"" and ""orange freckles like she's been sprayed with liquid Cheetos"" and has a posse of ""ugly friends"", Clarisse is a ""big ugly girl"" who looks like she ""wears a size XXXL shirt"" and has ""stringy hair"" and ""ugly pig eyes"". The Ares team is full of the ""biggest and ugliest kids"", who live in an ""ugly red cabin"" and their table gives ""an ugly cheer"". Percy's horrible stepdad Gabe's last name is Ugliano and he is described as ugly, balding & overweight. In a combat Percy refers to his opponents as ""Ugly One, Ugly Two"" etc. Meanwhile, Annabeth is ""pretty"" with ""curly blonde hair like Cinderella"" and Percy is a ""good-looking kid"" and has a ""handsome"" face. To be fair, this book certainly isn't the only culprit, but I don't think it's a particularly good message. It probably resonates with preteens, at that age they might find it satisfying to have ugliness sneered at without being told it's unkind/unfair.

I still found Percy a bit too effortlessly awesome. He's often described as guessing or instinctively knowing what to do, without having to come up with ideas, especially in battle. Feeling angry causes him to channel some sort of combat mode where he can perform skills he's never practiced, such as when he disarms Luke in training. ""My body thought for me"" he'll say as he ducks a fatal blow then makes a wild unplanned swing with his sword that somehow not only connects but slices a monster in half. He can beat Ares, the actual god of war, in one-on-one combat. He can saunter into the Underworld without any kind of plan, bribe his way in with money and flattery, have a casual chat to Hades, and then escape with his two friends unharmed. He automatically understands Ancient Greek because his brain is ''hardwired'' for it, and can speak to horses because his father created them. He often has a feeling of danger or a sense that something's wrong (although he never acts on this and plunges in anyway, every. single. time.) and guesses or figures out stuff based on VERY scant evidence. I mean yes, it makes sense in the fiction - he's a demigod, so he's supposed to be born with supernatural powers - but I think it makes him a shallower and less interesting character. In general, I thought the action moved on a bit too quickly to leave much time for any deep conversations or character development, but that's a complaint I often have about teen fiction. I think a lot of authors incorrectly assume their audience won't have the patience for a slower and more thoughtful pace.

My final complaint - a NEW one! - was that I didn't buy the underlying premise. The ancient Greek gods are still around but have moved with the times, hide most of their doings from mortals now using 'Mist', and shift their headquarters to wherever the ""pinnacle of western civilization"" is (America, natch) but they've kept all the same customs, weapons, language, building styles etc that they had in Greece. Well, ok, but what about all the gods of other ancient civilizations? Baal, Ra, Thor, Ishtar, Brahma, Shangti - were they also real? Are they other names for the same guys? Why did they choose to go with the Greek theme if they existed before and after that time? It was never explained. Maybe he'll talk about it in one of the next books in the series but I don't intend to read them so I'll never know.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Was forced to read this lame American rip-off of Harry Potter for my children's lit course. Almost everything about it irritated me deeply - the cheesy humour, Percy's effortless awesomeness and lack of any actual character depth or personality, the concept of 'inborn' knowledge like understanding ancient Greek, the constant info-dumps from other characters explaining things to Percy. And how many times did R.Riordan want to push the UGLINESS=EVIL point? Every SINGLE time the stereotypically and pointlessly evil Aries group were mentioned the word 'ugly' was used to describe them, even if a cheer went up from their table it was 'an ugly cheer'. And Percy's smelly stepdad Gabe's surname is 'UGLIano', oh yes very subtle. I wanted to get a pen and paper out and start a running tally of the obvious Harry Potter references - I won't list them because there are TOO MANY TO COUNT, but my favourite was when one of the teachers actually said to him: ""Percy Jackson... our little celebrity""."
4,1,"Badly written and very sexist. Evil is synonymous with ugly and fat. Girls Percy doesn't like are all described as ugly and masculine (and it is made sure that the reader knows that masculine traits in a girl or a woman mean that she is evil).

And you would not think it possible to turn Greek mythology into conservative American nationalism, but Riordan managed even that.

If you are looking a book to buy for a teenager, do get them something else. Most bricks are better literature than this."
5,1,"Now before you jump on my case, one star simple means ""I didn't like it."" Two stars is ""It was ok,"" which is not accurate to my feelings. The Lightning Thief isn't an awful book, it's just not any good. The concept is creative, but the writing is so sloppy, the dialogue so lame/awkward, and the plot so forced, that what you end up with is the most unimpressive Potter knock-off you can manage. I'll be honest, I hate Twilight but I think even that book is better balanced than this one. Riordan is sometimes even offensive. While the adherence to the canonical myth takes liberties which I think are fine, the Greeks themselves get the shaft. The spirit of the mythology is robbed, replaced with a kind of Ami-Greek hybrid that labels the Upper West side the center of the universe. It may sound trite, overly sensitive, but honestly, it really hurts the integrity of the mythos (ha ha) of Riodan's world.
Percy himself is annoying, the characters are stock, the feelings often forced or nonexistant. Fantastic things happen but carry no weight, and the thunder that follows allusions to the great pantheon is cheesy to say the least. I walked out on Jackson a quarter of the way in."
6,1,"Who knew the category of young adult books aimed at boys was such a wasteland? I've been disappointed by Eoin Colfer and now this supposedly award-winning series by Rick Riordan.
The premise is clever but as many other readers have noted, it is pretty much a Harry Potter rip-off. In one scene, Percy (the hero) sees a guard reading a thick book with a wizard on the cover which he thinks must be good because the guard takes a while to respond. Percy himself, we are told, doesn't care for fantasy. Well, he might plead ignorance of JK Rowling but you can be sure the author has patterned his entire series on the boy-wizard books. Whereas Rowling offered young boys and girls the best of fiction and literature, Riordan and Colfer dish up tired, cliched action-packed adventures. The narrator mustn't pause in the action for a second to talk or think too long before plunging his sword into the next monster. Also, Rowling obviously did a lot of research on her subject and it is clear Riordan didn't when we find lazy errors sprinkled throughout the narrative (e.g. he mistakenly calls Nemesis a god instead of a goddess).
Aside from the bad writing, I struggled with the political ideology of this book. Let's leave aside the fact that there are no characters of color. I just finished reading a novel by a real Greek author called Middlesex and it is an interesting comparison between the candid, all-inclusive, racially and sexually diverse elements in that story versus the narrow world of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. But I think the big glaring problem no one has mentioned is that Riordan has some serious issues with women. Practically every woman character is evil. The only two good women are self-sacrificing defenders of the old patriarchic order. Violence against women is not simply tolerated--it is encouraged. Considering this is a postmodern twist on the old myths (incredibly rich, layered myths to which Riordan does an extreme disservice), the reader might expect that we hear about Medusa from a sympathetic perspective or about the Furies' version of their role as defenders of mother-right.
I feel sad for the young boys out there who are making do with this kind of book and its ilk. No wonder they'd rather play video games than read books. With cheap stories like this, it amounts to the same thing. They deserve better."
7,1,"Somebody please tell me that a twelve year old who just saw his mother being kidnapped won't go around making jokes. Okay, I don't mind a few jokes, but i don't want a joke as big as this book. It actually took me over a year, after once starting it, to develop courage to finish it.

The first person account is one of most annoying things in the book, which twelve year old talks like that - I don't think Rick has it to enter psychology of a twelve year old. No wonder the guy in movie wasn't twelve year old; I mean honestly has the author a kid in all his life.

If you ignore for once the little trivia about Greek gods (which I shall criticize shortly), it is just a shameless coping, no, an insult, of Harry Potter series. If anything, it goes on to show, why Harry Potter is more than just a adventure story. Besides the little adventures, HP was full of allegorical references (to real world), wonderful characters and beautiful writing. She had managed to enter the psychology of both children and adults like no one else can. HP created in one a philosophy that can act as basis for a child to form attitudes towards such things like death, drugs, good or evil, hunger for power. This one has nothing of that. There is no way for example, that it would come so intriguing a character as Snape or such wonders as Platform Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.

It is just how timid mind of a gamer would have seen HP - fights and pranks. Just think of it, a monster doesn't die, if you kill it; and will come back to haunt. Isn't that the kind of thing, that happens in video games?

Now the only argument in favor of book was connections it made to Greek goods. Here are four replies that can be made against it:

1. The basic system is stolen from HP - full time school became summer school, Greek creatures rather than magical ones and so on.

2.Anyone in our generation knows about Greek gods, there are video games and movies all over places, and it is internet age friends. Hades actually looks like same character from Disney cartoon series 'Hercules'.

3. This is most important argument, it was stupid. I mean just give it a thought - 'spirit of western civilization', I mean are you kidding me. what about eastern, northern and southern civilizations - do they have gods too? and if these children of gods are so undesired, how come they are called heroes? What about children gods would have with goddesses? Will they be immortal? because in that case, we must have a population explosion of gods.

I normally don't care about logic that much, if it is a good story but it is just nonsense redefined. I mean, I never asked the logic of wands in HP but that was because Rowling made it look real.

Yes, it is a best seller but that doesn't make it a great book, does it? HP fans were hungry for more and so switched to sub-prime authors. And don't tell me that i'm too old to like it, I read children books all the same. I could go on criticizing the book but i don't see any point in doing that.

Instead of reading it, I would recommend reading HP; and if you have read it, read it again and if you have already read it twice; just give it one more reading - it would still have much more in it than Percy Jackson."
8,1,"I'm not going to win myself any friends from Percy Jackson's legions of fans with this review. Remember that it's just, like, my opinion, man. Now, I have harbored a love of Greek mythology since I was in elementary school and I found a book of such in my school library. I loved it so much, I am sorry to say that I stole it! Fortunately the statute of limitations has elapsed on that particular crime. I looked forward to seeing how this material was wielded in this extremely popular series, so popular that even over a dozen years later, my library can't keep any of its 14 print copies on the shelf, not to mention other formats.

First, the good: . Pretty rad name for a sword.

Then, the less good: the low reading level, the poor humour, the tired formula.

I can't fault the reading level on its own; it's not the book's fault that it was below my expectations. I thought a book and series that was such a breakout hit would be on par with Harry Potter in literary appeal. As it is, I found this to be merely a step above early-reader chapter books. I do not consider this a middle-grade book, rather I judge it to be for older elementary children in terms of reading comprehension. But of course, whoever enjoys it is free to do so, regardless of their age. I found it over-simplified, shallow, and devoid of dramatic tension. It is also supremely formulaic. Take the main party; the boy chosen-one, the goofy, underwhelming boy sidekick, and the competent female second sidekick who is the only one who actually worked hard to earn her place. We have seen this arrangement endless times before. The novel's opening and set-up uses extremely tired narrative techniques. The main character lacks any distinctive personality. Action scenes are random, with poor use of the source material. Supposedly humorous sections fall flat. The driving broader threat, that a war between gods would devastate the earth, is mostly told, not shown or felt by the reader, who has to manufacture interest in the characters' success independently. Overall, I thought the writing was lazy. I attribute a large portion of the book's (and subsequent Riordan publishing empire's) success to a powerful marketing campaign, rather than inherent quality.

And last, the questionable or disturbing: for one, Percy labels himself as dyslexic and ADHD, but does not appear to suffer any of the hardships that actual kids with these diagnoses would encounter. This does a disservice to those who legitimately struggle with these. Similarly, the issue of domestic physical abuse was approached far too casually, and

I don't begrudge anyone who has fond memories of this book, or any of the kids who enjoy it, but there are so many significantly better children's fantasy series out there that are vastly more original and that don't dumb down writing for children.

I do caution any parents to be aware of the need for a conversation about domestic abuse (and murder!) if your kids jump on this bandwagon."
9,1,"I read about 50 pages in. Not one character was likable to me, but I was willing to continue UNTIL...Riordan went on his imperialist gloss about 'Western civilization' being the most important in history. Seriously offended my postcolonial sensibilities. I couldn't continue with no characters to like and the author spewing his personal idiocy."
10,1,"If I were to add this book at the top of any list, it would be on a list entitled 'Weird, Random, and Stupid'.

Don't start jumping to the conclusion that I don't know my Greek mythology. I do. And I actually thought this book was going to be awesome.
First off, in my experience, any book with the word thief on the cover must be good (), so a thief sounded very promising.
Second, I've decided I would not jump to conclusions on books before I've even read them (my mistake with series, which I was totally ready to hate simply because everyone else in my class liked them and because Stephenie Meyer liked them).
And third, having recently read for the very first time and still feeling very sad I finished it, I really needed another book series to get obsessed over (I'm actually still reading , but it's in pdf form and frankly I can't stand reading off my laptop).
So it was. I was given two days by the librarian to finish it, which is probably the only reason I did finish it so quickly. I wasn't exactly having the time of my life while reading it.

I just couldn't get around the absolutely mediocre narrative. It literally sounded like an eleven-year-old wrote it (I ought to know, since at eleven I tried writing my own novel and it sounded almost exactly like Rick Riordan). I don't like books that are too easy to read.
I also don't like books that aren't very subtle. As in, where everything starts happening too fast and the protagonist just takes it in stride. I really think this book would've been a little bit more bearable if it had set Percy as already having been a member of Camp Half-Blood. It could've been about Percy being an outcast at the camp of demigods because no one has been able to figure out who his father is. In my opinion, if the author has way too many incredible and inexplicably impossible things to explain to the main character, then they should just make it so that the main character already knows about all of it. This would be the equivalent of Harry Potter growing up knowing he was a wizard and how his parents were killed, and that he would be going to Hogwarts someday. I mean, it's alot to take in already, the existence of mythological monsters and gods, plus the fact that you are the son of one of those gods, without adding to that the fact that you are suspected of having stolen Zeus's lightning bolt. When you write in the fantasy/myth genre and set it in the real world, you slowly adapt your character to the magical world he will eventually have to save and you pit his doom on him.

The other thing that made it extremely hard to like this book was that there were monsters at every single place Percy's trio stopped by. These were the 'Random' parts of the book. How is it that as soon as Percy and his friends get out of one tight spot they immediately end up in another? Given that they couldn't even stop at a burger joint without being accosted by Ares the god of war, or stop at a random garden ornaments' shop without having Medusa as the shopkeeper, and the nearest hotel just happens to be the one that holds kids prisoner for decades with its promise of an endless supply of food and games, I'm surprised Percy hadn't died earlier on in his childhood, along with half the population in Los Angeles.

Aside from all that, the three main characters Grover, Annabeth, and Percy were actually likeable and memorable - especially Grover, who was my favorite character - but they weren't enough to exucse the fact that they were set in a very badly plotted and disorganized mumbo-jumbo of a story that's fooling itself as an adventure with a mythological twist. There weren't any laugh-out-loud moments for me as, again, the writing style was pretty juvenile. There were some overly used elements, like a school bully, and the jerk stepdad. Generally, it was the book equivalent of a 15-minute animated cartoon. Probably only really good for an audience of 10 year old boys. A big waste of my time."
11,1,
12,1,"Audiobook, listened to with my two kids.

The reader for the audiobook did a mediocre interpretation. His two accents can be described as sepulchral or yokel. Greatly disliked.

But the media form is separate from the book and has nothing to do with the author or the story he intended. So for the actual story, I was disappointed by the mosaic of Greek myths and characters being puttied together thickly with plot convenience and thin characterizations. The three main protagonists are often characterized as smart, tough, etc. but it takes them for-freaking-ever to cotton on to the many monsters who are trying to kill them. It's like they wander around all ""doodly-doodly, naive demi-god over here, doodly-doodly"" as some sort of Scarlet Pimpernel act. Except it isn't. They are actually always dumb enough to get caught but luckily smart enough to escape.

Ideological issues:

1. The book goes off the premise that Greek myths are actually true, and the Greek deities and monsters actually exist. Fine, I can suspend disbelief. But then the book relegates the last 2,000 years of scientific discovery to humans seeing what they want to see. ""The earth doesn't revolve around the sun, as science has proven and scientists have been silenced for in ancient times. No, it's totally a god and magic.""

2. Faith in the gods is revered, and blind faith makes you a hero.

3. White-washing the myths. Medusa was not Poseidon's girlfriend; Poseidon forced her in the temple of Athena, for which Athena punished...wait for it...Medusa by changing her into a Gorgon.

4. The Camp's name. Half-Blood. Is that a good idea do you think? At least ""muggle"" is a made-up word. Half-blood is a real pejorative term that I think should not be thrown around.

5. All the gods are dead-beat parents. Percy Jackson loves his mom, but she's been just as bad as all the rest. She married a guy for his smell even though he is abusive? Because it protects Percy? What, no.

Victim mentality, only one possible choice, etc. run rampant in this story. And that's a shame because the point of the Perseus story is that you can make your own choices in life, and you can defy fate and the gods."
13,1,Bruh.
14,1,"I was all set for a fabulous fantasy series, armed with the first 4 of Percy Jackson's adventure books, courtesy of my brother, the fantasy fiend (though I've been one too since my teenage years). I thought the Olympians series would be a cross between Harry Potter and the Amulet of Samarkand. I was gravely disappointed. I admit part of it was the characterisation of my zodiac sign, Aries, as brutish ugly warring types. But fine, I can be all of those things. There were more serious problems with the first book (and no, Maher, I'm not reading the rest).

The obstacles had highly simplistic solutions. Cerebus, the 3 headed dog guarding the gates of Hades, can fobbed off with a rubber ball. Charon, the River Styx boat guard, with money. Etc. Our hero Percy, a demi-god, son of Poseidon and a human, displays no wild Harry Potter intelligence. A certain humour, yes, but nothing even close to Bartimaeus's footnotes. His only motive is finding his (beautiful kind ie perfect) mother. Bo-ring.

He is accompanied on his quest by a dorky buffoon of a satyr and a beautiful wise daughter of Athena. Hello, utterly shameless Harry/Ron/Hermione derivative? And how is a quest this important (preventing war between the three most powerful brothers and gods) entrusted to an untrained half-blood? Oh right, a prophecy. I'm sorry, but that's not good enough.

I kept finding holes in the plot that annoyed me. For eg, when they encounter an eccentric woman, there's this thought Percy has:

""Only later did I wonder how she knew Annabeth's name, even though we had never introduced ourselves.""

Immediately, I thought, oh they're not going to find out who this person is b/c he's STILL wondering later how she knew. Of course, a page later, it's obvious because she's Medusa, Poseidon's ""girlfriend"" and bitter at Athena for breaking them up and turning her into a snake head. They all know perfectly well why she knows. So why, Mr. Riordan, did you write that line? I know you're trying to point out she knows their names mysteriously at first, but it's not so mysterious a second later. Or how about when Ares smuggles something with Percy, and oh so conveniently ""worked some magic"" to make it appear only when it was exactly time. Maybe that's possible in this Olympian world, but then *work* the plot and background information so that the reader understands and believes it when it happens.

I knew by Percy's first early vanquishing of a monster that things were going to go easy for him the whole book, that no supposedly insurmountable problem would foil him for more than a few pages. This was also obvious by his convenient knowledge of all the ancient Greek stories when it's useful for him to know them. This is again something that could have been easily set up in the beginning where he's shown floundering in every school subject. Um, even Latin and Greek. So then how did he learn all that? A genetic disposition?

Anyway, the one good thing is that the plot moves briskly so it's an easy read. On an unrelated note, I hope someone out there writes a series using the Hindu gods and humans and a quest and so on. Then, even if it sucks, at least there'll be brown people and brown customs in it."
15,1,"I didn't get very far in this book before I set it down. The premise might have worked out to be interesting, I didn't read enough to know, but the narrative style was extremely annoying. Every page grated on my nerves. I could only endure one chapter.

Also, I felt that the book was very poor at creating dramatic tension. The main character has a confrontation in the first chapter that is told in the most mundane way possible, even though its supposed to be thrilling."
16,1,"It's not that I didn't like it. It's that I strongly disliked it. I kept thinking, ""I MUST have the wrong book!"" But I did not. I am utterly confused why any adult would enjoy this book. I thought it was extremely painful. I read to page 123 and I refuse to read another page. Simple, Harry-Potter want-to-be, tries to be humorous but is not, I could have written this book in 4th grade. Do NOT recommend."
17,1,"Might write a review about how bad this is at some point. Maybe.

Who knows though. Could happen. Not sure if there is a point though. If you like this kind of book, you're going to read it anyway, regardless. If you don't, maybe you won't.

Tricky."
18,1,"this book was BORING!!! this is most definitely made for kids... the writing was bland.. did not even feel nothing for the characters whatsoever!

This middle grade is loved by everybody but sadly it wasnt for me."
19,1,"I honestly was very, very interested in the book when I saw it for the first time. “Some dude snatched Zeus’ thunderbolt?” how cool is that? But it also occurred to me that on the day I took this book to the cashier, I felt a strange feeling that I shouldn’t splurge my dough on it. I saw a fat kid, noisily whining and pulling his parents’ hand to the bookstand and tried their best to convince them to buy them one and mum was just shaking her head and said, “No honey, I don’t think you want me to spend $8 for you to reread Harry Potter.” And there she pulled the kid with his both eyes yearningly fixed on the book. I was sure he might cry in any moment. I watched the mum and was amazed how people can be so unbearably ignorant. However I put the book back in the shelf and picked another book then walked wistfully to the cashier. Little did I know, the mum is right and my conscience was sending me the right signal to leave the thing alone.

Every day ever since, every time I heard thunder growling, my thought flying straight to that damn book. This is starting to put on airs, I thought. So one day, lunch hour, I went from my office to the nearest bookstore to get a copy. The errand easily became a quest. It was sold out in every bookstore in the area. It seemed the book had successfully appealed to every kid in town therefore the copies of The Lightning Thief was brutally thieved by a legion of little devil thieves. With empty stomach I went back to office empty handed, wasted (because of ghastly Jakarta traffic), and bloody angry. I was angry good, yeah. Then I heard the growling sound of thunder, like the universe was mocking my calamity of the day. So I went to the toilet and screamed as loud as I could: “I HATE FAT KIDS! I WANT MY LIGHTNING THIEF!” Almost surely the guy who’s shitting generously inside the room in the toilet had no idea what the fuck I was getting at and I heard a loud “plonk” when I was about to leave the toilet.

So I dedicated my Saturday and embark on an against-all-odds quest to find The Lightning Thief. I went literally everywhere in Jakarta, but simply they only have the book two to five without the one. While I was driving, the weather was getting thundery just like a bad omen. Then I gave up. The quest failed, the fat kids won. I hate fat kids ever since.
Just recently, I gathered up with my big, big family (not just my mum and my brother but also with my grandpa and ma and the entire range of my mum’s siblings and their kids which sums up to 20 plus in total) for the New Lunar Year. Then I met some of my cousins (which most of them are fat, yes, but at least they are no kids and I love them). Then it might just my luck when one of them asked, “have you read The Lightning Thief?” It happened that he owns the entire series of Percy Jackson books one to five plus The Demigod Files. I had struck a goldmine. So I went back from my grandma’s house, grinning cheek to cheek with a lump of hoard in my car trunk. Couldn’t restrain myself, I read the book that very night with a high, high expectation. And there I was. Apocalyptically disappointed.
First thing that blows from the book was the fact that one spunky kid hero, one tinker girl and one joker boy is out. I mean, come on—it’s Harry Potter! But then I told myself, no, no this couldn’t be, there must be some twist, it can’t occur that this book is a rip off. But then there it went again, Camp Half Blood equals Hogwarts, Chiron equals Dumbledore and so on. Therefore the more I read the more I saw Harry Potter on the pages whisking his magic wand and spelled, “Wingardium Laviosa!” (Mind my spelling, I’m a mundane).

The second thing was that it was ridiculously, unbearably and insufferably American. Now tell me, what’s with George Washington was an offspring of Athena? What’s with Empire State Building is the goddamn Mount Olympus? What’s with the Olympians’ delusion of America as the centre of Western Civilisation—“…where the flame is the brightest”? And the strangest of all, the bloody Underworld is in L.A? So all of us will eventually cruise down to underground L.A when we’re dead? That would be a fucking tragic death. Maybe—just maybe, this was largely what miraculously makes the series a “New York Times Bestseller” and a “National (America) Bestseller”. Those are three American stuffs humping together.

Then I also noticed Percy was pulling off some Hercules’ stunt when he was a baby: strangle a poisonous snake monster to death. That’s plain Hercules. Will this guy stop rip offing?
And next, I noticed this—IM. Ah! Brilliant! The Gods can Instant Messaging each other! Oh wait, it’s supposed to be Iris Messaging. And how? Get a squirting water gun, squirt some water to sunray, get some rainbows, throw some gold coins into the rainbow and there you go—some talking face appears out of the rainbow. That’s crazy. Not in a good way. I imagined, to maintain the rainbow face talking, I got to keep on spraying and make sure the rainbow is still there—while I’m talking to the rainbow. Shit, that’s got to be my most retarded stunt ever.
I can go on with this forever, but hey, let’s be fair will we? Strangely the book was nicely written, stuffed with wisecracks like, “Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.” Now that was good. It was both slick and sweet (and funny somehow). But there were also some letdowns like, “…my mouth felt like a scorpion had been using it for nest.” (The bloody scorpion just keeps getting in the way). However personally I think there are more goods than bads. Thus this is where the one star came from.

But then, that’s it. No more good things came from this book. I’m not sure whether I want to continue with Sea of Monsters. I was angry (again) when I finished the book—I set a high expectation for it, not to mention the fat kids and all the traffic jam I went through—I’d throw it away to the canal in front of my house if it was mine—but no, it wasn’t. Had it was, it would ended up in the darkest bottom of the waterway, collected by the garbage man, thrown into a recycling centre, and finally turned into a nice, 100% acid-free, cream-coloured recycled paper notebook—which is surely posses a sweet better value than what it once had in its previous life. The notebook would be very proud of itself indeed."
20,1,"This review is for the whole series.


Ok, where do I start.
First off, Rick Riordan is a complete AMATEUR. I mean come on, the romance!! Don’t get me started!!!
In every book suddenly, out of nowhere, Annabeth or somebody says something about their feelings. There was nothing to pick up on that any one of the characters has feelings for each other.
In book 4, The Battle of the Labyrinth, out of NOWHERE, Annabeth kisses Percy, and his reaction was pretty much “Oh”. Just such
a-a bland reaction. I mean, the book didn’t talk about what he felt like during the kiss or how he felt about Annabeth!
Same thing with Rachel Dare, when Percy and her were talking he said his “feelings had gotten pretty mixed up the last couple of days”.
His excuse pretty much every time was that he didn’t have time to sort out his feelings!
WHAT?!??! WHAT?!?!!! IF IT’S LOVE, YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME!!!!!
Annabeth and Rachel aren’t the only ones who have so called ‘feelings’, there’s also Calypso in The Battle if the labyrinth.
It’s like, here’s another caring mother figure for Percy, “‘The truth is the gods send me companionship from time to time... They send me a hero I can’t help... just the sort of person I can’t help falling in love with.’
‘Me?’ I asked.
‘If you could see your face.’ She suppressed a smile, though her eyes were still tears. ‘Of course, you’”
Of course you, silly Percy, heh heh, how stupid can you be. But we’re not done yet, here’s Percy’s reaction:
“I can’t.” 😂😂😂
Ok, so apparently the caring mother figure is not a caring mother figure like we thought, but in fact a several thousand years, old woman who has feelings for a teenager.
Go for it Granny.
Calypso must be desperate to fall for Percy, he’s such a goody-goody. I mean, every time he leaves on a quest or something, he’s always like ‘Oh man! I forgot to call my mom! She must be worried sick! I’m such a terrible person to not tell my mom that I’m being chased by monsters and being forced to run! I’m so terrible for not calling her the second I can!’ Blah, blah, blah. We like watching a troublemaker who stumbles into trouble at every turn and makes fun of the situation, but Percy? The guy’s a moron.
Rick, how about you spare us and DON’T EVEN try to write romance.
And it’s not only the romance. His writing style-the way he phrases things is bland, there’s not enough info on the situation, it’s pretty much “‘Hey Percy, can you take out this giant?’ So I take out the giant”
I mean, couldn’t you have explained what it was like taking him out a bit more than you do?!?!! Also the whole idea of celestial bronze weapons vaporizing monsters with a single touch is lame, boring, and honestly stupid!! Celestial bronze is just an excuse for the weak characters to wipe out challenging monsters!!!
Not only that, but, the so called ‘witty’ humor is SO BAD. It makes me SO ANGRY to see this book compared to the amazing Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is AMAZING!!! (I HIGHLY, HIGHLY suggest it).
Also, the goddess Athena, is portrayed as a 12 year-old!! A 12 YEAR-OLD!!?!?!!
You know that old Greek myth about Athena bathing in the forest and a guy stumbles in and googles at Athena bathing? Well that’d be pretty messed if she was 12.
You should’ve thought about that Rick.

And the worst thing about the whole book, listen up here, if nothing else, listen to this, the WORST THING about this book is that Rick writes the book not for action audiences, not for mythology lovers, not even for the fun of writing, Rick writes the books to express his political views. He writes the characters to express his political views. Every character in his book is an environmentalist. They all hate people who tear down trees. Or build anything on an animals habitat. That’s what Rachel Dare’s father is; a businessman who searches for and buys undeveloped land, to build houses and skyscrapers. Also Grover’s whole character’s purpose is too search for the god Pan (the god of the wild and nature) and make Pan fix the world’s pollution! When I read a book I want it to be non-subjective. No politics. I want a book that has fun characters, good romance, out of the ballpark action!
But Rick, you don’t write these books for that purpose. You write these books because you want to tell people that they are wrong for not hugging trees, wrong for living on animals’ land. Maybe the reason why the characters are unoriginal, why the action is boring, why the romance SUCKS, maybe the reason is because you(Rick)didn’t focus on those things, you focused on finding fault with people who don’t share the same views as you. You focused on telling people that their views are wrong if they’re not yours.
So no, I don’t like reading politics in books that are supposed to be fun, because they’re not fun if you spite people who don’t have the same views as you.

On a scale of 0-10, 0 being the worst you can possibly be, 10 being the best you can be (none of the following will get a 10) these are the following features of the book:
Character originality=3
Romance=0
Plot=3
Fun=3
Action=3
Writing=1
Monsters=3

The point I’m trying to make is Rick Riordan is not a brilliant author like every believes him to be, he’s a complete and total AMATEUR. Just because a series or show or movie or whatever is popular does NOT make it good. I mean, sure, the guy’s got an okay imagination, but the writing style, among other things, like the romance and the lack of information and most of all, the politics, makes me want to give this book 0 stars.

If you enjoyed or agreed with this review, please like this review."
21,1,"A billion people like this book, including all of my friends who have read it, so I'm sorry if I insult anyone.
Let me put the good things first. Rick Riordan, at his best, is very funny in a random and sarcastic way, and his plot lines are gripping and fast-paced.
Now for the bad part.
Not to sound pretentious and oh-my-look-at-me-I'm-too-good-for-a-gripping-read-ish, but I didn't like the writing style. The sentences were short, the ideas really not challenging, and the reading level about 5th grade.
I could have lived with that, but I'm a mythology purist, and this is less about exploring Greek mythology than killing/defeating/cracking jokes about/modernizing the Greek gods. Sure, the Greek gods, in real life, would probably have updated to GreekGod 2.0 (new! Togas replaced by Hawaiian shirts and jean capris!), but I'm still a purist, and it seems like an insult to Poseidon to stick him in Hawaiian shirts and capris, and to have Ares turned into an annoying muscly motorcyclist.
Also, Athena pledged never to marry or to have children, and that means no demigod kids, either. So why do we have Camp Athena?
The characters are also stereotyped clones of the main Harry Potter trio with all of the interesting levels of the characters that readers can respect gone: Percy, the typical main character, bold, dashing, and Gary Sue; Annabelle, Percy's wisecracking, knowledgeable female counterpart; and Grover, the lovable but faintly silly sidekick.
This doesn't have to do with The Lightning Thief, but with the Percy Jackson series in general: in the excerpt of The Last Olympian that I read, Riptide, Percy's ballpoint pen/sword ( . . . ) is literally described as ""an arc of destruction."" Because of some spell that's been put on Percy, he can randomly massacre the Land of the Dead's gigantic army and kill everything in sight without any of the bullets hitting him, any of the swords chopping his head off, et cetera. Pretty convenient.
I am picky, though. If you're looking for a good read with jokes, this is a good book for you."
22,1,"Well, this was a mess.

I can see why these books were popular, but my word, it's definitely written for kids.

The characters are flat, they basically do nothing throughout the book. Everything is accomplished for them, so...why do they exist?

Story's pretty boring; it took me a couple weeks to finish it.

So...I don't plan to read the rest of the books, as there are a lot and I don't have that kind of time.

Plus, as C. S. Lewis once said, ""A children's story which is only enjoyed by children is a bad children's story.""

And I completely agree."
23,1,"My apologies to friends who liked this book, but I tried two or three times and have not gotten past page 75. First, I think it is a mistake to use first person narration for a book about a young protagonist. It reads as if it were written by, rather than about, a very young person. Second, it is highly derivative of the Harry Potter book and has -- at best -- only a modicum of imagination or originality."
24,1,"im giving this a 1 star for the following reasons:

1. the author is a z!0n!st
2. the audacity to write a middle eastern-muslim character or at least what percy assumed to be one (the character had an alleged middle eastern accent too) only to end up becoming a vile monster, like are we suprised? and then when talking about the way the character is dressed you refer to her headscarf as “a cursed veil” or “reaching up to undo the WRAP around her head” dont you love the terminology and representation towards muslims in this book 😍
3. and ofc george washington was the son of athena like from all the people, you chose one of the most racist men who took the teeth of slaves to make fake teeth for his own
4. the percy jackson movie with logan lerman was way better than this book and u will not change my mind on that"
25,1,"I know publishers are desperate to find the next Harry Potter, but this is getting ridiculous. This book is unapologetically the story of an American Harry Potter set in a context of Greek mythology. [SPOILERS AHEAD] A boy with missing parents (well, a mysteriously missing Father) finds that strange magical things are always happening to him but doesn't know why. Turns out he's no muggle (I mean normal human), but is part of a secret world of Greek gods and their offspring, and he has dark enemies who want to destroy him. He is whisked away to a secret magical school (I mean summer camp), where he and all the other newcomers are grouped by house (I mean cabin). He quickly makes enemies with the house of Slitherin (I mean cabin of Aries) but he stands up to them.

I could go on with Potter parallels (at one point I actually started keeping a list), but I won't. I might still have enjoyed this book but unfortunately, unlike Rowling, Riordan seems incapable of building any tension or mystery. He's constantly telegraphing his narrative punches so that you can see every revelation miles before it happens. I got bored and gave up on the book.

On the positive side, at least it's somewhat educational about Greek mythology."
26,1,"I took me forever to finish this book. I was hoping for so much more, especially since it seems to be popular with young readers. I felt there was no character development; I knew the characters no better at the end of the book than I did at the beginning. The plot was one predicament after another with weak solutions. It seemed the author was trying to throw as many mythological characters as he could into the story with little reason for them to be there. I thought the premise of the book had real possibilities. When I finished I was just grateful to finally plow through it. I want my books to leave me wanting more. This book really missed that for me. I will not read this author again."
27,1,"For once Goodreads recommendations failed me. The idea itself is good, but everything else just fell flat. The characters lacked credibility and persona and the plot was worn-out. I realize I'm probably not the target audience the author had in mind, but I've read my fair share of children's books/books for young readers, and I can immediately think of dozens of alternatives for this one, books that don't underestimate the (young) reader, books with compelling, well-rounded characters and effortless narration (both of which this book unfortunately lacked)."
28,1,"I hate to be so harsh to a popular series that may get kids excited about reading, but 1 star is for ""didn't like it"", and that is the case for me. The storytelling is weak, the exploitation of ancient mythology unimaginative, and the writing style is poor. There is so much out there better for young minds, and I'm not going to recommend this for my kids. Write me a note if you want to hear more, otherwise I'll just stop here."
29,1,couldn't finish it
30,1,"The plot was rushed, characters were weakly developed. I found certain parts mildly problematic. I see why 4th graders enjoy it but it's a pretty crummy book."
31,1,"First of all, I didn't like the Idea of a civilization's fate being in the hands of twelve years old boy. That made the whole story look stupid to me.
On the other hand, I kind of hoped that the villains would somehow manage to destroy the the western civilization. It really bothered me that the writer talked about western civilization in a way that it's such a sacred thing.
The plot was loose and stupid. (Protagonists tended to accidentally get into some monster's shop and found the next clue there.)
But it was a nice way to get familiar with Greek mythology. I'm about to start reading Homer's Iliad and the Odyssey.
The only character I liked was Thalia, who appeared briefly in a dream."
32,1,DNF at 61% wasn't for me☹️
33,1,THE BEST BOOK SERIES IN ALL ETERNITY A MUST READ FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE PLANET
34,1,dnf
35,1,"I don't see a reason to finish this book, after reading 47% of it. I don't find the story interesting, I don't think the narrative of this book is good and enjoyable; and I don't like any of the characters. Being totally honest, the premiss didn't sound so interesting to me, but I gave it a go because I had the impression that Riordan was this wholesome nice guy, and I got curious. Well, I guess that was not enough as a reason to read this, as he doesn't transmit that in the book at all. There's a tendency in many of the characters to be mean, I guess to make the impression they are cool and witty. Not only that, but I actually find Percy to be quite shallow, as he comments on people's looks often and judge them by that. That thing of calling the Ares kids ""ugly"" and commenting in the (large) size of the shirts that they wear... wh-what?! He gets to the point of mentioning them as ""Ugly Number Two"", ""Ugly Number Three"". So yeh, once again, this is a book where, oh-what-a-coincidence-, the ""mean"" and ""violent"" kids are also not attractive, and are big... aha... ok.

Nothing can save this book for me, really. I'm with the minority that highlights that, even if this is a book for kids, that doesn't mean much at the end of the day. There are so many books written for kids that can be enjoyed at any age, and are beautifully written. There's no excuse for simplifying the narrative as low as this book does."
36,1,"I often wonder if I had a time machine what I would use it for. After reading the first Percy Jackson novel I can safely say I would go back and spare myself the time I took reading this book. I know it's intended for a young audience but that doesn't mean it has to be quite so twee. Not only does it seem to be hugely derivative of Harry Potter, just look at the title for starters, but when it comes to Greek mythology, Rick Riordan has taken so much artistic licence the genre is completely misrepresented. OK, so the dyslexia and ADHD elements are on the face of it quite clever but they hardly bear close scrutiny. The character development is poor, and the plot requires the reader to make a number of very big leaps which make it difficult to suspend the necessary disbelief. All I can say is look at the original Greek mythology and you will see this is the biggest farce of the genre since Brad Pitt's performance in Troy. Harry Potter it isn't. As a fan of Greek Mythology I was hugely disappointed. Like Pandora's Jar, I rather wish the lid had not been taken off this particular offering. Not one to recommend and I won't be reading any more of the series."
37,1,"As an avid reader and one who looks for real beauty in writing, this book was so disgusting that I will NEVER pick it up again! It was so superficial and packed with blockbuster action garbage that basically screams, ""I deserve to be on the big screen!""
I HATE blockbuster novels like this, because very rarely do they have a real story. With a few films that were novel adaptations that I thoroughly enjoyed, (e.g. Watership Down as a film was fairly faithful to the novel and didn't include lame attempts at humorizing the story.) I knew right away that Riordan wanted it to be adapted for the screen, and that is a good feeling to know something like that.
Plus, when did the danger ever stop? Percy's life was on the line every five seconds!
The entire tone of the book was atrocious. I did not see any actual serious tone in here. It was very hard to take seriously.
The entire novel is a joke! Riordan should really be ashamed of himself for writing something as corny and cliche as this."
38,1,"I know there are a lot of people who love this series, but I thought this book was a giant steaming pile. First off, I hated Percy - I thought the author gave little to no attention to developing his character, which in my humble opinion, is a pretty serious miss. Second, I couldn't escape the feeling that this was a Harry Potter rip off - and a poorly written one at that. There are just too many similarities: the child who has special powers (that even he isn't aware of yet), gets shipped off to camp (uh Hogwarts), he happens to have an awkward but loyal red-headed best friend, (and also happens to bleat like a goat while he talks - but that's another rant), the sassy girl who also happens to be part of the trio (Hermione)... I mean, come on.

So needless to say I won't be rushing out to buy the next installments of this series. I love a good YA novel, and I loved Harry Potter, but if you can't bring a unique point of view to the table, don't bring one at all."
39,1,
40,1,I think that this book is hard to understand if you are really not focused on it. I for me it was hard to understand it because there were some parts that had tricky words. This is a book someone with a high reading level would understand this. Overall this book had some funny parts and some action parts. What i mean by that is that there are funny times in some chapters. But there were some action parts when they were on a journey.To look for Percy Jackson's father. I just feel like I would've spend my time reading something else. There were a lot of questions i had that were answered towards the end of the story.
41,1,id buy it physically just to wipe my ass wit the pages
42,1,"um. let's just get this over with.

the good
the premise i guess? the whole 'wise girl' thing was cute so i guess i can understand why people love that bit so much. the camp seemed cool when i had seen tiktok edits and content about it? and i guess most of the good characters haven't been introduced yet so hopefully the series gets better? it must, right?


the writing. oh my god. i literally cannot. i don't even know what it was about it, i just found it so hard to focus on. it probably had something to do with the fact that it's intended to read as though a 13 year old with adhd has written it so maybe that's why. or maybe it was the way that almost every second word seemed to be written with a capital letter at the start due to the amount of greek gods and goddesses they were discussing. but dear lord it was hard to read. also it's middle grade so that would also have something to do with it. also literally what was the reason for it to be set in America. when they were explaining why the gods had moved there the only thing going through my mind was that one sound that goes like ""WHAT THE FUCK IS A KILOMETERRRRR *eagle screech*"". like why did it need to be all ""this is America, home of the brave, land of zeus apparently. whatever, i don't care that much. as if that was the biggest problem. i am also still somewhat undecided on the way that this book handled dyslexia and adhd but i think i've decided that i don't like it. i don't have lived experience of either disorder but i do have experience of being neurodivergent and i feel that one of the most annoying things someone can say to you about it is ""don't let it limit you, it's your superpower!!!"" blech. look, i'm sure that that kind of messaging was really affirming for some kids with dyslexia or adhd in making them look at themselves differently but from an older perspective it definitely irked me. i think the most concerning part was the quote did it occur to no one that it might be a bad idea to include a sentence like that in a book targeted at young kids, particularly boys, many of whom may have been on medication? i feel like it prompts an unnecessary distrust in the medical field. for many people, adhd medication is really helpful so i felt like it was weird to claim that it was some sort of placebo designed to keep young people from learning about the world. but that's a whole other can of worms that i shan't open.


trivialising world war 2. what the fuck guys. to claim that world war 2 was basically all the half-blood kids of poseidon and zeus fighting all the half-blood kids of hades was honestly pretty disgusting. and to say that one of the conditions of hades' defeat was that all the gods had to stop having kids with mortals is even more vile. that was an actual historical event with a death toll in the millions and blatant misinformation about it published in a kids book is just not the way to go. and i know, ""it's not that deep"", but i for one think it really is that deep. call me a snowflake leftie and i will wear that badge with pride. you shouldn't be making ridiculous claims, no matter how serious, about the mass genocide of a people. anyway let's get into the racism. as pointed out by numerous articles that pop up when you search ""percy jackson problematic"", there are only 2 explicit characters of colour in this book. and i can't speak for the rest of the series but in this book, they were both introduced in very weird manners and were both monsters. when medusa first appears she is described as being middle eastern, or at least, she must be due to her modest clothing and spoke with an accent. when charon is introduced it is with the (sarcasm for those at the back) descriptor of his ""chocolate-coloured skin"". guys i thought we had moved past using food descriptors for people!! and apparently he ""had a strange accent - British, maybe, but also as if he had learned English as a second language"". wow. thanks. it goes without saying that of course both of these characters are evil. also after doing a very minor search for charon i was horrified to learn that he had been whitewashed for the 2010 film adaptation of the book. come on guys! that's like no-no number 1!

anyway, i wasted literally an entire day on this book. i sure hope the numerous sequels got better because i will never be reading them. i'm not even tagging this review as having any spoilers because i wish i had known all this before i read it."
43,1,"Dear Percy Jackson fans, I'm very sorry to say that this will a negative review and I beg of you not to read my reviews of The Last Olympian or The Battle of the Labyrinth because those will only hurt your feelings and that's not what I want to do.

If you can't handle what I say please don't read anything beyond here or my other reviews of this series, I just don't want to ruin a series for someone, and if I have then I'm sorry but my minds made up and I'm not one to change it once its made.

Alright let's get started...

Positive rant-



I just don't like this boy very much, he whines, he's a brat straight up and he constantly...no wait I actually like that part.

Another thing, I the Greek gods, just a bunch of wimpy, duck flipping, moronic, evil, twisted, well understated creatures that obviously have no common sense or respect for each other or anyone else for that matter! I just hate them so much.

Percy was bullied throughout the entire book, not having a sense of direction, the lack of any ambition or interest, in fact he was nothing short of maggot in any level of interest in my books!

I respect the author, I really liked his story, he has a good sense of action and twists in a way, but...no, not for me, I am through with Percy Jackson and the Olympians .

Negative Rant-

ARE YOU CRAZY, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU! STUPID LITTLE...OOOOOH WHERE.IS.MY.WAND! I CANT STAND ANY OF THIS, I HAD TO STEP AWAY FROM THE BOOK FOR A WHILE! MOCKINGJAY WAS LESS DEPRESSING THAN THIS BOOK AND THAT IS DEPREEEESSSSSSSING!

I'm sorry but he never wanted this, and Posiden...I'm very disappointed in him, indeed!



I cant...

I can't believe it's a film series....it's going to copy Harry Potter and The Hunger Games, those are good books compared to this.

A best selling series...


I'm done! But before I leave this for good I want to say to everyone who liked this story, ignore my words if you love it enough to not let it bother you, love it with all of your soul, that all I have to say and good luck


J Vera (C) 11"
44,1,"* So I would like to start off by mentioning that irrespective of my personal opinion I don’t think this is an entirely awful piece of literature. Would also like to add that my thoughts are vague as I haven’t read the book in a while, but these criticisms have been sitting with me for at least half a decade now so I think they need to be put out into the world. *

I think the way he utilized Greek mythology and culture was really poor, especially seeing as he has a history related background. I didn’t expect that all mythology would be covered (a LOT of stories to be putting into a series like this) or portrayed in its original complexity but by the same token I did expect that there would be a better presentation of the gods besides what I would like to call an Americanized retelling. I also thought it would’ve been a potentially obvious idea to incorporate modern Greek ideas a bit more to better educate readers on what the actual culture is like today (not to say the book should revolve around it, but wouldn’t it make sense to see Percy alongside a character with a Greek immigrant background given the large influx of Greeks immigrating to America in the later 20th century? Drawing comparisons with modern and Ancient Greek history would’ve been such a creative approach to his narrative, especially given some of the key themes)

This to me doesn’t seem like an anomaly with Riordan’s writing, when reading his other books on Egyptian mythology I found the same, alongside many other annoyed readers at the time. I felt like the idea surrounding the series had so much potential and ultimately fell short of my expectations. I was baffled is to why no one was pointing out the alarming amount of good plot devices left unused here. It's not even necessarily that these are niche ideas, these are common topics in lots of novels of this caliber which discuss culture.

I am aware that the book was written for his kid, and I know the mythology isn’t meant to be the spotlight, but if Tolkien can do it with an imaginary culture, if not several of them, Riordan can afford to do justice to Greek mythology especially considering it’s got nothing to do with his heritage (to my knowledge), and that this is the culture and heritage of millions of people.

I wouldn’t recommend this if you have a love for Greek mythology, and as an obviously peeved history nerd I really, really despise the writing here. Normally I'm able to find the good in something despite its flaws but I'm not even willing to consider that with this series.

Nonetheless, I still congratulate Rick Riordan on writing a piece of work that has left me with an avid hatred for his books almost five years after reading the series."
45,1,"""The gods move with the heart of the West. …What you call ‘Western civilization’… is a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it. You might even say they are the source of it, or at least, they are tied so tightly to it that it that they couldn’t possibly fade, not unless all of Western civilization were obliterated. The fire started in Greece. Then, as you well know, the heart of the fire moved to Rome, and so did the gods. … [They] moved to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in England. …And yes, Percy, of course they are now in your United States. … America is now the heart of the flame. It is the great power of the West. And so Olympus is here.""

Very very concerning ideologies are present in this book. I will not finish and I would never give to a child."
46,1,"The Gods are so powerful, yet they have to hide, afraid that CNN would make them disclose they don't know what laundry detergent is. Or something.

Percy is Riordan. Percy is a good boy, but that does not seem to be enough. And like Percy, Riordan was a good boy, but that wasn't enough to get anything in the Science classes. Lucky for him, the state always lacks guardians to mind the children during English class. So the bar was low enough to get a diploma. Than, because he is a good boy, he knows all the mandatory lectures, including the Greek Mythology.

I have nothing against Riordan. I find his writing skills superior to Dan Brown. And the fact that he sold a lot of books is proof that there is something. But I prefer writers who work more to polish their stories, like say Gaiman."
47,1,This book was recommended to me by a couple different people and the plot seemed intriguing but it was one of the worse books I have ever read. Percy was annoying and unlikeable protagonist. There were times I wished he would have died so I didn't have to read his stupid remarks. The authors attempts to be funny did not work and came across as a middle age man trying to fit in with middle school aged kids. The potential villains were weak and easily defeated. Overall I believe this is a weak attempt to copy Harry Potter.
48,1,"Can't help but think of Harry Potter when you read this. It rips off it pretty bad, giving it a mutilated Greek mythology spin. It's a pretty sad imitation. Like comparing a warm, nutritious, delicious, satisfying (for all ages) meal with a hot fudge pop tart. Shoddily put together and leaves you feeling empty with a bellyache.

Definitely not a YA that can entertain beyond it's target audience of sugar hopped kids."
49,1,"This book was disappointing. It's not YA like the Mockingjay series or Harry Potter is YA (i.e. totally sophisticated and relatable to any age reader). I found the language to be simplistic, the characters to be one dimensional, the situations to be totally predictable, and I had no emotional connection to anything going on in the book. The whole thing just felt really dumbed down. I wonder what the YA audience actually thought of this book."
50,1,"Personally, I don't see why people ENJOYED reading this book. It was only geared towards a specific age of about 11ish to 12ish and since I'm 14 I felt like it was too childish. There are so many better books out there, like The Hunger Games, Nineteen minutes, and Plain Truth. How do you guys think that this is the best book ever? Seriously I don't get it. No offense to anyone out there-I'm not trying to hate on you. I just don't understand what was truly amazing about this book."
51,1,"If you find that you are the type of person who has to finish a series once you have started it I admonish you not to read this book. If you do read it read the first one hundred pages and the last fifty pages. Those are the only worthwhile reads in this book. The rest is contrived, mechanical, and trite. Reread Harry Potter if you are that bored!"
52,1,"Well, at least I've read as much of this as I ever will. I really wanted to like this book because of how much my students like it, and because of how it's getting kids to read and learn about Greek mythology. But the writing sucks. It is absolutely horrible. I tried, but I could never force myself to get more than half-way. I finally gave up."
53,1,I had heard that the book was somewhat different from the movie but the first parts were very similar. Unfortunately I didn't get past the beginning of Percy's training at the camp as Percy irritated me. Too much teenage bitterness does not endear one to a character sadly. I wanted to like this book but I couldn't.
54,1,"I didn't actually finish the book, but man did I endure it longer than I should have. I started by reading the paper book, but I was not liking it at all. Then I decided to continue my progress with the audio book, and I really disliked that. The voice that Riordan wrote with was just too immature for me, and the plot wasn't interesting enough."
55,1,"I didn't like the story at all. I don't get it.

The only thing I liked in this book was some of the humor. Practically everyone they meet turns out to be a villain (would have been enough to stop at one or two, I think) and I just didn't understand the point of the story."
56,1,Uhgg! Every time I try to read or even think about this book I shudder. Such a weak plot...such bad chapter titles...THE CHARACTERS DISCUST ME! All I can say is this book deserved a GOOSE EGG rating! O stars!
57,1,"Most over rated, poorly written young adult book i have EVER encountered!!!"
58,1,I am very disappointed with this book. I dnf it on page 100 because I couldn't take it anymore. I hope if I read it in the future I will like it more.
59,1,I only read this because my cousins are obsessed with it. I did not enjoy. I have never liked this kind of book so idk what I was expecting but I won’t be reading the rest of the series
60,1,"Ugh.

I can see how, in some ways, this is an enjoyable enough YA adventure. And in other ways unrelated to classical myth is less so (e.g., characters withhold important information from the hero for no reason at all so often it becomes a joke; the prophesy about betrayal by a friend is fulfilled in the most cop-out way possible), but I want to focus on the use of myth.

First of all, there are the things that just seem like mistakes. A big deal is made of the children of Poseidon and Athena working together, and the risk that, if the gods go to war, those two will be on opposite sides just like in the Trojan War -- except that they were both on the Greek side in the Trojan War. A minor thing, and I have no problem with an author rewriting myths; but that just seems like laziness. And of course, Athena having a daughter at all seems like a problem; Artemis' virginity is mentioned as a reason why there are no children of hers at Camp Half-Blood, but Athena's is just ignored. I know Athena is a popular mythical figure, and once you've stuck yourself with the idea of demigods, you have to find a way around some restrictions, but I would have appreciated at least a little bit of handwaving on this subject. Also, why would Poseidon have a son named Perseus? And so on.

The real problem, though, isn't this sort of nitpicking (how much does it matter, really, how ""accurate"" a book's treatment of Greek myth is?) but the way that Riordan's use of myth flattens it out and throws away a lot of promising opportunities. For example: just after we're introduced to Athena's daughter, we hear about the other gods' children at the camp, and which are the most important: ""If you're a child of Aphrodite or Demeter, you're probably not a real powerful force"" (p. 96).

Ahem. The ancient stories about Aphrodite are constantly making the point that she is the most powerful being around, that even the other gods fear her, that if you scoff at her power something very unpleasant will happen to you, etc. (This is generally about the power of love as an emotion, but Aphrodite also gets understood as a cosmic force, source of life, binding principle of the universe.) One of her canonical (so to speak) half-mortal offspring is a major hero, and through him she's the ancestor of the Romans (Rome is mentioned a couple of times in this book as the place the gods moved from Greece).

Now, I understand that you might want to keep Aphrodite out of your young adult novel, if only to get it past the censors. Fine. But with Demeter, there's no such excuse. Demeter would be perfect for this kind of story. She has canonical affairs with mortals, a canonical child, canonical major conflicts with other gods. And the idea that she's not that powerful is absolutely foreign to ancient accounts. Agriculture was the main source of food for ancient Greece (and, come to think of it, for the modern world), and Demeter is correspondingly important. She's the goddess who almost wipes out humanity when her daughter is missing, until Zeus arranges for Hades to give her back. She's the goddess who, if you cut down the wrong tree, will curse you with a hunger so great that you end up devouring yourself. She has a mystery-cult whose followers get a special status in the underworld. Why on earth would you casually dismiss her from your fantasy world? Well, two reasons: first, a lazy and superficial attitude towards myth, and second, an overriding assumption that men are more interesting than women (and boys than girls, and gods than goddesses).

I want to be clear that this assumption comes from the modern author, not the ancient source material. Given the book's willingness to change things around in Greek myth, there's no excuse for maintaining the status of the three senior male gods as the most powerful - a status which isn't as consistent as you might expect in the ancient material.* The gods we actually meet in the novel are Dionysus, Ares, Hades, Zeus, and Poseidon; no sign of any goddesses. The heroes visit Hades; Persephone is not mentioned. Annabeth, as the daughter of Athena, is occasionally the subject of comments about always having a plan; but in practice, the male hero comes up with the plans every time. The less said about Percy's mother, the better.

I really wanted to like this book. I certainly owe it for bringing a bunch of students to my Classical Myth courses, and they all seem to have enjoyed it. Maybe I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. But I'm not sure I wouldn't rather have no book based in Greek myth at all than one that makes the myths so dull.

Oh, and one other thing. Much is made of Percy being relatively poor, and feeling out of place among his richer classmates. His mom works at a candy shop, his stepdad manages an electronics store. But they live in an apartment on the Upper East Side, and Percy is sent to a series of prestigious private schools (the alternative is mentioned once, when he says he wanted to be at home with his mom ""even if I had to go to public school"" [p.17]). This is never explained, and it drove me crazy.


*The mythical Hera and Demeter both give Zeus serious trouble at times, and gender certainly doesn't seem to affect rank among the gods as much as seniority -- in the Iliad, Hermes knows better than to fight with Leto."
61,1,"I know, by posting this review I'll probably get a never-ending backlash from die-hard fans of this series. People who love this book and would sell their soul to Rick Riordan, no hesitation. Those who had a childhood fantasy of going to camp half blood, which they haven't quite let go of.

I had a fear of reading this book for a very long time. No, I wasn't scared that it would give me nightmares or something like that, I was scared that I wouldn't like it. Needless to say, I was right.

I knew that there was a HUGE fandom surrounding this book. Even people who I haven't seen reading a book since 4th grade, seem to have loved this book. That's the thing, I didn't read this book when I was like 8, I'm reading this book the summer going into high school.

The reason why so many people love re-reading books like these is because of nostalgia. I grew up on books like Harry Potter, Land of Stories, School for Good and Evil, a Series of Unfortunate Events, Ella Enchanted, Little House on the Prarie, etc. And the reason why I love these books so much is I get to pretend like I'm 9 again. Sure the stories are good but if I read a book series like Harry Potter now, I probably wouldn't warship it like I did as a 9-year-old. So I respect the fandom a lot but reading a book series like this after coming from books written by people like Cassandra Clair or Holly Black, the series is kinda a letdown.

Lol, I think that may have been the longest intro I've ever written. Anyway, review time :)

Where do I start with this book? The entire thing was an utter disaster.

So there are a LOT of issues with this book, but one of them that I couldn't stand was the fact that Percy never learned ANYTHING!!!
Let me explain.
In a book like HP, we learn only as much as Harry learns when he learns. We only know the spells that Harry knows. Percy Jackson just walks into this world for five seconds and all of a sudden knows everything. So you're telling me that a 12-year-old with no prior experience can all of a sudden beet gods (which have been practicing for 1,000s of years) at duels? As readers, we don't get to see him learn or grow from his mistakes. We don't even get to know how to duel.

As a reader, I had no idea what was going on. No rules for this world were set beforehand. We weren't told what the limits for this world were. We weren't told anything. It was hard to be immersed in the story when this 12-year-old brat knew everything.

Now, a friendly reminder to all authors, :)

Tbh, I didn't care about any of the characters. They were all blander than saltine crackers. No, being the chosen one isn't a personality trait.

This series had so much potential, yet I am very disappointed. Imagine if this book series was YA or even adult. It would be so much fun to read about the gods and their messed-up love lives.

Anyway, I don't plan on continuing this series."
62,1,i hate it i hate percy jackson so much this does not interest me at all and i had to listen to it daily for 2 years during school screw u mr pope
63,1,"Un-fucking-believable!

Never in my life have I been so glad for a book to end!

I mean, I realize this is supposed to be for children, but jesus kids deserve better than this!

This is lazy, poorly written, misrepresentative garbage.

I can't even begin to say how much I loathed Percy Jackson or just about everyone in this book. I mean, why is everyone in this a total asshole?

On top of that, this is so badly written. Percy's mom dies: he's over it in 2 days-and don't give me that Ambrosia bullshit because you can take it and stuff it! Don't know who Percy's dad is? Then you're dumber than you look. A punch in the stomach if you can't guess who Auntie M is. A push down the stairs if you don't know who's going to betray Percy later in the book. And it goes on like that! Percy's mom is a domestic abuse survivor, well that's just tossed in at the end for whatever reason-sickening!

I keep seeing posts on Reddit where people complain about the lousy movie that was made of this, but (even though I have no intention of further torturing myself by watching what I can only assume will be terrible) I can only figure that they must have made changes that would improve this godawful nightmare.

Also, Hades wasn't evil. The underworld and afterlife and evil didn't take on that until the Christians. Also, I don't think Hades would cheat on Persephone. But the gods in this book come off as spoiled assholes. But I think I've said that, already.

There is an episode of The Simpsons where Homer, Bart and a selected gang of Springfield residents try to pull off a ""tween-lit-gang-write"". It's not a bad episode. That's how this comes off: A semi-literate group of creative writing majors sitting around a table tossing out story ideas left and right and, just like the participation trophies of the days of old, everyone gets to contribute. Even the author name seems made up. I mean if he had some sort of strange background about being hit in the head with a crumpet then I would be totally convinced that he doesn't exist.

The one interesting character, maybe, was Luke, though the narrator (Jesse Bernstein, terrible, just terrible) gives him a stupid surfer accent--in fact, many of the accents he does are just piss-poor. But Luke, I think, would have been a far more interesting character to follow-a guy with a grudge against the gods who wants to tear it all down. That's a hero I'd follow."
64,1,"ignore this please i was like 12 😭

The Percy Jackson Series by Rick Riordan is an overrated disaster, I recently had the misfortune of reading the books and it was truly disappointing. The same old plot and dull characters were putting me to sleep. The whole way through I tried to think of some reason to continue; 5 books that I had to force myself to turn the pages to out of boredom.

It's a failed blend of magic, mystery, myth and humour. The endless action scenes and typical ‘main character having endless opportunities handed to him on a silver platter, because of unique ancestry’ got boring after the first chapter.

Needless to say, I was disappointed, recycling the well-written elements of magic from Harry Potter with history did not work. It's like the author expects us to know Greek mythology, as well as they do with no proper introduction to it nor explanation. Half god, half human and half wizard, half muggle, and the use of Half Blood?! Ring any bells; yes, so many, copy and paste, change a few words was what Rick Riordon tried to do, the iconic trio was horribly written and the humour was dry and forced. It seems that the overuse of mortal peril and near-death situations was used to disguise the lack of structure and description.

Somehow the book was adapted into a movie that many fans complained about, so much so that the 3rd movie was cancelled. It was most likely the visual of the books that made them wake up and realize that it was just rubbish. Yet some still blame it on the change of the original plot, of course it was only so bad because the book was too, but hey, ignorance is bliss, or in this case, denial.

Clearly, Percy Jackson was written on little knowledge. The complexity of the plot and basic language were an attempt to bring in a wider audience but I prefer books with originality and new ideas and a directed purpose that either interests or doesn’t. I must say, my favourite part was right at the end, in fact a week after the end when the confusing story had finally left my mind and the tasteless characters were history where they should've been left."
65,1,"One night when I had nothing better to do, I watched The Lightning Thief film on TV. It was dreadful. So horrendously dreadful. I thought the books must surely be better. After all, this is a best-selling series, beloved by millions. So I picked up the book and prepared to be amazed.

Let me say that I love children's literature. Winnie-the-Pooh and the Moomintroll series delighted me. I also love fantasy literature. LOTR and were my bread-and-butter growing up. So I was prepared to judge this book as a children's novel aimed at children.

Let me also say that I almost always finish books. once defeated me, and so did Percy Jackson. (Though for entirely different reasons.) I barely made it through Percy's arrival at Hogwarts-- I mean Camp Half-Blood-- and he was about to be Sorted into his House-- I mean cabin, when I put the book down and didn't have the stomach to pick it up again.

The characterization of Percy after his mother's ""death"" was what did it. The boy has one, living family member (that he knows of) and he watches her die. Hours later, he is crushing on a hot chick. I doubt even Don Juan would be crushing on anyone just after . But hey, we all grieve in different ways.

You want to know how a well-written adolescent boy character reacts when he sees a parental figure die before his eyes? Read Harry's reaction to
death in

Other reviewers have said this feels like a Potter knock-off. I did not read far enough to agree or disagree, but this is a juvenile book aimed at juvenile readers, in the fullest sense of the word."
66,1,"Well. Hmmm. Part of the problem is the narrator for the audiobook was NOT good. He worked way too hard to do different voices and it was very offputting. Very. But also, this was clunky. And it felt to me like a very obvious attempt to do a Harry Potter sort of thing. I wondered when this book was written and published in relation to Harry Potter book 1 and they were two years apart - Harry Potter coming before this series. There were just so many obvious attempts to ride the train of fame that Harry Potter created for writers.

Percy Jackson is a 12-year-old boy who discovers he is a half-blood, half Greek god and half-human. Upon finding out this surprising news Percy becomes a resident of Half-blood Hill and is sent on a quest to recover Zeus' lightning bolt. Taking along his new friends, Grover and Annabeth, Percy travels from one coast to another to gain access to the Underground where they think the bolt is.

It felt like Riordan was trying way too hard to be relatable and clever with Percy and the other characters. The jokes are all based on mythical creatures and gods and whomever your Greek god was the parent. It was not cheesy, it was just bad. From time to time I could see where my oldest nephew probably chuckled and thought something was clever so for 10 and 11-year-olds this series might be right on target. I felt annoyed at the capers Percy and friends got into and I didn't enjoy the journey at all. I had planned on reading the series because my oldest nephew did and liked it but I can't. I just can't read any more of this series. And I don't think it's because I'm an adult, a Harry Potter fan, or whatever - I think because it's just not very good...in my very humble opinion."
67,1,"Quite dissappointed in this one. While I would say it is not horrible, I could not get along with it and had to stop after the first third. Its only my second book ever that I haven't finished reading and the first fantasy. But its too meesy, too flat really. Even as a kid I would have not liked it.

The story is not well developed, there is way too muhc happening all the time, adn there is certainly too much want-to-be-funny! humour in every second or third sentence. There is no depth in anything, neither the descriptions of surroundings, no emotions in the feelings described and everything is put in front of the reader without real space for imagination.

I might try and get back to it another time, but I can't see the appeal in this one.

/

Ziemlich enttäuscht von diesem Buch. Ich würde nicht sagen dass es komplett Grauenhaft ist und sicherlich interessant fuer den ein oder anderen juengeren Leser/in, aber ich konnte absolut nichts mit Percy Jackson anfangen und musste nach dem ersten Drittel aufhören. Es ist erst mein zweites Buch überhaupt, das ich nicht zu Ende gelesen habe, und das erste aus der Kategorie Fantasy. Aber es ist zu kitschig, zu flach . Auch als Kind/Jugendlicher hätte ich es nicht gemocht.

Die Geschichte ist nicht gut entwickelt, es passiert die ganze Zeit viel zu viel, und es gibt sicherlich zu viel Möchtegern-Lustigen Witz der nicht passend und oft nervend ist. Und das in in jedem zweiten oder dritten Satz. Es gibt weder Tiefe oder Klarheit in den Dialogen, noch in den Beschreibungen der Umgebung, keine Emotionen in den beschriebenen Gefühlen und alles wird dem Leser ohne wirklichen Raum für Vorstellungskraft präsentiert.

Die Ursprungsidee ist sicherlich gut, die aussfuehrung Mangelhaft."

69,1,"At first before I read the book I was so into reading a book like this. Greek mythology, action and adventure, and just fiction in general, are some of the things I love in a book. I personally think this was kind of a letdown. I did not like the characters, the greek mythology was almost completely inaccurate, and the story to me was just very bland and undeveloped. There is not much to rate on this book because the feeling I normally feel when reading a new book is not there. I am frankly surprised that I surpassed the first chapter much less read the full book. I will not read any of the other books, this one is good for me."
70,1,"A complete knockoff of the Harry Potter series, complete with a misfit hero who has unexplained abilities, goofy male and intelligent female sidekicks, hateful adoptive parent, and an unsuspected nemesis living out in the open. In a reverse of the Potter series, Percy Jackson spends his summer at camp and his school year trying to stay alive. I was disappointed in the quality of the writing and the predictability of the story. However, my 4th grade students (two of them anyway) absolutely LOVE this series, so it has value for someone. Just not me."
71,1,"Feels like the author lacked imagination, so he had to write the whole story around Greek mythology, which isn't that interesting to me. My main annoyance was the childishness of this book. I suppose I could've known, but the reviewers here were unanimously positive regardless. The whole story is written from the perspective of a 12 yo American kid. You can see the plot coming a mile away, and the dumb questions will drive you nuts."
72,1,"Mr. Riordan should be paying royalties to J.K. Rowling. Poorly written with shallow, hollow characters. The Story line is a pure ripoff of the Harry Potter series. A waste of time. I quit the series part way through book two when it became obvious the author was never going to find his own imagination."
73,1,"I have tried and tried and tried with this book, but I just can't do it. I've even tried to read the graphic novel and it just doesn't do anything for me. I just don't care about the characters at all. I love mythology and I thought this would be a great read, but no. However, I couldn't stop listening to the Red Pyramid, it's absolutely fantastic."
74,1,"Edit: April 3 2016
The more I think about it, I just really didn't enjoy this book so I am lowering it to a one star


Im sorry to all the Percy Jackson fans, I really wanted to like this. But I couldn't. I would have enjoyed this when I was younger. But I liked the greek mythology aspect which gave it an extra star."
75,1,"I think it is a bit overrated. I appreciate the creativity, but the author could not seem to transform this into a well-written book. It is a mediocre book compared to its popularity. I read half-way through and gave up on it. I guess some people like it, but I just didn't see what is so great about it."
76,1,I don't do this often but omfg this book is so epically craptastic I just had to let it out. It reads like it was written by a 9 year old who was kept back a few grades. The plot is absolutely bogus. Characters are just a shambles of idiocity and such utter nonsense I can't even BEGIN to describe how bad. So bad. So very bad. I wasted 2hrs of my life on this book. Don't fall into the same trap.
77,1,"This book took me WAY to long to finish... And I actually finished it a while ago but... I forgot it was on my reading list, XD. I don't really understand the big thing about Percy Jackson, it was a pretty average book. Maybe I disliked it because I knew what was going to happen (my brother told me before I started reading it.). I don't know, but I did not like it. The end."
78,1,"Maybe if I was still a 4th grader I would like this book, but currently, I just find the language annoying. It’s just so…. Well childish. Obviously since the main character is like 12, but I just cannot get through it. I will not repeat the same mistake I did with the wheel of time, so I’ll just leave this."
79,1,I was so disappointed in this book!! I expected an easy fun quick read but instead found the most poorly written book I've read in a very long time. It is an insipid version of Harry Potter. And then I saw the movie (on a plane) and that was equally as lame as the book.
80,1,"After falling in love with Harry Potter, I couldn't stand these books. My 6-year-old son LOVES them though. They are simplistic, the monsters are larger than life, and the main character always saves the day. Great for kids. Not so great for adults."
81,1,"Even with the joy of following along with my son, I just couldn't finish this one. Perhaps it is simply aimed at too young an audience, but I just wasn't enjoying the process of reading it unlike other books such as Hunger Games or the Harry Potter series."
82,1,"This book was dreadful. Fair enough if you read it when your 11 or below but if your going to read it above that age, I wouldn't bother. It was extremely childish and I was disappointed after all the hype about these books. I definitely won't be reading anymore in the series."
83,1,"I couldn't get into this story. I know people like it and I'm a lover of Greek mythology but this book did not do a good job at making it interesting. I see how grade schoolers could like it, but it was not for me."
84,1,"well. i didn't enjoy it. probably i pick it after finishing Harry potter. maybe not. the character's are not that realistic. even plot are boring. so i didn't enjoy it.
nothing is like harry potter after all"
85,1,"Okay. People will hate me for this but I don’t care. This series is trash and Percy is like Harry Potter in one of his angry moments. The only part I liked was Vegas, hence the one star. I don’t recommend it"

87,1,i give it a five because is a good book is about gods so we can know what was going on

91,1,"Boo! Fake Harry Potter, and not a very good imitation at that."
92,1,I cant see the point of reading this instead of Illiad or Odyssee. It is less imaginative and as formulaic.
93,1,"Written well, just not my genre. I read it for my kids."

107,1,"DNF (for now?), I probably should've read this when I was younger."
108,1,
109,1,"Re-read, in Spanish.

The first time I read Percy I did not like it very much. I thought the story(and I hate when people does this, but I couldn´t help it) was very similar to Harry Potter. I only read it because this book kept showing up in all forums regarding ""after HP... what?"".

Now, in my mid-tweenties, I thought I should give Percy Jackson a 2nd chance. Why not? The book was on sale.

Unfortunately, I stick to my first opinion. First of all, I could not like Percy. I thought he was very cocky, being only 12-years-old. I know heroes are supposed to be brave, defiant, etc, but in his case, I thought he was arrogant and sassy (hello, Ares is not enemy, he is a God, for God´s sake). And sending Medusa´s head to the Olympic was too much. The Olympic! Where all the Gods live! Where his father is! Just because he was ""angry""... Or when he saw Grover making ""something"" like the sign of the cross, only more ancient... how would he know? Or things that were a mystery, he had a that it was this or that... how would he know? And when he saw Luke´s sword, who could injure mortal or immortals, Percy remembered that ""a hero was never supposed to harm mortals unless it were absolutely necessary"". But when he, Grover and Annabeth had that encounter with that group of bad guys, he did not hesitate to take his own sword out to try to harm them.

Second of all, I did not feel too much chemistry between the 3 friends. Like they were not friends; more like companions in a mission. And it was too much that the only thing that made Grover so ""funny"" was that he was always thinking about food.

Thirtly, the similarity with HP & the Philosopher Stone:

- Grover=Ron; Annabeth=Hermione; Nancy Bobofit=Dudley; Dionysus=Snape; Chiron=Dumbledore; Clarisse=Malfoy.
- After Harry found out he was a wizard, he remembered several episodes in his earlier life involving strange things; the same happened to Percy, only less believable: he defeating a snake (hellooo, we know that happened to Hercules, why the hell did it happen to Percy too? He was not super-strong); he remembering his father (who disappeared when he was what? months-old? How could he remember his father?)
- When he fights the Minotaur, it is pretty much the same when Harry fought the troll.
- When Dionysus says something like ""our new celebrity""... ring a bell, anyone? Snape in his first lesson to Harry.
- Houses in the camp: houses in Hogwarts.
- Food appear magically at lunch
- The revelation of the enemy in the story: Luke, who was a nice guy (Quirrel, who was a nice teacher), tried to kill him because he was being control by Chronos (Quirrel was controlled by Voldemort). Percy tried to stop him, losing consciousness (Harry lost consciousness when he did the same). Percy woke up, finding Chiron next to him, who advised him (Harry wakes up finding Dumbledore next to him, who tells him most of the story). It is the end of terms, and Percy says he is going to come back, because it is like his home... or something like that (Harry tells his friends Hogwarts is his home).

I think is sad, because the idea was great. I am myself a huge fan of Greek/Roman mythology. But the writing was not good (and the translation in Spanish is even worse). In fact, several ""funny"" moments did not even made me smile. I remembered this book the other day when I was watching a movie. You you are supposed to laugh at certain moments but you , cause the joke is too obvious. That is what happened to me with this book."
110,1,"Where to start?

There was potential regarding the usage of Greek mythology...but sadly the writing ruined it.

There were numerous times when I wanted to stop reading the book, but decided to carry on, due to the Ancient Greek concepts within the book.

Yes I am going to agree with others saying that this was a Harry Potter rip-off, bearing in mind there have been other books I've read that I've not considered Harry Potter rip-offs, when others have.

1) The black hair and the green eyes.
2) Two friends, a male who is clumsy/not that intelligent/obsessed with food, often makes mistakes.
3) The female friend who is intelligent/more mature than the two boys.
4) The term half blood-possibly a direct rip-off?

We then have the entire universe hiding information from Percy, every time he asks, the person doesn't explain, or doesn't have the time-this happens numerous times, and is almost always something like

""It depends on the Great-""
""What-""
""I can't tell you now-""
""But""

There is so much of the above going on, that the mystery evaporates on the spot.
I know there is something like show but don't tell, but this is 99% don't even show, and forget about telling.

We also have Percy with anger issues, so much so that the puny 12 year old gets angry at a God and is willing to take him on-I mean seriously? The most pathetic things seem to annoy Percy.

The characters are all two dimensional-well what do you expect with Percy dividing his time with getting angry at everything and everybody and feeling sorry for one of his friends, and well er doing stuff maybe??

I wouldn't say that the book is well written either, yes there are aspects of Greek mythology, but they're ruined by Americanisms-well that's what I think anyway,
I mean Camp half-blood shirts-or whatever it's called?
Some gods dressed as surfer dudes, others as killer motorcycle men

Look before people lose their heads over the above statements, I've no issues with American writers or culture, but sorry to me modern American-or any western culture, and Ancient Greek mythology don't mix-yes it's the perfect mixture for everybody else-but it's not for me, and it ruins the book.
There is even a part where it says something like 'translated into American', I mean seriously?
American?
Last time I checked they spoke English in America, not American!

As for Percy's mother ending up with that Gabe-YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!
How could any woman-despite her reasons waste her time with a pig like that?
Yes it's explained why, but it's still disgusting and revolting.
You might as well have a supermodel dating a guy who showers once every 2 years, and is riddled with every single infectious disease, and who sleeps and lives in his own waste, and then shares the bed with her-disgusting beyond belief!

I'm now wondering if book two would be any better."
111,1,"Note: You've seen the low rating. This review isn't going to be nice. If your inner child who enjoyed these books will be offended, I'd rather you skip this review entirely.

I sincerely hope that all the adults who recommended I read this haven't actually picked up this book in the last five years, because it's got some serious problems.

I don't know why I even bothered to pick this series up again - that's a lie; it's for my future class reading list- the book is still bloody awful compared to most modern fantasy. I literally lost interest halfway, because Riordan just keeps throwing things at the wall in hopes they will stick without adding anything of value to the overarching story.

It would have helped if Riordan had gone with anything but the absolute flattest interpretation of the Greek gods and their roles and personalities. When he ventured into orphic territory by mentioning the death of pan, I had hopes for a minute but those were dashed by all the rest. (Aphrodite and Dionysus were both done incredibly dirty.)

Honestly, those were the least of my worries.

Here's the elements that got me legitimately angry:

1. The constant rhetoric about the greatness and importance of western civilization, completely erasing non-western cultures in the process.

2. The constant fatphobia and connection between heavier body types and villainy. (Nancy, Clarissa, Echidna, Gabe, Ares, should I go on?)

3. A narrative about pagan gods being completely overruled by the christian notion of death equals evil. So many conversations about alternative views on the transient nature of life and death could have been had. (You know, conversations that are a real focal point in pagan belief systems, old and new.)

4. WW2 being reduced to a fantasy trope by painting it as nothing more than a spat between helfbloods + implying that Hitler was a child of Hades. WW2 and the holocaust were deeply traumatic events that deserve a more serious approach than ""the gods don't get along so they ask their children to fight"". It pretty harmful to reduce one of humanity's darkest moments to fight between nameless fantastical figures.

5. The inherent misogyny of praising a woman for letting herself be abused to ""protect her child"".

6. Painting Medusa as Poseidon's ""girlfriend"" is sexist as hell and greatly takes away from either the horror or the empowerment of the original myth (depending on which version you go with).

That's it. If you still want to read this afterwards, I won't stop you, but at least dare to take off those rose-coloured nostalgia glasses."
112,1,"Quite an old book that I read because I was looking for a ya novel that was written in first pov and past tense. most of them now were written in present tense and I had to get back eight years to find one reference that fitted.

POV and tense choice aside, the idea was good, but the main character kept getting on my nerve. The more I read, the more I couldn't stand him.

I mean... what was this kid problem?

He was dyslexia, ADHD, and bla-bla-bla -- okay, he was troubled kid -- but there were much more kids who were born with worse condition and most of them didn't get kick out from school six times in six years and then bitched around blaming it in their condition. no, they didn't let the condition took control over their life -- they overcame it.

And when Annabeth said to him:


Yeah, I agreed with her, Percy wasn't smart and it got nothing to do with his grade at school.

First of all, the moment he realized that gods existed in his universe, he should've learned to watch his attitude towards them -- especially when the said-gods weren't the most magnanimous and forgiving lots.

But this kid, even after he got into the half-blood camp, he insisted that he didn't believe in gods. okay, it was his decision entirely, but the proof had been there.

so I was like, ""okay, you didn't believe, but weren't you seeing?""

one of the gods even played game in front of him! did he wait for them to dance naked around him to see that they were real ?

Second, this twelve y.o. kid lived like he had nothing to lose.

the gods were real, they were powerful, and normal people would work the logic not to go around badmouthing them, let alone calling them 'jerk' right on their face.

but Percy, no, he had to always show attitude towards them like he didn't even care of the consequence that might come -- or maybe he just didn't really think.

If I were Zeus, I would strike him with my lightning to teach this disrespectful twelve y.o. kid some manner. if the gods were as proud as they were written in the myth, Percy should've been dead the moment he opened his mouth.



He wasn't impertinent -- he was downright stupid. (excuse my word)

Overall, the Greek mythology mix in the story was good, and for that alone, this book was a two stars for me, but I really really really didn't like Percy, so 1.5 star IMHO."
113,1,"I can honestly say that this was one of the worst books I have ever read. However, I like to start off my reviews on a rather more positive note, so before I start slagging this book off, I will praise the author for the (albeit few) aspects that I liked:

1) The first chapter was gripping and I felt compelled to read more. It was very mysterious, and set my hopes a little higher for the book.

2) Disabilities were portrayed in a positive light, and this is something that I have rarely seen done before in literature.

3) The idea of Greek mythology is great, and I would like to learn more about it.

Sorry, but that's it. I was just repelled by the utterly abysmal writing. I am 17 years old, so I can safely say that this book is intended for a younger audience than myself, however, there are children's books out there which are an enjoyable read for an adult/older teenager. This was not one of them.

The writing completely lacked any sort of description or beauty. It was far too simplistic and I just felt that everything was dumbed down and made to feel like a spoof: a painfully unfunny spoof. The jokes were awful and juvenile. I couldn't take any of the characters seriously, largely because the book was incredibly awkward in that it didn't know whether it was a comedy or a serious fantasy novel. I just felt that Greek mythology, which is beautiful and elegant in so many ways, had been destroyed in this novel. I did not fear any of the characters, nor did I admire any of them.

Don't even get me started on how this book is a complete rip-off of the Harry Potter series by J.K Rowling! I know, lots of people are saying this but it's true. The characters, such as Percy, Annabeth and Grover are practically carbon copies of Harry, Hermione and Ron, except not nearly as well-developed or deep. Certain aspects of the plot were parallel to those of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. For example, a behemoth multiple-headed dog is guarding something and the children need to distract it to get past. The main character wakes up at the end of the novel in a bed, with Chiron (or Dumbledore) watching over them. Need I say any more?

My advice would be: just don't bother with this one. You'd be better off (re)reading Harry Potter, as it's better written and infinitely more enjoyable to read."
114,1,I just didn't like it at all...a waste of my time...the idea was good though just the execution that didn't go all that great...and don't even start about the cover...
115,1,"Изумително е в какви измерения се преражда лудостта на тинейджърите, но общо взето тя винаги витае около едно – фантастиката. Първо бяха вампирите на Майър, сега полубогове. Най-хубавото в тая книга е, че ще научи всеки на малко митология.

Има неща, които нищо не може да спре, едно от тях е фантазията. В тази книга всичко е изградено върху нея, не знам защо, но ми напомня за „Дракула”, нещо истинско обвито във фантазия. Цяла митология от богове натъпкани тук и обвързани от нещо. Лично аз съм фен на Хадес, въпреки всички лоши неща по негов адрес.

Първо гледах филма, който излезе наскоро, а чак сега чета книгата. Има общо, не мога да отрека, има много общи неща, но както винаги и много неща се разминават. Чудното обаче е, че ми е трудно да кажа кое е по-добро, филмът или книгата. Филмите винаги са по-емоционални, а книгите по-реални и тук е така.

Не успя да ме изуми или да ме вкара във възторг, може би заради начина, по който бях настроена към нея. Има толкова неща, в които се опитват да ни накарат да повярваме, само защото сме хора. И сякаш никога не е достатъчно, не е достатъчно да сме вампири и да сеем смърт, по-късно трябва да сме Богове, за да поправяме света, а преди това трябваше да сме магьосници и винаги да ни гони злото, но поне в последното има истина. Винаги ни гони злото, независимо дали в един човешки живот или някакъв по-висш.

За разбирането, че това е следващата тинейджърска страст съм съгласна, главният герой е на 13. Но мен просто не успя да ме трогне, за това не вземайте мнението ми насериозно, аз не бях трогната и от лудницата „Здрач”, но има нещо, което винаги ще признавам като най-добрата тинейджърска фантастика, както и милиони хора с мен по света и това е „Хари Потър”. Класиката е завинаги и за съжаление тя не може да бъде заменена от Посейдон, Зевс или пък Хадес.

Книгата е увлекателна все пак, чете се бързо и много ми хареса формата под който е. Самите й размери. Не е в нормалните размери и на мен ми беше много удобна за четене, най-вече в час по английски. Ще видим как ще бъде с останалите книги от поредицата."
116,1,"I love children's literature! Sometimes I'm at my happiest when I'm reading a children's book. But Percy Jackson represents most of the things that children's literature does wrong such as the constant employment of over-simplified, colloquial language (ex. ""My shield was the size of a professional basketball backboard. It must have weighed a million pounds!""). I understand that children don't have the vocabulary that teenagers or adults have but books can still have the musical rhythm and occasional difficult word that blends prose and poetry. Read Kathryn Lasky's ""Wolves of the Beyond"" series and you'll notice the astounding elevation in literary quality even thought it is a popular work of fiction!
Rick Riordan's first Percy Jackson novel is a novel that pretends to be creative by using ancient Greek mythology to appeal to a wider audience. There is nothing original going on here because the process for Riordan was clearly formulaic: Use Greek mythology in the context of a pre-teen, half-God. He doesn't bend or twist the rules. Every single event which occurs in Greek myth is taken literally in Percy's universe. The prose is dry but the lesser of three evils when you consider internal and social dialogue. Riordan's inability to incorporate any level of emotion in a failed attempt at tragedy is laughable. Quite frankly, this novel is a poor-excuse for one that fails on almost every level. I would recommend this book to younger children just to pique their interest in Greek mythology in a way that's more relatable.

To end on a brighter note, here's some of my favourite children's lit books: Silverwing, Firewing (Kenneth Oppel); Charlotte's Web (White); The Once and Future King (T.H. White); Guardians of Ga'hoole series and Wolves of the Beyond series (Kathryn Lasky); Goosebumps (R.L. Stine)."
117,1,"I am not the demographic for this book. I am not a young boy between roughly 9 and 13. I know this and tried to keep that in mind as I read, and yet I still had a hard time stomaching the ridiculousness of the plot and dialogue. It was juvenile to a fault. I mean defeating the
giant hellhound of Hades, Cerberus, with a friendly game of fetch because his master doesn't give him enough playtime is not my idea for a good fantasy story.


What I also didn't much care for was the internal narrative of our protagonist, Percy Jackson. I completely concede my distaste is derived from being 20+ years removed from teenage angst. Still, Percy's thoughts were annoying and I was counting down the pages till I could check this off my list.


Which brings me to probably my biggest compliant: this came from my list. Kids are having trouble readying or something? Have we now lowered our standards so much as to ""require"" kids to read this dribble?! If the list is accurate, I am both disappointed in our education system and saddened for our kids. Woah...perhaps Percy's melodrama is rubbing off on me.


did get me to think about ONE thing. Much to my surprise, the Harry Potter series has had a fair amount of criticism and negative reviews. Even knowing that, I've been taken aback by actually talking with people who were with the books. My own wife (if I had only known) couldn't even finish because it couldn't hold her interest. And she's a middle school teacher! Perhaps I can understand that concept a bit more now. I mean, Harry Potter critics are still crazy....but I have to admit that I can appreciate their viewpoint more today than I did I yesterday. Thank you for that, Mr. Riordan."
118,1,"I can't keep reading this. I realized I was reading a chapter here and there just to finish it rather than because I enjoyed it. I can see myself loving this at a much younger age but, alas, the years have changed me much.
My biggest problem with it is the overuse of the same methods to drive the plot. For example, check out the following scene between Percy and Grover.










My problem with this scene is that it happens SO MUCH. A character sharing, and then realizing that they've shared too much, and then deciding to stop sharing, and then we're left to think ""uh huh! something is going on here"" is an incredibly overused plot driver in this book.

Also, I'm a big fan of books that do a good job of tricking me and making me believe one way. I actually think I'm a pretty good audience for these types of books and movies (a la Fight Club, Beautiful Mind, etc. I'm the last person to FIGURE IT OUT). However, this book had too many doh moments that I figured out way before Percy did. ""Oh I get it, this is Medusa because of snakes and frozen statues and...oh wow doh how clever.""

I read this to connect better with my students but, 200 pages in, I really can't get myself to finish it :/"
119,1,"i only read half of the book! now hear me out. i should have maybe of given this book abit more of a chance but i dont know what it was i just really didnt enjoy the book. it maybe the way i was reading the book but to me what was going on i just didnt quite understand what on earth was happening most the time.

the way things were explained i just really didnt enjoy the book at all. and i know this is a very popular series but i tried reading this book rwice and i just had to put it down in the end i just sold the books.

i really hope that this doesnt put you off trying to read this series just becasue i didnt enjoy it. however i did actully enjoy the films now im not one to the ever watch the films before the series but this time i did and i glad i did beacsue i may not of ever have watched the films at all."
120,1,they lied to me
121,1,"I guess I'm in the minority, because this just wasn't for me. I'd give it 1 star, but.. eh. This isn't meant to spark any hate for all the people who love this book and series, it's just my opinion.

I had an extremely hard time getting through this book. I didn't enjoy it at all. I listened to it in something like 10 sittings and stopped at about 90% when I couldn't take it anymore and wasn't able to finish it.

Because of all the hype that this book series gets, I was expecting it to be a book that can be read at any age. Like Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, or a newer release - The Glass Sentence. Or any one of the many Middle Grade books that are amazing and fascinating at 8, 12, 18, 25, 50, 60 etc. (Not all are, of course, but there are a ton!)

For me, this was just not the case.
Not only did it read like it's suited only for young readers, but I thought it was just too cheesy. I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1, because I'm sure that many people like it with all the cheesiness and if I was 12 when I read it, I might have given it 3 stars. So I'll compromise.

The imagination of the author is.. well, very imaginative. So many things happen and there are a lot of details and I guess it was written well. Though I wasn't even able to pay attention to the writing style, because of all the cheesy dialogue and the weird things happening. Great for a younger reader, but not something that appealed to me now. Maybe if I had read it as a child and this was a reread, maybe I'd think differently. I don't know.. But somehow I don't think I'd have enjoyed it as a child either."
122,1,"This book series is a constant point of contention for me.

when I was in 1st grade as part of an ""advanced reading"" class I was instructed to read this book. I didn't. in my first reading of the book I probably got about 10 pages in before throwing up my hands and saying, ""I hate this!""

In third grade when all my friends were reading the series I tried again. this time I forced myself to finish the book before throwing up my hands and saying, ""I hate this!""

In 6th grade, part of the series was required reading for a grade. I was so determined to hate it and was completely shocked that I didn't. the book that we were reading was void of any plot really but was more about the backstory of the gods and goddesses which I found very interesting. so because of this, I gave this book another chance. but no. I still threw my hands up and exclaimed, ""I hate it!""

Then a week ago I saw the dreaded book on my bookshelf and thought what the heck. so I sat down finished it and threw it away. this book had no real original plot. it was one cliche following another. the narrator's voice wasn't unique at all and the integration of the Greek gods just seemed cheap. the idea of making the gods more in today's society and ""funny"" wasn't nessasarly a bad one. the way it was executed however wasn't good. Personally, I believe that this book should only be read by elementary leave readers who have been exposed to the main cliches of fantasy novels. the word-choice is able to be read by elementary students and frankly, that's where this book should stay. in the depths of some in-class school library to be read by children then forgotten about."
123,1,I STRONGLY disliked this book. The writing was poop and it felt sexist.
124,1,"Может, популярность этой книги не сбавляет обороты и поныне потому, что люди познакомились с ней в соответствующем возрасте, и теперь их интерес держится на ностальгии? Понимаю, каждому своё, но мне невдомёк почему «Перси Джексон» все ещё так обожаем, и любые новости по нему (привет предстоящему сериалу от Disney+) вызывают БУМ в сети. Наверное, я действительно недооцениваю греческую мифологию и её влияние на культуру потребления.

В рецензиях обычно отмечают хороший юмор и неплохое раскрытие уже упомянутой мифологииЯ ни того ни другого здесь для себя не увидела

Персонажи посредственные. Взять в сравнение «Гарри Поттера»: первая книга в серии также максимально детская, но написана она интересно, увлекает, хотя и представляет все тех же Избранного, Заучку и Неудачника; Роулинг делает это с изюминкой, поэтому и любопытно. «Перси Джексон» ощущается как дешёвая замена книгам Роулинг со всей этой клоунадой с Богами.

О, и у книги ужасная экранизация. Признаю, на фоне фильма писанина Риордана выигрышнее. Автор книг хоть обладает умом, дабы пояснить за любой логический вопрос, который может возникнуть у читателя, а вот фильм не только не хочет объяснять , но и более того – меняет некоторые сюжетные линии, делая историю ещё глупее. Прям детский садик ясельная группа с 0% логики, и пачкой пафоса от подростков а-ля"
125,1,"I fail to see why this series is so popular with kids; I found it boring and filling with stereotypical characters. The main plot line is that Percy Jackson, a sixth grader with ADHD and dyslexia, discovers that he is the son of Poseidon and a human mother. He undertakes a quest with his friends, Grover, a satyr and Annabeth, the half human daughter of Athena to return Zeus's lightning bolt.

There are similarities to the Harry Potter series--discovering magical talents, a school (here a summer camp for ""half bloods""), adventures with a male and female friend, an unhappy home life in the real world. However these elements are not handled as well as in Rowling's fictional world. Percy is never a very likeable character and the abusive stepdad is a garish cliche.

Much of the plot and action is based around the actions of the gods and Percy fights demons from mythology on his quest. Many middle grade readers love mythology so this is probably a big appeal factor. I found the action to be dull and many of the explanations for why things were happening defaulted to it is this way because these gods have always hated each other.

I listened to this book on audio and found the reader to be very sub-par. He handled the younger charcters adequately but the voices that he created for the powerful gods were robotic and without nuance. This probably added to my negative impression of the book."
126,1,
127,1,"To all reluctant readers: you're absolutely right; don't pick it up.

One star for borderline horrible. The idea of the story was good and it had lots of potential, but that was an opportunity wasted. I was intrigued by it after seeing how much hype it generated. However, when I read it, I was sorely disappointed.
The writing style was very bad, riddled with unfunny jokes. The humor was very primitive; it was the kind of humor only children would laugh at. Interactions between characters aren't realistic, with Percy's (the main character) rivals one-dimensional.
Did I mention Percy is one of the biggest Gary Stues I've ever read about? He's overpowered, popular, and constantly admired.
I was genuinely mystified as to why it was so popular, but I came to the conclusion that not many other books of this type exist, and the ones that do aren't as ""humorous"" to readers as this.
A rip-off of Harry Potter, with so many plot parallels I could write a list.
I read it when I was nine, and taking a look at it now, I have absolutely no idea how I could tolerate reading it. The book is praised for not being shallow, graphic and sexual like YA books; but I can assure you that most YA books are better-written than this, and a lot of them don't contain mature content. I recommend that you don't waste your time on Percy Jackson and the Olympians if you're over ten-years-old.

~Joumana"
128,1,"Totally disliked it. To me one of the worst books I've ever read. Probably a poor Harry Potter's copy although it's worse than the amazing serie (HP).
I thought the book had a bad-writing: the scenes were not detailed and the action happened so fast that you couldn't enjoy it. BAD!

It's impossible not to compare this book to Harry Potter, there are so many things that are the same! I won't tell what things are because everybook has already told them.

The main character was ok, his friend animal was fine too and the girl was nothing. I hate when authors make one main character do everything he want and the secondary characters seem to be nothing! They can't do amazing things like the main one, to me it's ridiculous, totally! There's no reason for such a thing! Percy Jackson can walk upon water, fly, got a nice pen-sword and his father is the greatest father a child could have! ¬¬º While the others characters are stupid and weak.

The last thing: I hated it. I payed a LOT of money on it and I wish I could go back in time to undo what I did. ""/

I know we are not talking about the movie but there's no way to say about it. I thought it was, amazingly, worse than the book. In the movie his animal friend is dirty, love chicks and only want to know about girls! Come on! It's a kids' movie, not a porn!

I really hated and I would give it -10 if I could."
129,1,"A Huge Step Forward in super-ugly neorealism.

I really wanted to like Percy Jackson. The premise of a half-god living today seemed like it had some promise. The idea may have smelled slightly of Harry Potter, but nonetheless it was hard to discount it completely, especially when I found the entire series for $20.

However, where the book's premise held some promise (and to some extent delivered), it instead proved to be the perfect example of what it looks like when adult authors try to be cool for teenage literature. Comparisons to Harry Potter aside, Rowling's novels work because (while somewhat goofy) the books remain magical without crossing the line to ridiculous. Riordan shows none of this writing ability and is instead left with a mess of gods riding motorcycles and wearing Italian suits, if for no other reason than to make it appear ""cool"". Percy Jackson is not just a half god, but one with a 'cool' attitude. Likewise, Riordan is an author who attempts to be cool by inserting extreme sports and ridiculous circumstances. In the end, the novel ends with a few interesting strands tied together by dumbed down situations and characters who become nothing more than parities of what it means to be extreme.

Shame on you Rick Riordan - you have done a disservice to literature and have simultaneously insulted the intelligence of the reader."
130,1,"The main storyline reads just like the ancient Greek stories do. So you know what to expect: affiars, violence etc.


Summary:
Percy Jackson, the hero of the story, adores his supposedly-wonderful mother. She has had an affair with Percy's father (who is a greek god). She still loves him but purposefully marries a ""slob"", using him as a cover for her son (children of greek gods are always in danger). Percy rationalizes why it is wrong for him to kill this bum, but leaves the means to do so in his dear mother's hands. She does the dirty deed herself. This is presented in the story as clever and funny. Our hero still adores his mother.

Review:
Even if you look past the causal mentioning of abuse (from the ""slob"" step father and other Greek god parents), the affairs and the like you still have to deal with violence (which is actually fairly graphic at times for a juvenile book) you still have inconsistencies in the storyline. And inconsistences in plot and story drive me crazy to no end because in a secular world we cannot expect authors there always to be positive concept in books but we should be expecting the author to come up with a story that is consistent.

As if that wasn't enough problems for one book, there are also holes in the story not to mention that I found all the characters to be very un-original and boring."
131,1,"Reading the lightning thief -- book one of the Percy Jackson pentalogy -- was like looking over my math test, that is, it's brimming with flaws each step of the way. To start, Percy Jackson, our twelve year old narrator that is suffering from ADHD, dyslexia, and a missing father, is just another cliche kid that gets powers and saves the world. The unoriginality of the story is simply appalling since there's already collections of movies and books, such as Harry Potter, that's structured around a wimpy kid getting powers and saving the world. Then there was the disastrous storyline. As someone that has held a deep fascination about worldly religions and beliefs, I beseeched that if nothing else, the plot would be entertaining; it wasn’t. Battling monster after monster after monster, I often wonder if this book is actually progressing in its storyline or if Riordan is simply lengthening the story for the sole purpose of pointlessly introducing gods and monsters. Whats worse is how Percy Jackson, this twelve year old kid from middle school who just recently found out about his powers, seemly dominates the very gods from which his power originated. However I need to thank the book because now I’m finally able to comprehend what my father means when he says,” I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed”."
132,1,"I hated this book. Hated. The story was fast-paced but lacked any ounce of sincerity. Yes, I will compare this to Harry Potter because they are written for the same age group. Where HP brought depth Percy felt completely flat in all regards. I felt no sincere tension, didn't worry for the main character or side characters one moment. The only ""depth"" is in the relationship between Percy and his mom but the way that worked out, the explanation took any true pain or feelings away. I am a history buff, I love history but the references in this book are warped to fit the story telling style so any pleasure at all was taken away for me. It's all run of the mill adventure, maybe an 8 year old boy would truly enjoy this but I'm rather sure that even if I was that age it still would have felt flat, inflated to the point of deflation. That's the struggle with American story telling and even Coca Cola isn't as American as this book is. It's formulaic, predictable and leans on cultural standards that have never appealed to me. In the time it took me to read this piece of burning garbage I'd preferred to watch something really bad like Jersey Shore. Yes, I said it, that show pleased me more then this book did. Even the spin-offs of that show pleased me more then this book did. Rick Riordan, never again."
133,1,"not a fan of this author‼️ 3 stars‼️

the writing was meh. like I get it percy and the gang are twelve years old but it was just TOO boring reading abt his thoughts. the word ugly came up too many times and by the eight hundredth and sixty seventh time I saw the word, I had a mental breakdown and could not keep going. wish I read this ten years ago because eighteen year old me did not have a slay time.

it was weird reading it cause I have seen the movie and it was way better. I love logan lerman<3 but i must admit it was interesting to see how the story was actually written and to see the what had changed in the movie compared to the book. you see much more depth and personality in the characters in here and I feel like after reading this, the movie was definitely rushed so I can’t wait for the series!!
percy definitely handled everything well considering everything he goes through. it’s for sure traumatic but he kinda just thrived through it. slay??? okay anabeth and percy they way the blush over literally anything the other one does I’m cryinggg.

anyways, I guess it was good. adventurous and such an interesting storyline. anabeth and grover are the only characters I like. percy I’ll consider you when you stop using the word ugly, jerk and punk in every sentence. it’s too cringe I can’t cope with it. everyone else is literally so annoying like pls stop."

135,1,"There is young adult fiction that tweens and elementary students enjoy and then there is young adult fiction that anyone can enjoy. This is not the second type.

It's impossible not to compare this book to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, since Harry Potter was the last YA fiction series to take the literary world by storm. And, unfortunately, there's no comparison.

Whereas J.K. Rowling created a magnificent, multi-dimensional universe, delightful characters, and intriguing plots...Riordan did not. The book is plot-driven (rather than character-driven) and reads like a cheesy screenplay; and so you finish the book not liking or caring about Percy Jackson--who is unidimensional, unemotional, and kind of stupid.


About the only credit I give Riordan is that he'll maybe get kids interested in Greek mythology and that he sold his story to Hollywood, so he's rich."
136,1,"I don't normally rate books based on my opinion of the author. But THIS?

""Personally, I don’t see any harm in learning mythology as long as we recognize the myths as stories that are part of our heritage and long-since stopped being any kind of serious religion.""

""I didn’t realize some people still worship the old Viking gods. Very strange, and a little scary... In my opinion, the more you learn about the mythology, the more impossible it is to take it seriously as a religion... after you’ve met Odin and Thor in the stories, who in their right mind would ever want to worship them?""

Listen, I'm a pagan and I honestly don't care what people think about my religion. I get all kinds of shit for it. Christians call me a devil worshiper, atheists call me delusional... I've heard it all, really.

But never, NEVER have I seen someone with the fucking audacity to throw two entire religions (Asatru and Hellenismos--Google it) under the bus WHILE FINANCIALLY BENEFITING FROM THOSE RELIGIONS. If you're writing a wildly popular series about the Norse, Roman, Egyptian, and Greek gods, I expect you to at least respect those gods who are effectively earning you millions of dollars.

So way to go Rick, you've set a new standard for douchebaggery. *slowclap*"
137,1,"""Pubescence At Its Most Juvenile""

There are books written for the young'uns that are written so well that anyone can enjoy them, all across the age board (Harry Potter). The Percy Jackson series isn't one of them. Reaching the last page, I cried baby-like (with kickings and blubberings) at the loss of those couple of hours I'll never be able to get back...

Written with a character in mind who seems to be from the less intelligent side of the 12-year-old demographic, I felt that the psychological and social complexities of being a kid at that age were dumbed down for, I don't know, 12-year-old rutabagas?

My personal opinion is that stories are compelling because the people they are about are interesting and have a unique story to tell. It's why the people we read about will usually start out as peasants from the Middle-of-Nowhere and go on to become the long-lost prophesied progeny of an All-Magnificent God of Magnificence. Or something therelike. wasn't horrible, it just wasn't very intelligent, funny, or original. Unless you're twelve? *shrugs*"
138,1,"A fun, little adventure story BUT JESUS CHRIST. The AUDACITY to call Medusa Poseidon's girlfriend? Sweets, he raped her. Also, Mr Brunner or whatever his pseudonym was (Chiron) is a Latin teacher but the exam is full of questions concerning mythology? And just teaches about mythology? Sure, sometimes in Latin class we read texts that deal with mythology but.. that's... whatever. ALSO, Athena, the VIRGIN goddess of war, has children? Excuse me? So Artemis doesn't have children because she's one of the THREE virgin goddesses (Athena, Artemis and Hestia), but Athena has MULTIPLE children? Did she forget her vows or something? No, sorry, NEXT. And why do they (the satyrs and gods and whoever else) use both Ancient Greek and Latin? Is this story about Greek gods or not? Also, what the fuck was that weird casino/hotel thing about? Still confused about that. The story itself is fine and I know that this is not a retelling of myths but really? SOME accuracy, please. And I'm not even going to get into the fact that the gods apparently use cameras and TVs and whatnot and that Mount Olympus is accessed by an elevator..."
139,1,"Ok, the fact that it took me over a month and a half to read this book should tell you something about how little I cared about it or the characters or the plot. It was a poor attempt to imitate ""Harry Potter"" from characters to plot to situations. The plot jumped around from adventure to adventure too quickly. The story and character development was weak and uninteresting. The monsters appeared throughout the story like they did in ""Men in Black"" - disguised humans with ulterior motives, mainly intent on killing Percy. The greek mythology was confusing, with some explanations for some of the prominent gods and no explanations for others. I thought it was cute the way he described his dyslexia as being as result of having ancient Greek as his primary language, however I think his ADD excuses were contrived to try to make things sensible. He easily solved problems that he didn't even know were problems 5 minutes before. I was disappointed after all the hype and won't be reading the rest of the books as I heard they basically follow the same formula of book one."
140,1,"I did not enjoy this journey into 'The Heart of Western Civilisation'. (OMG the ego!) I couldn't wait to finish it.

The green cover edition looks a lot better. It may even have increased my reading pleasure if I'd been holding that edition. This cover features a boy who looks a few years older than Percy. It may be just the angle, but I don't think so. The green cover seems to depict a younger boy looking more vulnerable, which is a better fit and increases sympathy for the main character. Amazing, the power of a cover image... Maybe it's just me :-)

No, but seriously, I am not judging this book by its cover. I read it all the way through so that I could pass a fair judgement. I found it very thin, lacking in literary skill and that indefinable quality, charm. The preoccupation with the worst of US commercialism was very alienating. Such a shame. I studied classical civilisations at Uni and enjoy the original material enormously. I just didn't find it appealing in that setting. Too many tin cans, arcade games and guns. Ick!"
141,1,"I had been looking forward to this story so much, and it was just such a disappointment. Percy's voice felt so forced, the possible incredible world of the Gods was never developed, and every character was undeveloped. One minute Percy is talking about how lonely he is at the camp and the next he is gone and talking about how sad he is to leave. Everything was so rushed in the narrative - it felt like an endless series of action scenes thrown together with the barest hint of a real story behind them. Percy was only at his camp for a week (!!?!?!?!!) when he is sent on his quest. Yes - this boy has just found out he is a demi-god and has trained for one whole week and will now easily handle every monster sent his way; and just like that, he's on par with Theseus and Hercules. OK. What a missed opportunity to develop a world! I know it's not fair, but I couldn't help comparing this to Harry Potter - and Percy's world was so empty when placed next to Harry, Hogwarts, Hagrid, Dumbledore, the Weasleys..."
142,1,"Realize I am swimming upstream against the huge majority who really love this (so maybe I am truly missing the point) but this was just a huge miss for me.

The entirety felt like a desperate reconstruction of Harry Potter, and the umpteen similarities and out-right rip-offs pulled me out of a story that felt too thin to begin with, about a character I just couldn't connect to.

Percy has no emotional architecture. He says he's sad when his mother (seems to) die, but we don't feel it, he just carries on, biz as usual. Then he says he's a rebel and a 'bad kid' but...again we never see it. He doesn't really question anything fantastical that happens - ""Hey, I just killed my mean teacher with a sword that came outta nowhere. Pass the beer nuts"" - up to and including why his mother, depicted as some sort of saint, married someone as repugnant as Gabe.

So...apologies to anyone who is a Percy Jackson fanatic - I am you love it; we're to love books & stories & characters - but this one was just a huge disappointment to me."
143,1,"I know, I know, I know. I bet most of you are coming across this and thinking, ""How dare she give this...this...beautiful book a one-star review! Does she even know how big the fandom is?""
Yes...yes I do unfortunately, I live with people in the fandom. The reason that I'm giving this a one star review is...well...okay. First of all, I don't think that it has a great plot or was executed well. The idea was cool, especially because I love Greek mythology. It just seemed like the book does well...this.

Fake ex. ""We had just fought the big-headed monster. Then came another monster. Remember when I said the big-headed monster was the scariest monster ever. Well I had been wrong. This was the biggest monster EVER! I didn't know how I was gonna' live! Oh, wait...I defeated it.""

(This happens again for the rest of the book.)

The book also isn't written well. It uses language like ""real bad"" and it uses words that don't sound good in fight scenes (which make up the books.)

Overall, I just really don't like the Percy Jackson books."
144,1,"i was impressed until i read a bit more. it started to get more and more boring, then i just decided to put in never read again bin at home. i was impressed at the good text.. until i met the monsters.

i love Greek/Roman mythology! great books if they have myths, i know, right? But the (i forgot, read this november of 2020, correct me!) centaurs seemed like copying off Harry Potter and Pegasus, even though I knew it was a character from a myth. harry potter and pegasus are the best book series ever, in my opinion (other than wof), and if i think its copying of them, its in the dump immediately.

also, the movies are weird. everyones saying that, even the percy jackson fans-- but that just makes the book worse.

i got recommended by a librarian at barnes and nobles, and since everybody thought it was the best thing in the world, i decided to get book 1. everybody has different opinions, and thats mine. i watched two percy jackson movies, and that made the first book even more horrible. worst book."
145,1,
146,1,"This book is so frustrating.

I felt like I had ADHD as I was reading it, which, by the way, is NOT a clever plot device, it's just an annoying trait added to Percy in a desperate attempt to make him realistic.

No sooner would they stumble upon a bad guy than finish them off. It was too easy. I was bored, when I shouldn't have been. This happened frequently. So frequently in fact, I stood back and thought about how ridiculous it was. The entire novel is a ridiculous farce of pseudo-quests.

Despite its fast pace, Riordan felt it necessary to allude to a future event that happened maybe a page (read paragraph) later. ""This character seems odd. OH NOES, IT WANTS TO KILL ME!""

Worst of all, this CHILDREN'S book CONDONES MURDER. It does this quite explicitly, in fact, and makes no attempt to try and solve a (sadly) common real-life problem without resorting to violence. I was repulsed and horrified.

I begged for it to end."
147,1,"I normally adore young adult fiction, but this book didn't do it for me at all. I have never been as bored by a book in my life. I would go into more detail, except that would require me to waste more time on this terrible, terrible book.

- It's duplicative of Harry Potter.
- Percy is a total snooze and I was rooting for him to fail. In fact, it's quite an achievement that Riordan was able to make something so fascinating and exciting--Greek mythology, for [redacted] sake!--so tedious.
- It's ridiculous to say that this book should be graded on a curve because it was aimed at 10-year-olds. Good children's literature is enjoyable for all ages; in fact, it often becomes even more enjoyable when you read it as an adult because you pick up on themes that went over your head when you were younger. That doesn't happen here.

Read it at your own risk. If I could I would give this 0 stars."
148,1,"Mehh... Que desperdicio de tiempo, es lo aburrido que leí en mi vida. Muy tonto, se que es para adolescentes pero es tan ñoño... No me gustó nada y no conecté con la historia."
149,1,"The Lighning Theif was an almost exact replica of the Harry Potter sereis. What I mean by that is that there is some kind of ""bad guy"", Percy has lost both of his parents, a lot of characters, he got a scar in the end, and in the cover is both dragon teeth (basically the teeth in Harry Potter were he destroyed a horrocrux) and a sword (Godric Gryffindors sword Harry fought with)!

Overall this book is messy with action and sophisticated to understand. Dont recommend this book a tiny bit if you have read the Harry Potter seires because again almost an exact replica. Even if you havent read it, read the ""original"" first (Harry Potter sereis not Percy Jackson books)!

Note to the Writer of The Lighning Theif:
""Next time you want to write a proper series of books make sure you use imagination of your own kind not somebody elses, that is what can maybe make you famous like JK Rowling!

150,1,"I am noticing a pattern in Tween books where the author thinks that because his/her book is based on some preposterous premise, that this gives the author liberty to ignore all sense of reason. The premise in this book is that the main character, Percy, is part-Greek god or somesuch. In the first chapter, his class is at a museum for a fieldtrip, during which one of his teachers turns into a monster, tries to kill him, and ends up being killed by Percy. Later, he wonders if he imagined the whole thing. Then, his mom dies, but he's not upset about it because he thinks he'll be able to find her in the Underworld. Come on. Where's the emotional development of the character(s)? The book just races from one action sequence to another. It's like an action movie with very little substance. Very disappointing. I couldn't finish it."
151,1,"Percy Jackson is really done it this time. After getting kicked out of boarding school he fins out something very shocking. He is a demi-god, which means a child of a god and human. His father is Poseidon, the god of the sea. He goes to a camp to be safe that is called camp half-blood, where monsters can't find them. He has been accused of stealing Zues's Lightning Bolt. He and Annabeth are sent to retrieve it from Hades.
I can make a text to text connection. Some kids have no idea who their parents are, they may live with them but they are either not getting the love that every child ought to get or their parents have no time for children.
I gave this book 1 star. The book starts out really fun and exciting but then everything slow down and it takes you FOREVER to read it. I reccomend it to people who liek SI-Fi"
152,1,"I normally try to fight to the end of the book no matter how bad it is, but this one, I couldn't finish and had to stop. While I loved Harry Potter and did seem the similarities between the two, that wasn't a problem for me. I realized that I had no interest in the mythology story line. I felt like I needed a cheat sheet to tell me what the different creatures and gods were. The writing style was just amateurish – this is supposed to be a “young adult” book, so it shouldn’t be written like a kindergarten story! Percy’s confrontation in the beginning with his “teacher” was so lackluster that I thought I had skipped over a part but no, it was just that uneventful. I tried to keep going but then finally decided I didn't want to waste my time. I’ll stick to Harry Potter – this series is not for me!"
153,1,
154,1,"I felt a bit duped because of the book's mostly-good reviews, but then again, I did pick the book randomly while feeling nostalgic for Harry Potter, the reason that I still check out young adult books. (And that I love Greek history and mythology, but that's not here or there). Unfortunately, the setup and plot of this were too simplistic and not engaging, and I couldn't like any character despite trying. Recommended for elementary readers, probably not junior high though.

Perhaps I'm simply too old for this book, but I enjoyed and before, not to mention book 1 and recently (the latter after I read this book), which are all very appropriate for kids and great books to boot. And this books is a bit too similar to for me. So 1 star it is."
155,1,"My friend recommended this to me because I love Harry Potter. I found this to be TOO similar to Harry Potter, to the point of even annoying. I mean, a trio of 2 guys and a girl go away to a magical place to learn how to use magic/powers. (The girl is the smart one, the main character comes from a home where he doesn't quite fit in, [and also has a ""unusual trait"" that foreshadows his magical powers] and the other guy friend is the funny, quirky one.)They are sorted into different house upon arrival, and there are inner house competitions. A nasty blond kid is the bully to our main character, and there are also half-bloods. (People who are not truly magical) Then the main character finds out about a prophecy where he will be the one to kill the most powerful evil force in the modern world. I mean come on Rick!!!!!!"
156,1,"The book that I read is called the The Lightning Thief. It is about a twelve year old boy that finds out that he is half god and stuff. He also goes to a camp for kids just like him pretty much like xmen. except not really but kinda. Wall he is in this camp he finds out he is the son of poseidon wooow what a surprise. And in the end he gets the stuff back. The reason that I did rate this book really low is because it wasn't hard enough and it was kind of boring and it was weird. I would recommend this to nobody because it was not the greatest book that I have read but is was bad so don't read it. but I would recommend this book to people who like vanilla ice and to the nike factory and also trix are for kids also show respect at all times. ""You cant change your past but you can change your future"" giggity giggity gigggity alright."
157,1,"I'm currently at 46% on Kindle, but I'm not sure if I'll finish.
I kept trying to read more since it has so many positive reviews and is recommended for Harry Potter fans -- I wanted to see if it would redeem itself later on. I liked some of the ideas --
ability to read Greek letters = dyslexic when comes to reading English, etc, but the plot/writing so far is only ok (there definitely are holes in logic) and the writing level is no where near JK Rowling's level. The characters aren't well-developed and seem like very shallow versions of Harry Potter characters.

(Percy = Harry
Grover = Ron
Annabeth = annoying version of Hermione)

Also, none of the adults in the camp for half-bloods bother to explain anything. Monsters/quests/whatever just get randomly thrown in without explanation. Not enough world-building!"
158,1,"I must say, this one started off great. I was immediately enjoying it. I can’t tell you where exactly but somewhere along the way, maybe when Percy made it to Camp Half-Blood, I started losing interest. Maybe I’m too much of a Harry Potter fan and felt it was trying too hard to be like HP but also not be like HP so it wouldn’t be noticeable that it’s trying to be just like HP. Maybe I love originality, but I was relieved to finish reading this book. I wasn’t a fan of the writing style and I don’t understand how Percy, Grover, and Annabeth became the greatest of friends. There was no growth in their friendship. It felt forced, in my opinion. I didn’t care about the characters. I wanted to like it, especially since I had high hopes in the beginning. The plot wasn’t a shock—I figured it out as soon as Percy received his prophecy. This just wasn’t for me."
159,1,"I don't recommend this book at all.
I only started reading it because it could help me at school. Really it is time wasting. It annoyed me how similar to Harry Potter this was, and not in the good way. Black haired 12 year old with green eyes? Sounds familiar? And not only that. A poor written, cheap copy of Harry Potter.
Don't get me started on the Greek mythology. How could Athena have children? How? She swore when she was borned out of Zeus's head that she will forever be a maid, same as Artemis. But guess what? Suddenly Athena broke her oath, and not once. One of the things Athena was known (apart from the fact that she was the goddess of wisdom, war tactics and so on) for swearing that she will be a maid forever. But I guess Rick Riordan couldn't have found some other goddess.

I really don't want to offend the fans, but this is my opinion."
160,1,"You could tell when you read this that it's meant for viewers of around the age of 12, which a little bothered me, but otherwise the story was pretty interesting. I love mythology and it seemed like Riordan was trying to teach the readers about it a bit. In some areas I think it was a bit unrealistic. Like how easy it was for Percy to hurt the God of War, Ares. His friends, Grover and Annabeth practically did nothing during the whole quest, they seemed like just support. I hope the movie isn't too over exaggerated.

However I will be reading the rest of the series. I think it is just hard for authors to make a story interesting when you have an oracle tell you what's going to happen in the beginning."
161,1,"this is an unfair review. This book did not really deserve a rating of 1 star, just a bad match between book and reader.

I'm 42. The book is clearly a junior/young adult book, and while I and many other adults enjoy many of the books in this genre, I didn't feel this one worked well as an adult read. I found it boring and didn't finish it. It didn't have the depth, layers or detail of a book like The Golden Compass or the Harry Potter series. However, kudos to the author for making Greek myths popular with young boys. At the time this came out I was working in the children's book section of a bookstore, not only was this series very popular with 8-12 year olds (mainly boys), but they also came in looking for non-fiction on Greek mythology."
162,1,"I kept flipping back and forth between giving this book 1/2 stars as I read it. honestly I LOVE Greek/Roman mythology one of my strong suits so I figured this would be a good read. about 30 pgs in I could sense I wouldn't like it; too easy, omitting facts, etc. percy was supposed to be an awful student so how does he always have a sudden spark of unexplained knowledge. I thought diction was far too easy, only reason I read it was bc it went by so fast. also, I don't understand why the author sped certain things up (ie, diner and arcade scenes). but my real issue with the book is that long before percy meets each important character or god, I knew what was going to happen several pgs ahead of time. not worth the read if you ask me it's simply an elementary approach to Greek mythology"
163,1,"Twaddle. Complete twaddle. More than that, it's poorly disguised derivative twaddle. Percy has black hair and green eyes. Hmmmm--where have we seen that before? He doesn't know he has special powers, though strange things have happened to him his entire life. Dark beings from a dark world want to kill him. And he finds all this out as he enters adolescence.

Puh-leese. We've seen this before, and done so much better. The writing is so choppy I nearly got seasick. The characters, including Percy, are poorly drawn and unlikable. Bad, bad, bad. I gave it 60 pages--a generous 20 more than my ""40 page rule"" allows--before snapping it shut and flinging it aside, even though it is a library book.

Twaddle. I'd give it zero stars if I could."
164,1,"Sorry middle school girls everywhere, I was not a fan of Percy Jackson. The book was just full of super random things happening - oh, now we're in a hotel that traps people forever - and I refuse to believe that Percy and the gang just happen to stumble upon all of the gods that happen to be hiding out in the US. It was just all too much to me, and I'm a big fan of invented universes (Hello, Harry Potter series!). Also, all of the ""obstacles"" the three travelers overcome seem super obvious and easy. Like, I could overcome those obstacles and my dad's just a printer. I have absolutely no desire to read the rest of the books in the series or see the movie. Sorry Rick, but The Lightning Thief would not make my book of top 100 anything."

*1 star - I'm not really commenting on anything besides, this book failed in the most basic function of being readable enough that I finished reading it.
**2 star - Well, at least I finished it. Though it might've been tough. Maybe stopped and came back to it a few times. May also have many other flaws
***3 star - A solid work. Read it straight through without needing to force myself to finish. Probably still a number of flaws.
****4 star - An excellent work. If you enjoy the genre, I would definitely recommend this
*****5 star - Everyone, everywhere should read this. (As an adult maybe.) You can't find anything better."
167,1,"After years of hearing how great this series is, I decided to buy a copy for my kids, and read it myself.
No thank you.
1. I'm not interested in a book for children that glorifies adultery.
2. The ""soul of Western civilization is in America."" ??? And our hero is trying to protect that, at another point the camper who is revealed as the villain is said to be ""trying to destroy the Western world.""
In case anyone didn't realize the capital W there makes this book thinly veiled white supremacist garbage.
3. It's so ridiculous. The pink poodle, the Barbara Walters interview, the arcade hotel, the water park, Ares using the word ""punk"" constantly.
It's easy to say that I actually hated this book."
168,1,"I love Greek Mythology and I've been brought up in the cultural beliefs. This book isn't it.

Rick Riordan is very sexist. The girl characters Percy doesn't like are all described as ugly and masculine, and it was pushed to a point that the reader needs to know that masculine traits in a girl or a woman means that she is evil... sure...
Not only that, but Rick Riordan would push this point across, every time he saw a demigod of Ares. I don't know if you know this Riordan.... but demigods are not considered ugly...

In Greek mythology, the demigods are described with having ichor running through their veins (the golden blood of the gods) so that means they are golden in appearance, hair, eyes, and skin making the demigods extremely attractive to the human eye..."
169,1,I hated every second of reading that book.
170,1,"An original take on Greek mythology but it was a long haul. I have to say the movie was better. The book felt so childish and I wouln't reccommend it to teenages i really wanted more to the battle scenes. Some of the action was a bit hard to follow too, especially when you're falling asleep with bordom. Sadly the characters were unlovable especially Annabeth she could really get on the nerves and sometimes I felt as if Percy were a bit stupid. The only valuable character was Grover and even then I couldn't quite figure him out. A bit of a dissapointment really considering how great the movie is. I guess I've learnt not to watch the movie before reading the books."
171,1,"My opinion is not entirely fair. This story is clearly aimed at young teenagers, which I am not anymore, so I should've known better.. But I picked it up a while ago to see what it was about and all I can say is that I should have read this when I was 14. I probably would have thought it was exciting and clever. Unfortunately (or: thank god) I've changed a bit since I was 14 and now I expect a bit more from a story. Where Harry Potter, the Hobbit or the BFG are children's stories that can also be enjoyed by adults, this is a young teenager's story that can only be enjoyed by young teenagers. I do however recommend it to them, because I really think I would have loved it at that age."
172,1,"I really wanted to like this book because I love Greek/Roman mythology and it seemed like a modern-day twist on it would be interesting. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with the story overall. The main character is not a very good role model and many situations in the story seem inappropriate for the age-group that it's aimed at. But let's face it, Greek/Roman mythology really isn't appropriate for younger children in the first place so I guess that's the first problem. There were some clever parts with modern-day versions of ancient characters but overall it was pretty lame. I may still read the rest of the series and see if it gets any better, though."
173,1,"I thought this book was terrible. Yes. I mean it. I don't like Percy Jackson.
Before I continue, I need to say a few things: Although I didn't like this book, I respect the author. Rick Riordan has a lot of writing talent. What I do not respect is the way that he used his talents for this book.
Greek mythology has never been my thing. I really don't like it, so when I finally gave in and read this one; I didn't expect to like it. So, if anyone ever hears me say I don't like Percy Jackson, that is why. And that is my opinion and I will stick with it. But Rick Riordan is a good writer."
174,1,"This was the worst book ever. I could not even finish the story, because it was 100% the worst novel in all history, that it could not even be classified as a novel. THank you Rick RIordan for ruining my fourth grade experience as a reader, and playing the role as the most discouraging author in all history of books which I have ever read. I hope that you put more thought into your next book, or do not write one. This was a plagiarism to greek authors like Homer, who created fables and stories that depicted the Greek gods, and then you made it into your own writing, and passed it off as your own."
175,1,
176,1,"Oh dear! What is with me and well-loved books? I seem to love those the least! ‘The Lightning Thief’ didn’t steal my heart. It didn’t even steal a minute’s space on my memory shelf. I started off reading it without knowing much of Greek mythology and that was a mistake because to read this, you do need a fair bit of understanding of all the Greek Gods and their stories. I didn’t. Still, I ploughed on womanfully. Mistake. I can’t take well to books that read like fast-action movies. I get a headache. This was just like a James Bond thriller combined with the Hobbits. I was glad to reach the predictable end."
177,1,"I kind of hated this book. Of course, I'm not a 12-year-old boy, nor am I interested in mythology. If I were either of the two, I might like it better. Instead, I'm a grown woman who loves to read well-written books that show me things instead of telling me. This book is not that book. It's terribly predictable, and it seems that Riordan tried his darnedest to cram Greek god stuff onto every page. Tip to the author: there doesn't have to be a near-death experience in every scene. I speed-read the last 100 pages just to be done with it."
178,1,"Stupid book, Rick Riodan's writing style reminds me of that of a ten year olds. It was entirely pointless, the plot was not only implausible but it was boring, and hard to follow. The ridiculous banter and dialog between the young children in the book turned me off to it even more. They are only like, twelve, and they do not make for interesting characters. I found them all very flat. There was no meaning to the book, it was just cheap action, and the Greek references were way beyond the target audience."
179,1,"I read this book because I had to, not because I wanted to. I honestly had no desire to read it, and my suspicions were right. It was a very mediocre read, and I probably wouldn't even have read it if I had been the same age as the book. Not only was it predictable, it had crude slap-stick comedy. Seriously, exploding toilets or something like that? I do like the original intent...kids with disabilities maybe having more to them...a special power or whatnot. It is an ice idea, but I just couldn't enjoy this book on any level."
180,1,"So, I couldn't finish this, even though I got pretty far. It might have been better if I read it instead of listening to the audio book. I would still recommend it to young readers, I mean it's been popular so it must have something going for it. I just really disliked the tone, and especially read aloud I got tired of Percy's narration. I couldn't get into the action. My mind wandered and I wasn't interested enough to rewind. Does the series get better? I love the idea, but the execution of it was disappointing."
181,1,"DNF

I tried this one a while back and haven't managed to pick it up again. Percy managed to rub off on my the wrong way, especially between his humor, and his lack of maturity.

I remember being especially appalled by his rudeness to his stepfather, although I remember the stepfather being quite horrible, I still found Percy's actions incredibly immature.

I also found his crush on Annabelle rather puzzling, they are not super closely related, but they are what? Cousins? Second cousins? I don't know.

I guess it wasn't for me. Ah well."
182,1,"0.5 stars
This book was very overhyped do not recommend I've read better lame rather would read Harry Potter the original not the copy. I don't understand why you would learn Greek mythology in Latin class and chiron is a really crappy latin teacher because Latin and Greek are two completely different languages,cultures and mythology


Camp half blood is a torture camp for kids and I Hated this book and it hurt me really really bad NEVER READ IT OR BUY THIS BOOK MOST OVERHYPED BOOK OF THE MILLENIA"
183,1,"I understand that this series is middle grade, so of course it's going to be a little simpler and a little more predictable, but that's no excuse for poor writing and poor plotting. Middle graders deserve well-written literature too - and of course they HAVE a ton of great options! I have to believe this series is hugely popular because of the really awesome concept...the execution of that concept is *not good*.

I also really disliked the actor for the audiobook. I'd probably finish this one if I were reading it, but I'm not willing to devote 5 more hours of listening."
184,1,"this book is trash. i know YA can be a dicey genre, but i mean, jesus christ. this is the most hamfisted attempt to modernize greek mythology that i've ever had the misfortune to encounter. and the writing is SO POOR. when i think of YA, i assume the writing is geared towards teenagers, but quite honestly, i think my toddler would be insulted if i tried to read this to him and quickly insist we get back to 'this little president', which is better written and far more entertaining AND educational."
185,1,This book is a waste of my time. Still haven't found a book that I like. I thought that the main character. Would always ask a question. No one would answer his question. I thought that was annoying because why even ask that if now one will answer it. I found it confusing because one second he is fighting a teacher with a pen. Then there in a car driving in a storm. I find it funny that his mom couldn't beat a monster but a kid with know idea of his powers beats it. That is most of why I do not like this book.
186,1,"Wow. Two back-to-back books in a row I did not like very much. But this one, was the worst. I know it is tremendously popular. And, I read a LOT of YA Fantasy but this one was just so...so something. Characters without depth and feeling, no deeper meaning in the plot (which all the best Fantasy books always seem to have...with Harry Potter being supremely wonderful at achieving), and, by the last third of the book, just trying to get through to the end. Can understand how 3rd & 4th grade readers (and above) might like it who do not expect more than superficial ""action"" in a book."
187,1,"DID NOT FINISH

I rarely stop a book in the middle, but very early into this reading, I realized that the book wasn't for me. I like Greek Mythology quite a bit, but the writing style is so tailored towards a younger audience that I couldn't read on. I considered giving the first book a chance to see if the writing matured, but then I realized that I would inevitably want to read on in this series, so I decided that this experience would not be a good use of my time.

I liked the two movies based on these books OK, but I have only seen them once each."
188,1,"I don't like fantasy in general, but I read this because my daughter had to read it for school and needed some help. This is a complete ripoff of Harry Potter with a skin of Greek mythology. The voice and writing style was done in a way that the author clearly was playing for this to be made into a movie. I felt like it was written as a money-maker and the plot and action were forced, and I don't like being played for someone's wallet. The only redeeming factor was that I love Greek mythology so I liked being reintroduced to the Greek gods & personalities."
189,1,"I can't believe I got to the end of this book. I hated it. I bought the series to give to my nephews (and I read most of the books I buy for them before I hand them over) but I feel bad for them and only hope they end up loving it despite the crap this story is full of. If they don't like it, I will understand why.

It was so boring and the narrator just had annoying voices for each character, so this didn't help the book.

If you decide to read this series, I hope you end up like it more than those of us who gave it a low score."
190,1,"HOW COULD ANYONE BE OKAY WITH THIS BOOK. My seven year old started to read this book, and it's not appropriate for my sweet little angel. I live in a Christian, God-abiding household and this atrocity is going to damage my child's mind. The idea that there is more than one God is a sin, and this book is promoting the will of the Devil. Anyways, I hope this author learns how harmful his view are because I cannot condone this type of behavior in my life. I'm not okay with this at all in the least."
191,1,"I'm clearly not the audience for this book, but I decided to read it anyways because of the high reviews and a personal recommendation from someone I know. I thought that despite the fact it might be written for a younger audience, it might have an appeal to older readers similar to the charm of Harry Potter. I was wrong. The book was irritating. It was especially irritating when you just finished several books on Greek mythology. This book butchers the classic Greek mythology and attempts to modernize it.

I can't understand why this series is so overrated."
192,1,"I read this to Spencer in the car as we commuted back and forth from seeing the cousins. He liked it, I thought it was L-A-M-E. Seriously, terrible. Maybe it would have been better if I had read it to myself, some books are like that, but I was not impressed at all. My biggest pet peeve with the book was that the bad guy would totally explain himself before trying to off the hero. This happened more than once. I am not a fan."
193,1,"I read this book because it was fairly popular among a lot of my older students and they would often talk about it. Generally the kids spoke highly of it, so I wanted to read it to be able to talk to them about it. I ended up listening to this one on tape while commuting, and didn't really enjoy it. I can see how kids, studying Greek mythology would enjoy it. But to me, the book just dragged on and on and didn't hold my attention at all. Oh well."
194,1,"Riordan writing is poor. He obviously doesn't know when to be funny (he is not) or when to create suspense (there is some, but Percy's I-know-I-can't-die-it's-just-first-book narration kills it). Plot is too simple, 50% of a book consists of ""pick a mythical creature, let it attack Percy, Percy defeats it/escapes"" scenario over and over. Book ends with murder, but it's not a bad guy who kills someone but an adult and, which is most puzzling, Riordan expect reader to be cheerful about it."
195,1,"Don't waste your time! You can guess the entire story just by looking at the cover. Yes, just like Harry Potter, he is the unwilling chosen hero to save the world. Pretty much delivers the satisfaction of power and revenge a kid would want in a book--meaning, it's not sophisticated. I read this before the movie and thought he wrote aiming to get bought and turned into a movie. Lots of action, caricatured characters so anyone can easily understand, thin enough to not bore."
196,1,"I admit it, I can't even finish this. I can't get past the voice of the main character who sounds like a grown up trying too hard (and failing miserably) to sound like a kid. Add that to the lack of a realistic response by the kid to all these weird things that are happening to him, and I can go no further. I was pre-reading this for my 7.5 year old who is finishing up Harry Potter. Harry Potter this is not. Too bad I purchased this and can't just return it to the library!"
197,1,"Average at best, ridiculously juvenile in some places. A book meant for readers far younger to me, I guess. At least, I hope that is what the intended target audience was. Otherwise, well.. Let's not go there, shall we.. I could tear into this book, right here right now, but I REALLY believe it was intended for younger readers. And no, I am NOT going to read the other gawd-knows-how-many parts, thank you very much."
198,1,"I can't stand the first person POV. I don't give a shit about half the crap he worries about. And I didn't like how Grover didn't tell him important shit in the beginning. What an ass. And Annabeth is just a bitch. She doesn't want to be Percy's friend because of dumb ass family drama between their parents? Seriously? Parents who abandoned them, like why are you paying tribute to them?
Overall good storyline, just lame characters."
199,1,"This was the first book by Rick Riordan that I have read, or rather part read, and I am afraid it will be the last. I have read reviews comparing this book to the Harry Potter books, but in my opinion to do so is a huge insult to J.K.Rowling. I managed to get 47% of the way through the book, and believe me that was a struggle. When I get into a book I usually find it difficult to put it down. In this case I found it difficult to find sufficient enthusiasm to pick the thing up."
200,1,"This is the only one of the series that I've read, and I didn't expect it to a children's books when I picked it up. Honestly, with such a neat idea, it could have been made into a great adult oriented book. Maybe I'm being selfish, wanting to steal it from pre-teens. The concept of children being borne of Olympian gods, it could have been way more brutal and badass than just a camp for half bloods. But this is my discerning and very picky opinion, take it with a slight grain of salt."
201,1,I didn't like this book because I am not very familiar with greek mythology. It has to much mythology and is very confusing if you don't know your facts. I definitely would not recommend this unless you really know about greek gods and goddesses.I prefer the other series Rick Riordan wrote that is called The Heroes of Olympus. While this book has greek mythology it does not have as much and I think it is a much better book.
202,1,"This book was pretty stupid. When Percy arrives at camp, everyone acts like he should know things, as if they don't understand that he's the new kid that just found out he's the son of a Greek god. The gods can see and know so much of what is happening, unless it's inconvenient for the story. Percy falls into obvious traps, even mentioning that he shouldn't trust anyone, but he trusts them anyway. I could go on and on, but basically, the story was flimsy and most of the characters were idiots."
203,1,"Read it because my year six boys were reading it and had had some difficulty retaining the plot...their fault not the authors. I am just not into Greek legends etc, and found the writing a bit lame. But at least I can discuss the plot with my students and perhaps redirect them to other reading. I suspect they too are unfamiliar with the world of myth and legend and therefore found the twists in the plot difficult."
204,1,"This is a pretty good book for those who are into Greek and Roman mythology and action. Its about a boy who finds out that all his life was a lie and he is actually a demigod who is protected by his best friend Grover. This leads him back to a special camp for demigods in which he is sent on a quest to bring back the lightning bolt and save the world from a battle between gods. I would say, overall it is a pretty well written book. I just don't believe it to be of interest to me."
205,1,"I thought that the Greek mythology premise was quite interesting, which kept me reading until the end. I will probably keep reading the series through to the end. But I thought that the characters were so boring and dull.

Most of the Interesting things about the book seemed to be a complete rip-off from Harry Potter, the characters, Teams, chosen child etc.

I would say 2/5 stars. Hopefully the sequels are better!"
206,1,"I didn't like this book.I tried to get into mythology as my classmate Bryan recommend this book to me.I did not like it.It was very challenging and hard.I kept getting confused,I didn't know what was happening.The books were also not my type.Overall, if you are not into the mythology type of books but want to try something new I recommend you don't, just stay with the topic you usually read about."
207,1,"All action and no character development. That's how I would describe this book. It felt like epic battle after battle with very little back story. I found myself not caring what happened to the main characters because I had not developed an emotional attachment to them. I listened to this as an audiobook and because I was not into it, I found it REALLY hard to not to daydream about something else while listening."
208,1,I found this a pretty decent book and I have found myself kind of wanting to read the next four. Despite its few flaws I enjoyed certain aspects and like how Rick added in a few environmental messages about litter and how kids spend ages on video games. I didnt't like the fact of how long it was when it could've been a bit shorter but I suppose that's because it's the first book and needs to set a few things up like the cool and interesting plot.
209,1,"This is my live review as I read the book.

Chapter 1
A 12 year old boy says he is a half-blood. The students in his school take Latin.

The things being discussed in this book make me feel too old to be reading it. Someone is described as eating a peanut butter and ketchup sandwich. I am sure kids will have some humorous reaction to that, but I just want to put the book down and leave it for them to enjoy."
210,1,"I don't understand why it is so popular... That camp half-blood felt like a bad version of Hogwarts and the characters were damn annoying and one-dimensional (I hated the female protagonist the most)
The writing style was simple and childish, and I read it when I was quite young and even liked shit like Twilight
The plot is very predictable and I couldn't recall any plot-twists
I gave it to my (back then) ten year old sister and even she thought of the protagonists as annoying"
211,1,"I truly don’t understand why this is so popular. I think the premise is great, but it’s so poorly written I’m astounded this author is so popular. As a librarian I’m embarrassed that I’ve been recommending this (based on the recommendation of other librarians and library resources)....At some point I may try a different series by this author to try and give them another chance, but until then, I think I’ll have to offer an alternative to kids!"
212,1,Parents beware! I have read this author as an adult and for the most part had to ignore the numerous type-o's from Disney. But then the author decided to jump on the gay parade and made one of the kids gay through NO character development. The character never showed any propensity of being gay but was dealing with grief and hero worship. Severally disappointed in Disney and Rick Riordan. So sad as he showed such promise. I do not recommend this series as safe for kids.
213,1,"Lots and lots of teen and pre-teen books are great for adults too; this is not one of those books. Severely lacking in continuity, character motivation, dialogue... You name it. All aimed straight at the sensibilities and world view of an 11 year old boy. The Greek myth background is fun and has tons of potential, but is just so hacked together that it is really just a hash.

So... perhaps a great kids book but I can't recommend it at all. Zero stars."
214,1,"I was recommended this book by my friend's Lil brother, he warned me that people who usually like wizarding ward don't end up liking this book, I wanted to give it a try to see whether the assumption is true or not.
Unfortunately, the assumption is turning into a reality. The first part that is chapters 1-9 is slow for me, the book does not evoke any sense of curiousness. I might pick up the book again but right now it's difficult for me to keep on reading the book."
215,1,"Instead of being like ""If you're different, that's fine, there really is no such thing as ""normal"" and you're not any less of a person"" this book is like ""Have a mental illness or disability? Have you considered you might be a DEMI-GOD???""

If there were evidence for demi-gods this may be a reasonable line of thinking, but with the current scientific understanding I'd say it's an unhealthy point of view."
216,1,"I am just going to directly quote from the essay I wrote about this book in sixth grade, because I feel like that says it all. ""Rick Riordan, a dull and lousy author, has somehow turned the riveting, enthralling topic of the Greek gods into a predictable and utterly humdrum novel titled The Lightning Thief."" ""Percy Jackson is a bit like a knock-off Harry Potter."" ""In conclusion, this book failed to differentiate itself in any way from the vast majority of children’s novels."""

218,1,"DNF. I regret wasting audible credit on this book. YA fantasy is one of my favorite genres (in my 40s), but this book failed to capture me. Simplistic storylines and paper-thin characterizations do not a good book make. I disliked the author’s take on Greek mythology and how the “gods” were randomly based in America because apparently American culture is the epitome of Western civilization or something like that. Moving on…"
219,1,"I could not finish this book; I forget how far I got, but I was not at all interested. It didn't really offer anything new on the 'orphan with powerful biological parent' theme, and I didn't care what happened. Maybe the series gets better, but I won't likely try to read another one in the series. Or maybe I was just having a bad day."
220,1,"I had heard great things about this series, but I was really disappointed. It reminded me of the goosebumps series (I only got through half of one). The writing was so dumbed down, and I hate that in kids literature. The Greek Mythology woven in was fun, but it could have been great... and it just wasn't. I'll pass on reading this to my boys."
221,1,Rarely ever do I not finish a book that I start reading. This one I have decided I don't care about Percy or any other character in the book. I understand that this is a young adult novel but the writing is very simplistic. I was hoping to find a character that I cared about like Harry Potter or at least good writing and I found neither in this book.
222,1,"I heard that the movie on this book was coming out soon so I decided to read this. Not a Harry Potter book, but a Harry Potter wanna be. I didn't feel that it was very well written and it had a slow beginning. I was into the book 100 pages before it turned interesting. The book was ok but I wouldn't read it again and don't care if I read any of the others in the series."
223,1,"We really need to expect more from literature. And can't we please have a character who actually solves his own problems instead of everything happening Deus-ex-machina? The premise was good, but it felt like the writer just whipped this out without working it up at all. I'm not going to be reading the next ones. There are just much better books out there. The dyslexia stuff was funny though :)."
224,1,boringgg. i read some and then put it down because of boredom. ZzZzZz most of the time. it's too much back and forth. one minute they're killing medusa next their going someplace then 2 seconds after medusa this dog lady comes. i have no intention of reading the rest of the series and donnot reccomend this book.
225,1,"This book is a lame Harry Potter rip off! Point by point: ""Um, wizards are taken, so this kid'll be the son of a god!"" ""Uh, he needs two friends to go with him on adventures--a scaredy-cat guy friend, and a super smart girl pal!"" The sole redeeming feature is Percy's refreshingly down-to-earth first person narration. His self-awareness is a good model of writing for teen students."
226,1,"I listened to the audio version of this. I think this is a classic example of how the wrong reader can butcher a book. I have friends that really liked it, but they way it was read…horrible! Every flaw, every nuance, every unnecessary story repeat shone like a bright street light. Do not listen to the audio version."
227,1,This book is great because the kid is half human and he have a weapon that is like a pencil and the pencil is powerful.He is like the god of water he have a father and his father is cool.He have a friend that he control light and the important things is in the end of the book because the kig fight his friend but the kid of water was nice and he wins the fight.
228,1,"I did not enjoy this book. The premise is exciting, but the execution is terrible. And I'd feel this way even if it weren't completely copying the Harry Potter formula at every turn.

My 7-year-old son is enjoying the book, although he can't fully grasp the complex Greek mythology. I will be interested to see if he wants to read the other books in the series. I certainly don't."
229,1,"Bleh. The idea was interesting enough, but I thought it was executed very poorly, which is a shame because I LOOOOVE Greek mythology. I also found it so predictable that I wanted to skim. All in all, this is one of those books where I actually thought the movie made parts better. haha. Unfortunately, I read through the whole thing hoping it would redeem itself. Never did, for me anyways."
230,1,"This story takes the main character on a journey across the U.S., but the author did not bother to look at a map or do any fact checking. For a YA novel, this is one of the most disjointed I've encountered. The story itself is intriguing, but it was poorly executed and felt incredibly shallow (from the characters to the depth of plot)."
231,1,"What not to read after finishing a semester of Classical Literature. This book botches and/or waters down most of Greek/Roman mythology. That's not a huge problem, though, even though it's annoying. I would forgive that if the story was actually compelling, but the characters are shallow, the writing grates and the plot is pretty boring."
232,1,"As one who appreciates Greek mythology, I feel obligated to at least give this book a little praise, but the reality is this: it is lame. I was never sold on the characters, every problem, battle, or situation was resolved a little too easily and neatly for me, and the voice was horribly grating.

I'm not a fan."
233,1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. I can't even write a review, I don't want to think about it. Maybe my taste has gotten too used to young adult books to go back to straight-up children's books? Not sure. I didn't find anything about this book believable, which is the first requirement for a good story."
234,1,"Exceptionally kiddy. To anyone who responds with ""duh, it's a kids' book"", I refer you to Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland, The Hobbit, The Chronicles of Narnia, etc etc. I usually like to comment on one thing that I did like about a book, which I give a poor rating to but I can't think of a single thing, except maybe the cover art."
235,1,"To be honest, I got about half way through and just lost interest.

The story line was decent, but the characters seemed unusually dense though. I mean it took the daughter of the goddess of wisdom more than 5 minutes to discover Percy's bloodline. It was obvious to me from minute one and I know almost nothing of Greek mythology.

I may pick this book up at a later date. Just not sure"
236,1,"pretty simple plot - vowed to go through this series only after i thought that fantasy fiction can be an interesting genre- well, nothing interesting about this book - its very linear - and well I guess I am not amongst the book's intended audience, but since i have started the series - i am impelled to finish it too."
237,1,"I have nothing good to say about this book. I don't think that anybody is wrong for liking this book, but I just hated it. I can't wrap my head around it but I just can't stand this book. I personally thought it was beyond boring and couldn't get myself to like it. Once again not criticizing anyone who likes this book I just don't like it."
238,1,"Quite interesting.
I did not like the repetitiveness of some events. The similarities and cliches of every middle grade book. And the predictable and unrealistic plot.-he won over the war god, really?-
Other than that, it was a meh book, I did not expect to get something out of it and I did not.
(Hades is my favorite.)"
239,1,"I heard that this book was really good and was kind of like my favorite sic-fi books, plus I like mythology, so I was like why not? I tried reading it about 3 times and got through 100 pages, and couldn't keep on going. Nothing about this book interested me. It was all so boring and I was pushing through it, hoping that it would get better, but it didn't."
240,1,"Could not stand this book for the life of me.

They literally got attacked by some sort of monster in every single chapter.

The only reason I finished it was because I made a deal with my sister that I'd read Percy Jackson if she read the Unwind Series by Neal Shusterman.

She got the better end of the deal."
241,1,I was very interested in this series for the longest time. I heard tons of great things so I gave in and bought the box set. This book was torture. I know this series is Disney and I know it's for YA but I still expected more than what it was giving me. I may be too old for this series but I could not even finish.
242,1,"My god, the Babysitters Club books were better written than this. What is this garbage. The dialogue is painfully clunky and the plot turns are embarrassingly dumb. I wish this story was handed over to an actual writer, because it is strikingly clear that Riordan has no skill or training in the matter."
243,1,"Read this only because Linzaloo has been bugging me for half a decade about it. JUST FOR YOU, LOODLES. I knew I'd wouldn't like it because I hate Greek mythology. I felt like banging my head against a wall so many times. Also, the whole trying-to-be-like-Harry Potter issue annoyed me, as I knew it would! BUT I READ IT, LINZ, OKAY?!! :D"

246,1,"Excellent idea, terrible writing and idiotic characters. Some good ideas that are never followed through, and foreshadowing that ruins absolutly everything leaving no tension at all. It reads like an okay-written fanfic. I do not recommend this book (or series) at all.

Full review on my blog:"
247,1,"it sucks ass and seems as if it was written by a five year old version of myself. There's nothing more to add except that it's overrated and if you liked this book, please comment your age and anger since i find it very amusing. thank you percy jackson, for blinding me with cringe-attacks and making my insides slowly die. :)"
248,1,"Let's compare.
1. One of the major themes that weaves through all seven Harry Potter books is the death of his parents. Percy Jackson is sad for less than a chapter.
2. Another theme that weaves through all seven Harry Potter books is the extraordinary protective power of love: the deepest magic. The Olympians?
To quote Dickens: ""Bah, humbug!"""
249,1,Honestly this was one of the worst books I’ve ever read. If I could give it zero stars that is what I would give it. Rick tried to give the gods a personality and completely failed honestly it was hard to read and now I’m going to go and read a decent book and hope I can mentally block this one out from my memories.
250,1,"DNF.
I got about a quarter through and could not finish. This seems to suit the age range of 6-9, yet even if I had read it as a child, it would not have been enjoyable for me.
It’s incredibly simplistic writing style and immature, campy humor was too much to bear.
Half my mind was asleep while reading.
Not imaginative or exciting."
251,1,"This book is not good to me because the book had no animals in it.
But I like that a mako shark is in the book.
I also like the animals in the zoo transport truck.
I would suggest the author should add King Kong and Dinosaurs in it.
I would recommend the book because it had a lion,zebra,antelope and shark."
252,1,
253,1,"I‘m sorry but that just wasn’t it. It felt like a child had written the book, the writing was just so bad. I did not feel a thing for Percy or his story. All the time I just thought how dumb he is and the plot points made literally no sense. It was really hard to get trough it and I was really relieved one it was over."
254,1,"I was looking for something to read and because this kept being recommended to me I read it.
Thoughts:
plot: overused incidents, predictable
humor: cliche
characters: unoriginal
dialogue: lack of flow
After considering the book when I finished it, at least I could see why people like it, although that did not induce me to like it."
255,1,"This felt like a Harry-Potter-wannabe. I'm sorry but no human (i know he's a halv-god but He still has human feelings) acts like He does. It just made me cringe reading 12 y/o Percy with hero-thoughts, i mean Come on, he's twelve.
Also The third perspective thing wasn't written good.
Good idea though."
256,1,"I'm probably the only person in the world who doesn't like the Percy Jackson, but it was just too action packed, almost. Every single chapter, I mean, there's just one thing after another. I love the characters, the plot is good, and the way it's written is decent. For some reason, it just didn't appeal to me when it's all put together."
257,1,"I will not finish this book. I only read 25% of it, but it is too much like Harry Potter, and not nearly as good. I find it hard to believe that any child who has already read Harry Potter would enjoy this book. I would have difficulty recommending it to anyone because I think the overall idea of it is much too similar to Harry Potter."
258,1,"This book was nothing of what I expected. I even read the whole series and series after because(hero’s of Olympus) everyone said it was such a good book and I was just waiting for that one really good part everyone tells me about but it never came. It is not worth the time. Try the first book and if you do it like it, don’t continue."
259,1,"Started this one as part of a reading list only to realise it is probably a children's book (and not Young Adult).
Even by those standards it is poorly written with a boring story and a predictable ending. It is based on just one idea, fit elements of Greek mythology in the modern world. Even that looks like force fitting in quite a few places."
260,1,"This book was fine not amazing. It has magic and is fairly gripping and hard to put down. But, the plot falls flat and there is very little showing. I like the idea of children of immortals but the writing wasn't good enough to carry it."
261,1,"I just couldn't finish this book. Generally, I have no trouble with willingly suspending my disbelief--this just went too far for me. I also felt that hints to the plot line were heavy-handed--more whacks in the head than anything. Sorry...I just could not get into this."
262,1,"Meh, I'm not a huge fan. The really juvenile voice bothered me, a lot of details and components of the magical world were inconsistent and sloppy-seeming. I liked the Greek Mythology aspects, but I felt that was one of the onyl differences between this and Harry Potter."
263,1,"The next time I want to read about a teenage boy who didn't know he was magical and then has to save the world with a smart girl and a funny guy, I'll that other series.
I was ok with the simularities, but the story was so forced. And it had monologues at the end. I hate that."
264,1,"The story was fairly entertaining, but it just seemed like such a rip-off of Harry Potter to me. Plus, like my brother-in-law pointed out, it is a story about the illegitimate children of gods. I could see how teens would really enjoy this, though."
265,1,This book is boring. It is too heavy into greek myth with a weird adolescent perspective. I saw the movie and it was okay. It did not follow the book which I think is a good thing. The book had too many mini adventures that were lame.
266,1,"Percy is half blood. He is half human and half god ! trying to save his moms life. making friends and having enemys.he goes through many problems through the book.
i cannot CONNECT ANY WAY.
Terrible book very boring nothing,"
267,1,"I always loved reading Greek mythology as a kid and had high hopes for this, but just thought it was painfully by-the-numbers. I wanted an entertaining, breezy fantasy, but all I got was Harry Potter in Greek myth drag."
268,1,"The author takes Greek mythology and stomps on it. Why, Riordan? Why?! How is that Dionysus?! And Hermes! And even Poseidon--almost all of his children were monsters, not heroes...! Augh... There is something to be said for creative license, yes, but this book takes liberty too far."
269,1,"At first I really liked this series. But by the end I realized what a big waste of time it was. I know many people love it and would be offended by this, but compared to classic literature, it really doesn't stand a chance."
270,1,"I should be better about doing my homework before I read certain books. Never got into this at all, but only because I couldn't stand studying Greek mythology in Jr. High & have never liked it since. If I had, I probably would've loved this book more."
271,1,I wasn't a big fan of it at all I sort of think these books aren't that exciting but thats my opinion so thats my thought and I'm not really going to read another book like this inless it's on accident and I don't know what it is cause I'm not a big fan
272,1,"Couldn't get into it. The reading age was extremely low which made getting past the first chapter tedious.
However, i gave it to my little sister who hasn't read a book all the way through before. She's 13, and really enjoyed it and all of the references to Greek Mythology."
273,1,This was too young adult for my tastes. I was hoping for a good story and it started out interesting but then it just fell into silly road trips and cartoonish characters and left me feeling very old. I wont bother with the rest of this series.
274,1,"I saw this on TV and decided it was rather juvenile and I did not want to read it. I like the original, classic Ulysses story that it pretends to be much better. I can see that it might appeal to younger teen-age boys who read adventure stories, but not to me."
275,1,"Oh, probably work better for the age group it is written for than me. I thought the book was duller and more boring than the movie! Have the rest of the books as well, but guess it's gonna be a while before I read them."
276,1,"Hated this book. I thought the writing was poor, the plot was poor, the characters were underdeveloped... I disliked the morals that were introduced. Surely there has to be a better way to excite kids about Greek mythology. Little Merit."
277,1,Forced myself to read at least 100 pages before I quit. Didn't like it after first 20 and even less the farther I read. Quit before starting page 101. Do not understand all the rants and raves...awards and best books. Wasted 100 pages worth of my time...now on to something much better.
278,1,"Really didn't like this and was surprised. I'd heard good things from people who'd liked Harry Potter - but I found it to be trite, formulaic and overly self-absorbed. Too bad - I was ready for a good series."
279,1,"for anyone who thought the twilight series was bad... this... this, has got to be one of the most awful books ever written. words cannot express how bad this is. I won't bother with the rest of the books, like I did with the twilight series. what a waste of time!"
280,1,"Really glad I didn't buy this book because it wasn't that good. Maybe it's just that everything pales in comparison to Harry Potter. The general idea is good, but there was just some really bad writing at numerous points."
281,1,"Percy was not likeable! he tried to be cool and the book just overall bugged me! Rick Riordan is a horrible writer. Everyone is like ""Peter! You should read the lost hero or red pyramid!"" I just hate these show offy books. The movie made me hate the book even more than I already did."
282,1,"I could not even make myself finish this book. It was cheesy... too cheesy for me. Although, these types of books are not really something I would normally read. So if you don't like mythology books that have twists to them ect. don't read it."
283,1,"I have finally finished it!!

It was OK at the beginning, but got worse by every page. I didn't like or feel for the main characters, I hated the whole idea of the book. I thought it would be totally different.

The truth is, it's not even worth writing a review for!"
284,1,"Couldn't even finish it. I might try to read it again since everyone seems to love the books. Probably didn't help that I had just finished ""The Book Thief"" when I started this, which is an exceptional YA book."
285,1,"I read this book after i watched the movie. And im not into gods and goddesses and too much fantasies when it comes to reading. So, i got bored and read half of it. But, the movie was good. ;> another boy captivated my heart"
286,1,"I read this book on the advice of a friend, who admittedly, reads a lot of bad books. The characters are whiny, the writing is terrible, simple, and in some places wrong, and it's just overall a sad little book. Oh well. I'd have been better off reading Harry Potter again."
287,1,"Formulaic and tiresome. There really was nothing to attract me to this book. Admittedly I am very much older than the apparent intended audience age, but even taking that into account this seemed like a marketing/publisher-driven work designed to cash-in on the burgeoning YA sector."
288,1,"This book was beyond my 9 year old. Thank goodness, since I was slightly sickened of reading him bed time stories with evil spirits and powers. Not a very Christian story for his innocent heart and mind. We quit somewhere around page 50."
289,1,"Hmmm. A boy finds out he's magical, goes to a special school to hone his skills, and then sets out with his two friends (a super awesome girl and a comic relief boy) to defeat a dark overlord. Does any of this sound familiar? Luminos! Hopefully that will spark some original ideas."
290,1,I was quite disappointed it sounded really exciting but when I read it I just couldn't read the second it was just so boring and I love books that keep your eyes glued to the page and this definitely didn't have my eyes glued to the page.
291,1,"This book was decent and was okay as a time-killer. Recommend for people who have nothing to do with their time. This book was not as good as what people exaggerated it would be. I thought it had too much action and humor, and I didn't really get it."
292,1,"Why 1 star?

2 reasons:

1) I'm not a 14 year old. It is no longer easy for me to fall deeply into some fantasy world

2) UNORIGINAL. I've read and seen too many great books/stories that pre-date this one.

* I only read half of the book - reading on would hurt , so why waste more time."
293,1,I really did not enjoy this book because it made no sense and I think that if it was more fast passe especially in the beginning because for me I thought it was really slow so that's why I put it down to 1 star.
294,1,Read this when I was a college freshman. It felt like a chore. It just wasn't enjoyable at all. It bored the heck out of me and I couldn't pinpoint why. The world building just couldn't bring me into it. I wanted to like it so much but I simply couldn't. It's frustrating.
295,1,"This is a good adventure book, not as good as Harry Potter though. They have similar plot style but Harry Potter is more intriguing. Enough about comparing. Overall, this is a good book. I think kids would love it."
296,1,"Read the first 50 pages, and only one thought crossed through my mind - Just abandon this book.

This book was extremely irrelevant to me. :#


BTW, if you find my review offensive, then I am sorry. But I have my full rights to give any kind of review to a particular book. :)"
297,1,"Poorly written, poorly conceptualized, poorly executed. I am sorely disappointed that this has received the positive reviews and success it has. It speaks to our lack of respect and standard we have today for writing."
298,1,"The characters are stupid. The protagonist is annoying. His backstory is cliche as hell.

Also, while ""The Kronos Chronicles"" is not that great of a series either, it handles the whole what-if-pegan-gods-were-real idea in a much more creative way than ""The Olympians"" series does."
299,1,"This book had a nice topic but overall, was written horribly. The characters were very cheesy and literally made to be a popular teenagers biggest dream. At some points in the series I felt as though my heritage was being insulted."
300,1,"I hated this book, and I cannot fathom continuing to read more adventure of characters who are so unbelievable clueless and foolish. At least Hades isn't the ultimate bad guy in this story, as is too often the case."
301,1,"I definitely don't like Greek mythology. The whole time reading this book, I thought how two of my sons would enjoy it much more than me. We are reading it in class so I had to finish it. We spend way too much time butchering every paragraph. Yuck."
302,1,"I tried to like this one - or at least finish it, because it's a favourite of my 10 year old, but I couldn't do it. Stories about gods don't interest me, and I wasn't a fan of the writing style. I gave it a good effort."
303,1,"Characters are flat. The plot is needlessly complicated. The story world is unelaborated (except for the under world,) and the events are staged. This book does not respect the mind. Oh, did I mention that it blindly copies from Harry Potter?"
304,1,"DNF @ 40%

I don't get the glowing reviews for this book. The story was a snooze. The writing was TERRIBLE--""I went here. I ate this. I said X. I did Y. I saw Z."" There's no show, just 100% tell. Also, the narrator does not sound like a 12 year old."
305,1,"This book portrays a world where the Greek gods and hero's are real. That's the main reason I gave it a poor rating. However, if you want a fun way to teach your children about Greek mythology, this book is a great way to do it."
306,1,I think this book was very good the characters were great and the plot twist's were great as well. It also was a very long book which I like long story's. The book it self is really good because it was sad in some parts and some happy and exciting parts in the book.
307,1,"I honestly don't understand why anyone would give this book more than three stars. The writing was terrible, the dialogue was cringey, the world-building was non-existent, and the plot simultaneously dull and erratic."
308,1,"Our poor protagonist can't get a single question answered, despite worldly perils and loyal companions that provide him with little information, withheld for no reason at all. That's not cryptic, that's just annoying."
309,1,"I really wanted to like this book since so many of my students have read it/are reading it. But, I just couldn't do it. I should have abandoned it, but I made it too far I figured I should just push through."
310,1,"I bailed on this book about 1/3 of the way into it. It just didn’t capture my imagination the way other YA books have, I.e. Harry Potter. I decided to stop forcing my time on this book as it wasn’t offering anything in the form of entertainment or bettering myself."
311,1,"Frustratingly poorly written - great story line, compelling plot and characters with potential. This seemingly winning formula is destroyed by terrible application of written English and jarringly unimaginative dialogue. Read the original Greek myths with your kids instead."
312,1,"A mockery of the myths and just ridiculously lazy writing - especially for a kids book. Example: Earthquake decimated LA, everything burning, but they can somehow grab a supersonic flight to NYC? I mean, come on... give kids a little more credit than that."
313,1,"Hey, I'm not above reading juvenile fiction, and I love Greek mythology, so I should have been all over this one. But alas, it was not for me. It reminded me of Johnny Quest. Seems like it should be fun, but it's just a tedious slog."
314,1,"Efterlogg.

I've tried reading this before, and gave up after a few chapters. This time I read the whole damned thing and I still don't understand what the fuss is about. This... isn't funny? It's not interesting? It's bleak and boring and annoying."
315,1,"Meh. A FUCKTON of fatphobia plagues this book, as well as western exceptionalism which was super annoying. People kept hyping this book up as the woke alternative to Harry Potter but honestly? I wasn’t a fan of the anti-indigenous comments and the white-washing of history."
316,1,"I was hoping for a lighthearted and imaginative adventure of mediocre quality, and even at that I was a bit disappointed. The audience seems to be 10 and 11-yr olds rather than young adults, so maybe that's why it was such a miss."
317,1,"i don’t know why but i could never get behind the percy jackson series, even as an avid harry potter fan. i guess you’re either a percy jackson fan, a harry potter fan, or if you’re both- seek medical attention."
318,1,"DNF. I understand I’m not exactly the target audience for this series, but this felt obviously childish. Some children’s books still feel magical and any age can enjoy them for what they are. Percy Jackson isn’t one of them."
319,1,"I really wanted to like this; I even brought the entire series believing I would. But this was a hard one to get through. At times it felt rushed, at times painfully drawn out. I can see why they changed so much for the movie. Many I’m too old for it."
320,1,"The worst and most boring fiction book I’ve ever read, too much description, pointless dialogues, unrelated events. Honestly the only thing I liked reading was the Greek mythology parts, other than that the book is terrible"
321,1,The behavior and language of Percy is something I couldn’t stomach. It’s condoning his disrespectful nature. It details the abusive relationship he has with his step father. We returned the book. These are not appropriate for children.
322,1,"Joelle Reads Her Bucket List #3

Good freaking grief. Now I get why the movie was so incredibly stupid.

This is just about the most worthless, lamest, and idiotic bunch of trope I've made myself read since I survived the Harry Potter series last year.

Utter and complete trash.

The End."
323,1,"This book is absolute crap. I didn’t think it was a bad story, but it’s the more overrated thing I’ve ever seen. As I’m typing this, I’m sure there will be hundreds of crazy fan girls screaming at me in the comments. It had nothing to do with actual Greek mythology"
324,1,"Terrible. The author ripped a bunch of things from other books. It was difficult to get around that, especially in the beginning. It also would've been nice if he kept his politics out of it. This was a waste of time."
325,1,it was the worst book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't even think about commenting about my comment RYAN!
326,1,"readable, but just not that good in the end. clumsy and labored."
327,1,I don't really like the book it's just on of the books I have to do for summer reading.
328,1,I couldn't get through this book. It just felt like another one of those stupid fantasy books that people won't stop writing.
329,1,"I know this was the caudill for 2009 and everyone loved it, but im not a fantasy girl (unless it has to do with vampires!)"
330,1,Didn't engage my attention. It felt like a chore to continue reading.
331,1,"It is horrible, It disgusted me. So nasty.."
332,1,"chock full of page filling blither. modern day kid deals with Zeus, Ares, Poseidon, Persephone...in theme parks, fast food joints. It's a children's book that I wouldn't recommend."
333,1,Overrated.
334,1,the lightning thief by:shianne
335,1,"Fantasy books are hit or miss for me (ex. I don't like Harry Potter, but I love Lord of the Rings). Could barely get through this one. I can see why boys would like it though."
336,1,I had to give it to my 10 year old to read...don't know if I'll get it back...lol
337,1,
338,1,I only read about a third of this book. I didn't like the writing style and I didn't like the story.
339,1,i hated this book it was horriable i dont know How any one could read it!!!
340,1,Badly written and slow. Plus I didn't care much for the characters or plot. Blah.
341,1,All my students love this. I made it 30 pages and wanted to die.
342,1,"A mere shadow, poor rip off of Harry Potter."
343,1,I think that you should not read it because the story does not flow although the character are awesome
344,1,My students read this and recommended it to me. Anxious to get started.
345,1,"The mythological version of Harry Potter. Yes, it is a kid's book and it has action, but kids are smart enough to recognize formulas."
346,1,Cheesy.
347,1,couldn't get into this book.
348,1,"only got through the first few chapters. thought it was poorly written, and just couldn't get into it. written for a younger audience."
349,1,The tone and writing style in general was not very pretty and rather annoying at intervals. The twisted Greek Myth stuff was kinda fun and saved the book from being an utter wash.
350,1,"couldn't even finish it ... so much for ""the next harry potter""!"
351,1,"Made sense that it was turned into a movie because it read like a movie. Filled to the brim with action, but not too much substance."
352,1,This book was in my opinion not intended for anyone over the age of 12. The story was simple and the development of the story itself was amateurish.
353,1,What was i thinking?
354,1,movie was better dont read it
355,1,it was realy wierd to read dis book i only read the first page then i got board
356,1,I started reading this the other day and the writing was so juvenile! :( I was really looking forward to getting into a *series* of books again. I hope the Hunger Games will fulfill my needs!
357,1,Harry Potter ripoff.
358,1,Nothing special. In this case the movie was better.
359,1,Ehh. Not sure that I'll pick up the second one.
360,1,"Attempted to read this, was unable to. The plot seemed so poorly imagined, the writing wasn't great either. Might have been good for kids, though. Usually I enjoy the kids books."
361,1,Kinda boring if you ask me.
362,1,enjoyed the movie. hated the book. had to force myself to finish it.
363,1,don't waste your time on this
364,1,Didn't like the writing style. Liked the movie better.
365,1,"Was ok .. Liked the greek gods, got bored by 3rd book."
366,1,Too juvenile for my liking!
367,1,My brother got this book out from the library so he could read. I read the first few chapters and it was a terrible book! I hated it.
368,1,Couldn't get past the first chapter
369,1,It seemed like it was actually written by a sixth grader. Which maybe is harder to do for an author than I realize but it was annoying to read.
370,1,"Eh, I just didn't like it.

Found it predictable, couldn't relate to and didn't like the character of Percy at all and just couldn't get into it."
371,1,A fun book to read but the story get very predictable.
372,1,"Three reasons I didn't like this book
Reason 1: It didn't make me want to read
Reason 2: It was boring to me
Reason 3: I true it because I haven't read fatasy"
373,1,Might be the worst-written book I've read.
374,1,"Mildly interesting but clearly written for kids, not to my liking."
375,1,"the book is about a guy named percy that has to find and return zeus' master lightning bolt but to do that he has to stay alive from monsters, best, minotaurs, an a teacher bird monster thing."
376,1,i do not like this book. To be honest i think is boring. The book is about this Percy's mom who want to put him on a safety place. and Percy want to find out who his father is !
377,1,I did not like this book and will not continue reading the series.
378,1,i liked the moive better.
379,1,I did not finish reading this book ... don't understand how people can read this stuff!
380,1,"I honestly thought it was boring. I read it, but I diddn't really get into the concept of the whole story. I mean, I won't say it was a terrible book and I recommend it to anyone that likes reading."
381,1,"Shocking.

I thought the film was bloody awful but nothing quite prepared me for this bilgewater.

Avoid like the plague."
382,1,"I gave it a chance, but this is not a good book."
383,1,I personally did not enjoy The Lightning Thief. I felt it was poorly written.
384,1,"Maybe it was the audiobook version that I was ""reading,"" but this was just terrible."
385,1,"i just found the whole premise to be dull, i had really high hopes for this as ive heard its amazing :("
386,1,Meh
387,1,"I didn't even finish it though, l o l."
388,1,Just couldn't get into it enough to want to finish it.
389,1,"I kinda feel disappointed. The book is too young for me, no? All is too easy, too shallow, too one-dimensional. Hardly any surprise, not to mention the horribly simple writing."
390,1,I didn't finish it. The story was just so derivative and predictable on every level.
391,1,"""I'm going to write a book that blends fiction and mythology and a healthy dose of adolescent literature tropes,"" said Rick."
392,1,"This is more for just kids really, not really one of those ""for everyone"" books. The writing is very YA and the plot is very fast."
393,1,Ashley gave me this book to read... thank you Ashley.... I took me a while to get into it.. but I enjoyed it.... partly because I thought of Ashley reading it.
394,1,HATED IT IT SCARED ME TO DEATH WELL PRETTY MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 and i meant to put it in caps
395,1,Rick Riordan has the subtlety of a sledgehammer.
396,1,it wasn't what I expected
397,1,"Disgusting, I hate it. What's the point of the book?"
398,1,I stopped at chapter 3. Bleh.
399,1,I HATED THIS BOOK
400,1,My son made me read this. I was not a fan. Just didn't strike any chords with me.
401,1,"No character building, no pacing. It just felt like the whole thing was rushed."
402,1,This book was very much a children's book- with a fast (and very random) plot and absolutely no character development.
403,1,It is difficult to compete with the Harry Potter series.
404,1,"The plot is full of holes, and so is the world in which the story is set. Also, the main characters are terribly naive. The book is quite bad."
405,1,It was not good at all. I did not appeal to me at all
406,1,"I had a really hard time getting into this book. The story line is very slow, and seems pointless in some spots."
407,1,I couldn't stand this book. I tried but couldn't like it enough to even finish.
408,1,this book is cool I recommend every one to read
409,1,Was not that good the characters were going all over the place. You picture the wrong things when you read every word.
410,1,"i du know. 1.5, because i already knew most of the ending. I'll see how the second one goes. the 0.5 is out of pity, if i didn't already own the books i probably wouldn't have countined reading"
411,1,Started this book on the recommendation of my nephew. Read about half of it but just couldn't finish it.
412,1,This book sucks cant even read it
413,1,Recommended for younger readers...
414,1,"Was not a good book for me, being that I dislike Greek mythology."
415,1,A tiring read.... Would not recommend to any one for sure....
416,1,First book done in book-tube-athon! I did't really love this book but I do think it was written well and if I was younger I'd probably enjoy it more
417,1,An absolute joke to compare this to the legendary Harry Potter series.
418,1,good if you're an 8 year kid that's just learning to read
419,1,How do you start reading a book not Ebooks but just a regular one
420,1,"A little too kid for me. I was on a YA kick but this one did not read like a Hunger Games book. Enjoyed the Greek myth, but that was about all. Will not be reading the sequels"
421,1,"It lost me multiple times, it wasnt my kind"
422,1,I just couldn't enjoy it. Maybe it is better for a younger audience. *shrug
423,1,"The Lightning Thief was a long and boring starter book. It took too long to get into it. For me when it's hard to finish, you know it's not good. This was one of those books."
424,1,I read 3 pages and couldn't take any more. The kid (narrator) was just too much.
425,1,I do NOT recommend this book it is NOT good. I rest my case
426,1,I REALLY don't like this book. It was so hard to get into and it was just boring. I'm sorry if you like it but I think it's really awful. :(
427,1,I attempted reading this and it just was so boring! The characters were sooo unrealistic and difficult to picture
428,1,"I did not like this. It was so weird and just stupid. I'm sorry, but I don't recommend reading this."
429,1,"Let us be clear about this, this story is awful. I don't know why people like it but it's terrible. Badly written and disappointing I present to you the lightning thief."
430,1,"The story runs on pure stupidity.
I hate that the main characters tends to do actions very stupidly."
431,1,"okay, sorry to all of the Percy Jackson fans out there. But i DID NOT like this book or series at all. WAY TO CONFUSING AND TO MANY CHARACTERS."
432,1,"I felt the writing to be a little too middle grade for my taste, so I did not finish it."
433,1,I didn't really like it. It wasn't really that interesting.
434,1,"Didn't finish... Very dark and kind of disturbing how angry this poor kid was. In fact, it was making me angry just reading it."
435,1,this book bored me so much that I wasn't even willing to finish the book.
436,1,"Did not finish- I wanted to like it- too ""young adult""-ish."
437,1,"i didn't like this book it was boring because it is my opinion
i think this book can be recommended for like reader that like fantasy"
438,1,its not the best book ive read in my life
439,1,"I read it, I don't care for it, I am not continuing the series. The book was really confusing and I have like absolutely no thoughts for liking it."
440,1,Protagonist is an asshole and the writing is clearly not meant for readers who've reached puberty.
441,1,I feel like I was probably too old for this when I read it.
442,1,made it a little over halfway before quitting - couldn't get over the cheese factor of the writing
443,1,Non starter really. Not for me.
444,1,"I like children's books, but this was boiled down too simplistically. The story was just being told to me, and I like engaging storytelling that surrounds me instead of just talking at me."
445,1,"It's like Harry Potter, but then boring"
446,1,Was boring and hard to get through
447,1,"I was portrayed very unfairly in this book. Sad to say I won't be continuing the series. Get your facts straight, Riordan."
448,1,I can't understand how 14+ year olds can enjoy this incredibly childish book
449,1,"I thought I would like this book because my friend told me it was good. It was very poorly written, it had weak character and plot development, and it to quickly moving."
450,1,
451,1,Nope.
452,1,*NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S MOVIE*
453,1,Good
454,1,I did not finish this book. I found Percy as a narrator to be very annoying. The book's insistence on worshipping the Greek gods was...unsettling.
455,1,All I have to say is if I could I would give this a 0.
456,1,"It's just bad. It's middle grade fiction, maybe that's why?!"
457,1,"I really wanted to like this book as it has been recommended to me by so many people, but was disappointed by the simplistic writing style and the formulaic characters."
458,1,it was hard to get into this book
459,1,This book blows. The movie was much better. I read it in 7th grade and still remember how boring it was.
460,1,Page 2 was very tasty!
461,1,
462,1,"I found this book to be entertaining, but it was a little fluffy, would have loved a slower pace to develop some atmosphere, a little more description, etc!"
463,1,The book was alright not the best but pretty good because the adventures and the characters
464,1,wtf is this.. how pathetic to try copying Harry Potter and how miserably it failed. Just wtf
465,1,
466,1,i did not like this book that much.
467,1,I put this book down about 10% of the way in. The author lacks subtlety and the main character is weak and oblivious.
468,1,"I just could not buy into this one. Unlikable characters and very dull writing. I can usually live with one or the other, but not both."
469,1,I had tried to read this so many times and could never get past page 100
470,1,boring and not fun to read at all. this book is very bad
471,1,"Jesus Christ, I didn't know someone could write up a book with this racist of a main character and get away with it. How did he get away with this? How does no one notice this?"
472,1,I didnt really like it as much.
473,1,"I hate this book. It has a difficult story line to follow and it just feels very done before. I found it boring and typical, I wouldn’t recommend it."
474,1,"It was horrible, I could not even get to the second book, it was very far fetched!"
475,1,"Only includes Greek gods, no Christian gods."
476,1,Very childish... maybe would have liked it if I read it 18 years ago.. :( DNF
477,1,Crap
478,1,"Terrible book. Can I rate something negative stars?

I mean seriously.

This book sucks, for reasons I just lengthily typed on the PJO haters strand and will not type again."
479,1,Rick Riordan should not continue to be an author. I could barely get through this book
480,1,I personally didnt like it very much. Hopefully the actual books will be better.
481,1,A story that is not for me.
482,1,and I oop-
483,1,not to good
484,1,Look at my review on book 5 for my full view.
485,1,Yuck. Read only because three of my kids love these books and they peer-pressured me.
486,1,I don't really like it
487,1,a good book for young readers. uses a LOT of foreshadowing.
488,1,This is one of those overrated books I've ever read.The whole plot is so stupid.There's absolutely no logic in this whatsoever.And there wasn't a single character I found interesting.
489,1,no❤️
490,1,the only saving grace was that its a short book.
491,1,I... I do not know what to write exactly. The book is a bad harry potter copy/fan fiction. How on earth this has become a bestseller?
492,1,This entire series was a disappointment. The narrator was awful and made the story worse than it already was.
493,1,This book was awesome! I loved it!
494,1,It was alright. Grateful that I've read it but honestly don't see the hype. Ranger's Apprentice by John Flanagan has a much better start and stays consistent throughout.
495,1,"Dnfed!!!
Ik a lot of readers suggested me this and I really wanted to love it...but...uggghhhh...I didn't hit well with this world..."
496,1,
497,1,I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK
498,1,Definitely imaginative but not my speed. I did not enjoy any of it.

513,1,How do i read the book?
514,1,DNF at 25%
515,1,I am decidedly not the target audience for this book.
516,1,it was enticing. idk why my cousin who likes the same genres as me didn't enjoy them. they gave me the entire series their friend gave them because of their disliking.
517,1,i ddint read this but it looks bad
518,1,"Simple writing, cliched and nepotistic character traits, over the top villains encounters,"
519,1,"Maybe there's something I'm missing or something wrong with me, but this might be the worst children's book I have read in a long time."
520,1,Terrible.
521,1,“The dead aren’t scary. They’re just sad”
522,1,Bad never reading another got gifted the hardcover box set and gave it away FOR FREE
523,1,(dnf @ like 60%) i feel like i just read a completely different book to everyone else …
524,1,I can't seem to read the books even though they are in the my books column...I'd like to know how to read the books pls..... HELP
525,1,I never read this when I was younger so I thought I'd give it a shot. I got like halfway through but I had to stop because it was making me hate greek mythology.
526,1,I hated this so much. It took me an embarrassingly long time to finish because I loathed it so much that I couldn’t power through.
527,1,Trash
528,1,In my opinion this book was really boring and it was really hard to keep reading but I pushed through and hated.
529,1,A bunch of rubbish! I couldn’t force myself to even finish it.
530,1,Really felt like a 12 year old WROTE this book.
531,1,"I've read the whole series, so I'm talking about every book in this.
WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR MEN TO WRITE GREEK GODDESSES?"
532,1,I did not like it. It was confusing and the story line made no sense it was that good at all.
533,1,This is my 13th reason
534,1,I couldn’t do it. Got about 50% of the way through but I just really don’t care for mythology in any form.
535,1,worst book ever apsolutely no theme or plot at all
536,1,"i cannot enjoy a book when i dislike the main character. percy drove me nuts, couldn’t stand him the entire time. overrated as hellllll"
537,1,"I read it when i was an adult, so it felt too much like reading a kids book without the nostalgia."
538,1,No thank you
539,1,"I know that each book is different and has its own audience, but I couldn't help comparing it to the Harry Potter series, so maybe that has affected my opinion of the book a lot. Warning: might contain spoilers, also apologies to the fans. Anyway, here is what I think:
1. This felt more like a collection of greek mythology stories all dumped into one book. The book doesn't seem to follow one specific plot. There is a quest to be done and understood, but it's revealed almost halfway through the book. Each time Percy kills or escapes some creature, it's like that alone could've been a quest on its own, but they are described as some mini-games he needs to pass in order to get to the main boss. Of course, a hero is expected to face obstacles on his way but usually, each of those would lead to them discovering some part of a bigger plan or goal, in this story, however, the obstacles are sort of random and have no deeper meaning behind them.
2. Another thing is the characters. Literally the whole universe revolves around Percy, as it should be, but seriously, Percy seems to be doing perfectly fine on his own. Seeing as Annabeth and Grover are with him on this quest, some more credit could've been given to them. Like, Annabeth is supposed to be ""the wise one"" but I saw Percy show way more wisdom than her. It made me think of how in HP Hermione is the smart one and you can actually see that from her actions and contribution to the trio's success.
3. Percy tends to discover more and more of his abilities at the most convenient times, like always. It really feels like the author creates some trouble and only then makes up a new ability for Percy to help him overcome it. Not to be a jerk but again, in HP, Harry had his abilities discovered at, possibly, the LEAST convenient times (like discovering his magic while living with Dursleys or Parseltongue in front of the whole school, making him appear like the bad guy)."
540,1,"Percy Jackson e o Ladrão de Raios ou Como Escrever um Block-Buster com a receita pessoal de JK Rowling!

Na indústria dos livros há dois tipos de abordagem quando uma série faz sucesso estrondoso: se contrata um ghostwriter para que ele crie mais obras com o nome do autor original ou se usa a fórmula já comprovada para atrair aqueles que gostam de mais do mesmo.

Foi assim que Rick Riordan, um escritor no máximo razoável, usando os pontos principais que tecem a trama de Harry Potter, criou o personagem Percy Jackson numa tentativa de dar uma roupagem estadunidense a uma trama de renome internacional.

Percy tem uma personalidade desequilibrada que não compete com a de um garoto de 12 - 13 anos. Seus amigos são igualmente estranhos e obtusos e apenas trocaram de roupagem para não receberem os nomes de Rony e Hermione.

Mesmo os professores, com quem ele tem contato no Acampamento de Meio-Sangues, uma espécie de Hogwarts de Verão, são opacos e praticamente desligados da trama. O autor não consegue conciliá-los com a noção aventureira da série e a idade de Percy, e por isso se tem a impressão que eles sabem o que está acontecendo, mas são incapazes de fazer algo.

Fica difícil de engolir que deuses e centauros de milênios de idade podem ser superados por um garoto de 12 anos, ainda que um semideus.

E esse talvez seja o maior ponto fraco da série, a roupagem mitológica. Para os entendidos, tudo fica previsível demais, para quem não conhece, é muito confuso e as referências não-explicadas - teoricamente subentendidas - podem desmotivar os leitores mais novos.

A linguagem e a escrita, contudo, são bem dinâmicas e por serem simples facilitam a leitura. Talvez não seja a melhor escolha para o seu pimpolho, mas em tempos de rede social... talvez não seja a pior."
541,1,"They say you can read “100-minus-your-age” pages to assess a book’s value. After 64 pages, I had no trouble making a call on Percy Jackson.

Our narrator and “hero,” young Percy, is an underdog, a troubled kid from a messy home who hasn’t managed to succeed yet anywhere in his young life. So far, so good. An underdog hero can be the best sort. But Percy’s attitude is calloused and sarcastic, disrespectful in his narration even as he paints himself as a kid who’s trying to be good and stay out of trouble. Rather than earning his readers’ affection, he demands it.

The writing is mediocre, almost what you’d expect to hear conversationally from a twelve-year-old boy: everything with a tinge of smirking. I suppose this is precisely what makes the book appeal to twelve-year-olds, but it’s not the voice I want my child absorbing. The potty humor, or just shy of it, sours the story even further. Chapter 3 is titled “Grover Unexpectedly Loses His Pants” and Chapter 6 is called “I Become Supreme Lord of the Bathroom.” And those are just chapter titles.

The plot in Percy Jackson is compelling. Were it done well, it could be a wonderful introduction to Greek mythological characters, an effective rags to riches story of a boy who thought he was a nobody coming to grips with his deep significance. Instead, it’s a weak imitation of a true hero story told in language meant to appeal to the masses and, frankly, likely to keep them interested in only the base forms of literature.

For a beautiful story that does all this stuff right, try Mio, My Son or Winterhouse."
542,1,"Maybe my expectations were too high from all the hype, but it was really difficult to finish this one.

It was a cool idea, but read like a NaNoWriMo HP fanfic on its second rewrite. I'm glad the kids like it, but I just can't.

I couldn't help going into editing mode. I want to slash and reorg so much of this book - especially the opening chapters. The middle sagged and characters didn't seem to step into their power (or indeed change in any meaningful way at all). The ending was drawn out and boring.

I could forgive the overly obvious foreshadowing, clumsy wording, lack of descriptions, and maybe even all the telling that should have been showing as YA or first book issues, BUT I just could NOT get over all the blatant contradictions.

Someone really needed to read this book specifically to check for consistency in events and logic (e.g. the bag of coins they got from one person but then later it's said to be from someone else).

Also, I'll accept a 2D character where it makes sense, but there was NO logic of consistency in character motivations either. And the mom and step dad are just... I just can't even get started. Especially to end with mom... Wow. Great message on morality there. And to have a ""protector"" that's totally useless and needs your protection?!?

Okay, I just need to walk away now.

Needless to say, I won't be finishing the series after all."
543,1,"Rick Riordan isn't the best writer, but let's be honest. Camp Half-Blood deserves better. Percy is just unbelievably stupid, and should be put into Juvie, not going to some private school. Percy's mother doesn't have any character growth! She stays the exact same, throughout the little parts she's in, even though she was trapped in the underworld for like 2 months!!! That would change a person, but nooo, not for Rick. You wouldn't find any of these characters in real life, human, demigod, satyr, or not, you wouldn't find these personalities in the real world. The gods are supposed to be all powerful, and all knowing, but they couldn't figure out who took the lightning bolt, and how it was taken. Gods and can't take anything from other gods, so there wasn't really a plot twist when they figured out that it wasn't Percy who took the bolt. They also, for how powerful they're supposed to be, couldn't kill one 12 year-old boy. The only reason this book was fun to read, was to imagine what if I was a demigod, what if I went to camp half-blood, what if I went on this quest. The book itself was just predictable, even a 10 year old kid could figure out what the main character should do before the main character does."
544,1,
545,1,"I wanted to like this book so bad. But I read it, and it was just... bad. I'm sorry to all the Percy Jackson fans out there, but I seriously regret reading it. First of all, the writing was just horrendous. It sounded like a nine-year-old wrote it. Predictable and boring. A boy that's ""different from everyone"" and just can't seem to fit it. Then, it's revealed that he's not actually a human (didn't see that coming...). Sounds familiar, no? Oh, yes, it's Harry Potter but poorly put together. And don't get me started on the characters. The heroic teenager, the love interest, and the quirky best friend. Let's start with Percy. He doesn't have any... well, feelings. His mom dies in front of him, but who cares? Not Percy, that's for sure! He has to go on a deadly quest! But he doesn't care about that either... Then there's Annabeth, who has no other purpose than to be Percy's girlfriend. Riordan tries to make her some inspiring female character, but he fails. Immensely. Then, Grover. Sweet, sweet Grover. He doesn't matter at all. He exists solely for more bodies in the story. Overall, Percy Jackson is not something I would ever really want to think about again."
546,1,"I hated this book. We had to read this book for English so it got boring quickly, I feel like if we didn't have to read it for English I would have read it on my own and liked it. There were too many unnecessary details and, this is my opinion, but I don't like fantasy books that much and I especially don't like Greek Mythology books. There are definitely better books than this and you could never pay me enough money to read this book again or to finish the book series. Everyone is like "" OMG Annabeth and Percy"" like no... just no. This book is a harry potter wannabe, I can go on and on about the similarities and how this book is such a wannabe. Another thing I hate is people simping over Percy Jackson like ""I love him so much he is like my fictional crush"" I get that most of us bookworms have fictiophilia like, but PERCY JACKSON IS DEFINITELY NOT ALL THAT! Anyway, in conclusion, this book sucked, don't read if you want to be disappointed thank you!<3"
547,1,"Ammetto di essermi imbarcata in questa breve avventura (è un libro che si legge in un paio di serate) per motivi di lavoro: nel turismo pare che Percy Jackson sia il fenomeno del momento e che molti ragazzini americani ne vadano pazzi.
E' la classica storia che già riesci ad indovinare dalle prime pagine. Una trama che sembra il riassunto breve di Harry Potter, dove i personaggi sono gli stessi (il prescelto, l'amica secchione e l'altro amico brutto ma buono), ci sono dei mostri che vogliono distruggere il mondo e l'Eroe, poteri sovrannaturali che il protagonista scopre man mano, sogni premonitori, la scuola che lo chiama e lui che torna a casa ad anno finito, insomma gli stessi ingredienti ma conditi di mitologia greca e sintetizzati al massimo.
Se questa è la nuova letteratura per ragazzi stiamo messi male davvero, lo trovo un insulto alla loro intelligenza"
548,1,"Not a fan. If you read this review you may not be a fan of me.

It's pretty obvious the writer is a New England man at heart. Not only does he use words and phrases common to the NE area he also writes about a young man, who has no idea you SHOULDN'T HIT A WOMAN. I can't believe this guy grew up in Texas!

Did you miss that part? I didn't. It's a common New England characteristic for men to want to and be allowed to strike women.

The author downplays it because the protagonist is young oh and he had a right to because that's how an uncivilized person acts when faced with issues.

Go back, reread this, and count how many times Percy mentions, thinks,or follows through physically harming a girl."

en serio este libro está lleno de clichés, y de onomatopeyas osea un niño no es capaz de imaginar como bala una cabra, osea nunca escucho ese sonido, y encima los típicos clichés de libros de niños, la tía que es la bruja mala, y que podemos destruir, si muy a lo cuentos de los hermanos grim.

hey está bien que los dioses estén en todos lados pero en serio vivir en NY en el piso 600 allí está el Olimpo, si creanme eso fue lo que mas me dolió, lo lindo de las series, sagas o lo que sea ue tome la mitologia griega es el Olimpo está en el monte Olimpo, que lls dioses van y viene en el mundo a su antojo peor el Olimpo no se mueve de su sitio.

leer el libro no fue una tortura, más bien me daba una pereza que esa si fue mundial, no se si seguiré la serie"

600,1,"I am not one for myths being present in the modern day, so I am biased in that regard. However, while I would say that it had great potential for a creative and well-developed portrayal of how the ""worlds"" could possibly co-exist without knowing of each other. I don't think it did that.

The main plot in concept is intriguing, in execution, however, it felt more like the author didn't know how to get the characters from the beginning of the book to the end. As it is, the book is very average and is definitely very 2000sish.

Finally, I find the main character to be, truly, an insufferable character. I am not sure if that is what was intended but if it was, I must congratulate the author on making a protagonist so unlikable that you almost forget he is supposed to be the one to succeed in the end. Overall, if I were to describe this book to anyone, I would call it ""a mean-spirited book""."
601,1,"it's an ok story for kids and i was really just reading this as a primer for greek history since i never read it as a child but there is quite a lot of american centric and us/western imperialism in the book even though it's all mentioned off-handedly. lots of uncritical praise for the west rubs me wrong.

really uncomfortable with the amount of commercialism and literal consumerism (namedropping brands - it really dates books) and the attempt to mythologize real historical figures as past demigods feels incredibly inappropriate.

aside from these issues, the book is a fine middle-grade read."
602,1,"I didn't like it.
I don't know why people make it out to be an amazing book. It's, to be completely honest, boring.
The book drones on and on about the same old things. It's Percy that Percy this and I didn't understand, anyway.
I only made it half in before I gave up, deleted the ebook from my laptop and downloaded a much more worthy, more interesting book. That book, in fact, is One Of Us Is Lying. Please check that out. It's amazing.
So what can I say about this? If you are searching for a Harry Potter similar book, don't try this one. There are many books out there that are pretty similar to HP, if that's what you're looking for.
Thank you!"
603,1,"Da questo libro nutrivo grandi aspettative. Mi ha incredibilmente delusa. Tratta i personaggi in modo superficiale e infantile. La trama non è poi così male, ma gli avvenimenti che accadono nel mentre sono a dir poco imbarazzanti. Per non parlare di come la mitologia greca, che è a base praticamente della letteratura e della cultura occidentale, viene trattata e rovinata. Per un bambino questo libro può essere carino, ma dato che me l'avevano consigliato anche persone adulte, l'ho valutato con occhi oggettivi."
604,1,"Falta alguma coisa para este autor. A história tem um potencial incrível, mas ele não se realiza. Algumas passagens são apenas risíveis, diante de tudo o que poderia ter sido escrito. Talvez eu esteja exigindo demais de literatura juvenil, mas realmente esperava mais."
605,1,"Iba kniha pre obyčajných ľudí. Konieckoncov, o opustenom chlapcovi, ktorého vyhadzujú zo školy+ magické schopnosti a bohovia, no o tom sme čítali už toľko krát, že nechápem ako je to ešte možné. Toto nie je literatúra."
606,1,"Well-written book that makes avodah zara seem very real, even attractive. Repulsive references to gods mating with humans to make demi-gods. As the series goes on it gets edgier and edgier until it just falls off the deep end of what could be remotely appropriate for us."
607,1,"Un buen libro para chicos los cuales empiezan con la lectura, es fácil de llevar la progresión de la historia. Es un libro muy entretenido, algo que me ocurrió recientemente es que intenté leer el 3 libro y no pude por que me aburrió la lectura."
608,1,"Empecé este libro sin saber que era tan juvenil. De cualquier manera la voy a seguir porque va a salir la serie, si no fuese por eso, la verdad, no lo continuaría. También porque en algún lado escuche que se pone mejor a medida que avanza."
